item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations certain factors affecting future operating results 
readers are cautioned that the company s actual results could differ materially from those set forth in such forward looking statements 
part i item business general imperial parking corporation as used in this report  the terms impark  we  us or the company mean imperial parking corporation  including its consolidated subsidiaries  a delaware corporation  is a leading provider of parking services in north america 
as of december   we managed  leased or owned  parking lots in canada and parking lots in the united states  containing more than  parking spaces in aggregate  making us the leading parking provider in canada and one of the four largest in north america 
we also provide parking lot patrolling  ticketing and collection services for our own lots and for those operated by other parties 
the company resulted from the combination on march  of the canadian parking assets and operations of first union real estate equity and mortgage investments first union and the parking related business of first union management  inc fumi 
the businesses combined into impark are referred to in this report for periods prior to the combination as follows fur parking business 
the fur parking business  constituting the parking assets and operations of first union  consisted primarily of owned parking properties in canada 
between april and march  subsidiaries of first union operated this business  including leasing the properties to fumi for operations and management 
fumi parking business 
the fumi parking business consisted of the parking services and related ancillary activities that have been continued into the company 
between april and march  subsidiaries of fumi carried on these activities 
the operations of fumi s indirect subsidiaries  imperial parking limited and impark services ltd  consisted of operating and managing parking facilities in canada and the united states and carrying on other parking related activities 
the combination resulting in our formation was completed on march  following a series of transactions pursuant to a detailed plan of organization 
the final step of the series of transactions was the distribution by first union of substantially all of the outstanding shares of our common stock to the shareholders of first union 
industry the parking industry is highly fragmented and competitive 
industry participants  the vast majority of which are privately held companies  consist of a relatively few national companies and a large number of small regional or local operators  including a substantial number of companies providing parking as an ancillary service in connection with property management or ownership 
the parking industry has experienced consolidation as smaller operators have found that they lack the capital  economies of scale and sophisticated management techniques required to compete with larger providers 
we expect this trend to continue and to provide opportunities for us to acquire smaller existing providers 
we expect a number of other trends in the commercial property management business to continue to provide opportunities for large  specialized providers of high quality parking services 
we believe that the trend toward consolidation of property management companies favors larger  nationwide parking providers  as increasingly centralized property management companies and property owners seek to minimize the number of separate parking providers they deal with  as the property management industry becomes increasingly sophisticated and professional  property management companies and property owners will likely seek to work with specialized  professional parking service providers  parking is increasingly seen by building owners as a profit center  and owners are seeking parking providers who can help them to maximize profitability  increase efficiency and reduce financial unpredictability  and the owners of premier properties  as they recognize that the parking experience often provides both the first and last impression of their properties to tenants and users  are seeking to offer the highest possible level of quality in their parking services as a means of distinguishing their properties from those of competitors 
we believe that the industry trends toward outsourcing by private sector owners and privatization by government entities provide additional growth opportunities for parking facility operators 
private sector parking owners have begun to move from owner operator of their parking facilities to outsourcing the management of operations to specialized operators 
this allows them to focus on their core competencies while increasing overall returns on parking assets 
in addition  governments and government agencies  particularly cities and municipal authorities  sometimes retain private firms to operate facilities and parking related services in an effort to reduce operating budgets and increase efficiency 
operating arrangements we operate parking facilities under three general types of arrangements leases  management contracts  and fee ownership 
as of december   we leased parking facilities  operated  parking facilities through management contracts and owned parking facilities 
the general terms and benefits of these types of arrangements are described below leases 
under a lease arrangement  we generally pay either a fixed annual rent  a percentage of gross customer collections  or a combination thereof to the property owner 
we collect all revenues and are responsible for most operating expenses  but are typically not responsible for major maintenance 
in contrast to management contracts  lease arrangements are typically for terms of three to ten years and often have a renewal term  and provide for a fixed payment to the facility owner regardless of the operating earnings of the parking facility 
as a result  leased facilities generally require a longer commitment and a larger capital investment by us than do managed facilities  but generally provide a greater opportunity for long term revenue growth and profitability 
management contracts 
under a management contract  we generally receive a base monthly fee for managing the facilities and often receive an incentive fee based on the achievement of facility revenues above a base amount 
we generally charge fees for various ancillary services such as accounting  supervision  equipment leasing and consulting 
responsibilities under a management contract include hiring  training and staffing parking personnel  and providing collections  accounting  record keeping  insurance and facility marketing services 
in general  the facility owner is responsible for operating expenses such as taxes  license and permit fees  insurance premiums  payroll  as well as  non routine maintenance  repair costs and capital improvements 
the typical management contract is for a term of one to three years often the owner reserves the right to terminate  without cause  on days notice and may contain a renewal clause 
fee ownership 
under fee ownership arrangements  we own the property and fixtures 
ownership of parking facilities typically requires a larger capital investment than managed or leased facilities but provides maximum control over the operation of the parking facility  and all increases in revenue flow directly to us 
ownership provides the potential for realizing capital gains from the appreciation in the value of the underlying real estate  but it also subjects us to risks including reduction in value of the property and additional potential liabilities  as well as additional costs such as real estate taxes and structural  mechanical or electrical maintenance or repairs 
enforcement and collections approximately of our parking lots are operated with parking meters and without parking lot attendants 
we enforce user payment at these lots by having patrollers circulate regularly through lots to identify delinquent parkers and issue violation notices 
we use technology which enables our patrollers to monitor and identify first time and repeat offenders using hand held computers 
the hand held computers are uploaded daily to mainframe computers that track violation history 
this hand held equipment generates violation notices for offenders 
payments on account of these violation notices are handled by our collections operation and are included in our revenues 
growth strategy our strategy is to strengthen our position as the leading parking provider in canada while significantly expanding our presence into selected markets in the united states 
key elements of this growth strategy include increase penetration of existing core markets 
we will seek to leverage our long standing relationships with real estate owners in cities where we currently have significant operations 
our reputation for premium service  our local market knowledge and our management infrastructure  allows us to compete aggressively for new business in these core cities 
because existing parking operations are sufficient to cover the costs of local and regional personnel  we expect that additional parking operations in these markets will provide a greater contribution to our profits than the operations in new markets 
as we compete for new business  we will also strive to retain and improve the profitability of existing contracts 
pursue aggressive growth in other urban markets 
we have targeted major cities in the united states where we currently have little or no presence for aggressive expansion 
in the past three years  we have added new york  san francisco  chicago  philadelphia  cleveland  atlanta and miami to our us portfolio 
we believe that continued expansion in the united states is a key component to enhancing our overall profitability 
the united states is the largest parking market in the world  and members of our management have significant experience in the united states 
also  there are greater opportunities to bid for contracts in the united states than in canada where we are already a leader in our industry 
additionally  we believe parking rates and average profits per facility can be higher in the united states than in canada 
our strategy is to enter a new market only if we believe we can quickly gain a significant position in the market  with sufficient critical mass to compete effectively and realize economies of scale 
certain markets are dominated by national parking companies that have established strong relationships through more advanced parking techniques 
however  where a market is fragmented by a number of smaller less sophisticated parking operators we believe there is an opportunity to gain market share by providing superior systems and controls to prospective customers 
we expect to pursue opportunities in these markets either through acquisition or by establishing our own operations there 
we believe that there are several markets in the united states in which we anticipate gaining market share over the next three to four years 
pursue acquisition opportunities 
we believe there are opportunities to expand our business through the acquisition of smaller operators  both in existing core markets and in other targeted cities where we believe we can attain market share 
the parking industry is highly fragmented and we believe that many of our smaller competitors have limited access to capital or do not have the systems or the scale to compete effectively 
we have completed seven acquisitions in the last eight years  adding approximately facilities 
typically  we seek to acquire small to medium sized local operators with several years of experience in their market 
we believe this allows for the immediate understanding of the market and provides a platform for increased penetration in the same city 
operating strategy we seek to increase the revenues and profitability of our parking facilities through a variety of operating strategies  including the following focus on larger urban markets 
we intend to focus on larger urban markets 
we believe that i urban markets are more resistant to economic downturns  ii property owners and real estate asset managers in these markets typically have a presence in other cities  which provides opportunities to leverage these relationships to expand to new locations  iii the typically higher prices charged in these markets can support our premium service levels  and iv our senior management has significant expertise in these markets 
together  charles huntzinger and bryan wallner have over years of parking experience in urban markets including new york  philadelphia  baltimore  washington  boston  richmond  jacksonville  pittsburgh  cleveland  columbus  cincinnati  milwaukee  denver  san francisco  los angeles  seattle  st 
louis  and indianapolis  as well as toronto and ottawa in canada 
increase proportion of leased facilities 
we intend over time to increase the number of facilities we operate under lease relative to the number we operate under management contracts 
historically  our net profits have been higher on leased facilities than on managed facilities 
although our net profits have been higher from leased facilities  typically these profits increase year over year over the term of the leases 
therefore  we experience lower profits and sometimes losses during the first one or two years of a lease term 
this is illustrated by the table below which groups our leased locations that were active at december  by the year that we opened the location 
year ended december  number of year opened locations revenue gross margin coverage before total includes only those leased locations open as at december  and does not include leased locations operated during the year  but closed by year end 
coverage is calculated by dividing revenue by the amount that revenue exceeds gross margin 
coverage should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
coverage is not an accepted measure under generally accepted accounting principles and other companies will use different measures or different calculations of profitability 
included in the locations above were locations which incurred a loss for totaling million 
of these locations incurring a loss  were opened in and incurred a total loss of million 
our goal is to increase the proportion of leased facilities to managed facilities 
we believe a more balanced mix of leased and managed parking facilities will diversify our operations  providing us with a balance of lower risk and lower profit managed operations  and higher risk and higher profit leased and owned operations 
provide consistently high level of service 
our goal is to provide a uniformly high level of quality and service across all of the facilities we manage  characterized by clean  well lit  secure and pleasant surroundings  attractive graphics and signage  and professional  courteous and well dressed staff 
we offer a wide range of optional premium services  including valet parking  concierge services  car washing  dry cleaning drop off and pick up and vehicle repair 
these premium services are typically offered to owners of first class properties who seek to provide their tenants with the highest possible level of service to help differentiate their property from competing properties 
continue to implement standardized systems and controls 
as a result of our experience in the parking management business  we have developed sophisticated and comprehensive management systems and controls  which we seek to implement uniformly at the facilities we manage 
these systems include accounting and financial management and reporting practices  general operating procedures  training  employment policies  cash controls  marketing procedures and visual image 
we believe that our standardized systems and controls enhance our ability to successfully expand our operations into new markets 
aggressively implement technology and automation 
we believe that automation and technology can enhance customer convenience  lower labor costs  improve cash management and increase our overall profitability 
we have been a leader in the field of introducing automation and technology to the parking business and we were among the first to widely adopt innovations such as the use of credit card payment systems  payment using cellular telephones at unmanned locations  hand held computers to track violators and issue citations  bar code scanners to ensure monthly parkers are using the correct lot and are up to date in payment and entry and exit gates incorporating sensing equipment that can automatically recognize and admit authorized vehicles 
we believe that our higher proportion of unmanned facilities gives us a cost advantage as we compete for business 
we have also developed a sophisticated management information system that enables us to track revenue and manage cash on a daily basis and generate a wide variety of internal reports  as well as customized reports requested by our clients 
implement incentive compensation program 
we have adopted a performance based compensation system for city managers  vice presidents and others based on the profitability of each individual s area of responsibility 
we believe this program will enhance the entrepreneurship of our management employees by tying their compensation directly to improvements in the profitability of the operations they manage and we believe these incentives will encourage them to improve operations and control costs 
provide profitable patrol  enforcement and ticketing service 
we seek to increase the profitability of our overall operations by providing parking lot patrol  enforcement and ticketing services  both at our own facilities and at facilities operated by others 
we believe there are opportunities to market these services to facilities we do not operate  especially those owned by municipalities or by suburban retail centers  who wish to discourage all day parkers by enforcing parking regulations which favor short term parkers 
maintain strict cash control 
strict cash control is critical to our success and that of our clients 
our cash control procedures are based on an auditing system supervised by professional managers and auditors  and include on site spot checks  multiple daily cash deposits  reconciliation of tickets and gate counts to cash collected  local audit functions  managerial supervision and review  and internal audit procedures 
we believe our cash control procedures can be effective in minimizing loss of revenues at parking facilities 
with banks providing better access to account information on a daily basis via the internet  we are able centrally to independently review daily deposits and identify unusual trends for further review 
acquisitions we continue to look for opportunities to acquire small or medium sized parking operators in target markets 
however  none of the opportunities reviewed in resulted in an acquisition being completed during the year 
seasonality we may experience fluctuations in our income from quarter to quarter caused by fluctuations in revenues and related expenses due to the impact of weather and calendar related events on travel and transportation patterns 
additionally  we manage the parking for a number of sports stadiums and arenas and our income from such facilities can be affected by the seasonality of revenue and by the relative degree of success of various sports teams 
historically  our results have been strongest during the quarters that end on june and september competition the parking industry is fragmented and highly competitive  with relatively few barriers to entry 
we compete regularly with a wide variety of parking services providers to retain our existing operations and to expand our operations in existing and new markets 
we compete for clients based on the pricing of our services and our ability to increase revenues and control expenses for each of our client s parking facilities 
our largest competitors in north america are central parking corporation  apcoa standard parking  inc and ampco system parking 
we are substantially smaller in number of locations and revenue than central parking  but we have approximately the same number of locations as apcoa standard and ampco system 
we have lower revenues than apcoa standard because apcoa standard are principally located in the united states where gross revenues generated from a location are typically higher than in canada 
however  being principally in canada gives us a solid canadian base as canadian corporations typically prefer to do business with an established canadian parking company 
additionally  since profit per location is generally lower in canada  most us competitors have historically focused their efforts in the us marketplace where there is higher potential profit 
we also compete with many regional or local parking service providers  as well as municipalities and other governmental entities  property owners and others 
regulation our business is not substantially affected by direct governmental regulation  however  a number of state  provincial and local laws have been passed in recent years that encourage car pooling and the use of mass transit  including  for example  laws prohibiting employers from reimbursing employees parking expenses 
laws and regulations that reduce the number of cars and vehicles could negatively affect our business 
changes in personal privacy or freedom of information legislation at the federal  state or provincial level could also harm our business by making collections of outstanding parking violations more difficult or costly 
we are also affected by laws and regulations such as zoning ordinances and business taxes that are common to any business that owns or leases real estate and by regulations such as labor and tax laws that affect companies with a large number of employees 
under various federal  state  provincial and local environmental laws  ordinances and regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on  under or in such property 
such laws typically impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances 
in connection with ownership or operation of parking facilities  we may be potentially liable for such costs 
although we are not currently aware of any material environmental claims pending or threatened against us or any of our owned or operated parking facilities  there can be no assurance that a material environmental claim will not be asserted against us or against any of our owned or operated parking facilities 
the cost of defending against claims of liability  or of remediating a contaminated property  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
various other governmental regulations affect our operations of parking facilities  both directly and indirectly 
in the united states  these include the americans with disabilities act  or the ada 
under the ada  all public accommodations in the united states  including parking facilities  are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons 
for example  the ada requires parking facilities to include handicapped spaces  headroom for wheelchair vans  attendants booths that accommodate wheelchairs  and elevators that are operable by disabled persons 
we believe that the parking facilities we own and operate are in substantial compliance with these requirements 
employees as of december   we employed approximately  individuals 
we believe that our employee relations are satisfactory 
approximately of our employees some  employees are represented by unions  including the construction and specialized workers union british columbia  christian labour association of canada british columbia  service employees international union regina  saskatchewan joint board  retail  wholesale department store union saskatoon  manitoba government and general employees union winnipeg  teamsters ottawa  san francisco  new york city and chicago  seiu  ufcw toronto  seiu london  and garage employees new york

we are engaged from time to time in routine litigation incidental to our business 
other than cases involving eau claire market  sterling parking ltd  and the city of calgary in calgary  alberta  described below  there is no legal proceeding to which we are a party which  if decided adversely we anticipate could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation or financial condition 
we attempt to disclaim liability for personal injury in facilities we operate 
we also carry liability insurance that we believe meets or exceeds industry standards as determined by our landlords 
we can provide no assurances  however  that any future legal proceedings including any related judgments  settlements or costs will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
other than the final conclusion of the weitz company and weitz golf construction matter  there has been no material change in the status of the litigation described below since our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended september  the eau claire market litigation was filed in the queen s bench of alberta on august  it involves a claim against a property in which imperial parking canada corporation impark canada  a subsidiary of the company and successor to imperial parking limited by amalgamation  is the lessee 
the plaintiff mp acquisitions ltd 
purchased the property and asserts that it did not receive full disclosure of the terms of the impark canada lease 
the plaintiff claims that  as a result  it is entitled to priority over impark canada s lease and to possession of the property 
we believe that this claim is without merit 
if  however  we do not prevail in the litigation  we may be forced to renegotiate the lease with the landlord  in which case the rent could be substantially increased  and any such increase could materially impact our results 
the parties are currently in pre trial proceedings 
a trial has been scheduled to begin on june  we will also be making an application to the court to have the lawsuit summarily dismissed on april  impark canada is a defendant in a lawsuit brought by newcourt financial ltd 
newcourt as the assignee of oracle corporation canada inc oracle 
the suit was filed in ontario superior court on september  the co defendant is first union management  inc fumi 
at the time of the material events alleged in the lawsuit  fumi was an affiliate of impark canada 
the lawsuit alleges that impark canada and fumi owe approximately  under a software licence and services agreement  plus interest and legal costs 
we believe the claim is largely without merit 
in response to the claim  impark canada and fumi have commenced their own action in british columbia  seeking a declaration that no amounts are owing to either newcourt or oracle under the license and services agreement 
the ontario lawsuit has been stayed pending the resolution of the bc action 
the bc action is in pre trial proceedings 
no trial date has been scheduled 
first union real estate equity and mortgage investments fur has agreed in writing to indemnify impark canada with respect to all liabilities and damages that may be incurred by impark with respect to this claim 
fur is an affiliate of fumi and is publicly listed on the new york stock exchange 
impark canada is a defendant in a lawsuit brought by sterling parking ltd  which was filed april  in the queen s bench of alberta 
the suit involves an alleged breach by impark canada of a confidentiality agreement entered into with sterling in october relating to the potential management by impark canada of certain sterling lots in calgary 
the agreement prohibited impark canada from bidding on any sterling lots while negotiations of such transaction were underway 
during negotiations  impark canada successfully bid on two sterling lots 
the proposed transaction with sterling was not completed 
sterling claims in the lawsuit that impark canada wrongfully bid on the two lots and an additional three lots  as well as improperly used sterling confidential information  all in breach of the confidentiality agreement 
the total damages claimed by sterling are approximately million c million 
the lawsuit is in pre trial proceedings 
no trial date has been set 
we believe that sterling s allegations are largely without merit and that the amount of damages claimed is far in excess of the actual damages suffered by sterling  if any 
we have accrued at december  our best estimate of costs related to this action  however  any damages awarded against impark canada in excess of this amount could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operation 
impark canada commenced a lawsuit against the city of calgary in alberta  canada in the queen s bench of alberta on april  the city of calgary had earlier passed a business tax bylaw in imposing a revised method for calculating the business tax payable by commercial parking lot operators in that city 
the new bylaw imposes a business tax on the basis of the square footage of the premises leased or operated  as opposed to the historical method of assessing business taxes on the basis of rent paid by the lessee 
impark canada is applying for a court ruling that the bylaw is void for vagueness or that it is invalid because of its discriminatory effect 
impark canada is also appealing the increased business taxes through the government assessment review process 
we were unsuccessful in our first stage of appeal of the business taxes at the calgary city assessment review board arb and again at our second stage of appeal at the alberta municipal government board mgb 
we are considering appealing the decision of the mgb to the court of queen s bench 
in february  the city of calgary passed a business tax bylaw  which approximately tripled the business tax for impark operations in calgary for the calendar year to approximately million c million 
we were unsuccessful in our first stage of appeal of the business taxes at the arb  and appealed this decision to the mgb in november we are awaiting the decision of the mgb 
we have also amended our lawsuit against the city of calgary to include the assessment 
the lawsuit is currently in pre trial proceedings and no trial date has been set 
in february  the city of calgary passed a business tax bylaw  which imposed the same rate and assessment method of business tax for impark operations in calgary for the calendar year as was used in  at an amount of approximately million c million 
we have filed an appeal of the business taxes with the arb  and intend to amend our lawsuit against the city of calgary to include the assessment 
we believe that the city s  and business tax bylaws are void and invalid 
if we are unsuccessful in appealing the tax assessments  and if we are unsuccessful in our lawsuit against the city of calgary  then a we will not be entitled to the return of any portion of the business tax assessment  which we have already paid in  b we will be required to pay the full amount of the business tax assessment  currently million  for which we have fully accrued such amount at december   and c we will be required to pay the full amount of the business tax assessment  currently million 
on september   a lawsuit was filed by ghilotti brothers construction inc ghilotti in the superior court of california against imperial parking us  inc a subsidiary of the company and herein impark us  weitz golf construction inc and the surety the ghilotti lawsuit 
the lawsuit alleges that ghilotti incurred cost overruns of approximately  relating to the construction of the pacific bell park parking lots in san francisco in the winter and spring of on august   a separate and related lawsuit was filed in the superior court of california by weitz golf construction  inc and the weitz company collectively weitz against impark us and the surety the weitz lawsuit 
weitz and impark us had entered into contracts in november relating to the demolition and construction of the pacific bell park parking lots 
weitz was the general contractor and ghilotti was a subcontractor 
weitz alleged that it incurred cost overruns related to both the demolition and construction  and that it also suffered damages from the release of certain mechanics liens that it had filed against the parking lots 
weitz claimed damages in the aggregate of million  which includes the amounts claimed by ghilotti against weitz and impark us in the ghilotti lawsuit 
both the weitz lawsuit and the ghilotti lawsuit were stayed  pending final and binding arbitration involving all parties 
on april   impark us entered into an agreement with weitz to settle the weitz lawsuit 
the material terms of the settlement agreement are that a impark us has paid million to weitz on may   b weitz will be solely responsible for resolving the ghilotti lawsuit  and impark us will reimburse weitz up to  of the amounts paid by weitz in connection with the final settlement or resolution of such lawsuit  based on a specified formula  c weitz has discontinued the weitz lawsuit

previously  expenses directly reimbursed under management agreements were netted against the reimbursement received 
prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the presentation of these reimbursed expenses 
adoption of the pronouncement resulted in an increase in total revenues and total direct costs  in equal amounts  of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
this accounting change has no impact on operating earnings or net earnings 
the number of facilities operated as at each fiscal year end under each of these arrangements is as follows as at december  leased facilities managed facilities owned facilities results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenues for fiscal increased million  or  to million from million for fiscal the increase was due largely to an increase in revenue on leased facilities in the us  and includes the results for dlc  which was acquired effective july  revenues from leased facilities for fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
there was an increase of million in the united states as a result of starting operations in atlanta august and chicago november and the acquisition of dlc in philadelphia july 
however  we have also experienced a drop in volume and in rates in our established cities of minneapolis and milwaukee as a result of layoffs by businesses operating downtown and pressure from competitors to lower rates 
consequently  we decided not to renew a significant lease in minneapolis in the fourth quarter of revenue from these two cities declined million in from there was a million decrease in leased revenue in canada substantially due to a decline in the value of the canadian dollar from an average rate for fiscal of c us to c for  and to higher traffic volumes in fiscal as a result of public transit strikes in calgary  alberta and vancouver  bc leased revenue in canada for fiscal also included the recovery of million for taxes previously provided on parking violation revenue 
management contract revenues for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million for fiscal million of the increase was due to a full year of operations from dlc  which was acquired in july the cost of parking and management contracts in increased to million from million in  an increase of million  or 
of this increase  million was attributable to higher rent expense and million to other directs costs 
rent expense increased million  or  from million for to million for rent as a percentage of leased revenues  increased to in from for the increase is due to many of the leases in the us being in the first or second year of their terms 
as we continue to operate these leased facilities  we would expect growth in revenue to exceed any growth in rent and  therefore  rent as a percentage of revenues would decline 
the increase in other direct costs of million  or  from million to million  is due to the acquisition of dlc and the increase in leased revenues 
the cost of parking and management contracts as a percentage of revenues from parking and management contracts increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase is due to a higher proportion of our business in  compared to  being generated in the us where we are in a start up phase in many cities 
we expect only to be in a break even position  or marginally profitable  in these new cities during their first one or two years of operation 
the current weak us economy may prolong this period  during which we may generate lower than average returns in these new cities 
we are appealing our business tax assessment for our operations in calgary  alberta 
we have also applied for a court ruling that the applicable business tax bylaw is void or invalid 
the assessment for of approximately million is three times the amount of our assessment for of approximately million 
we have accrued at december  for the full amount payable under the assessment 
we have provided further details of this issue in this annual report in part i  item legal proceedings 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses is due  in large part  to including dlc for a full year  which added million of general and administrative expenses and to an additional million for cities started during this was partially offset by a decrease in stock compensation expense of million from million for fiscal to a recovery of  for fiscal  as a result of a decline in our stock price 
general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of total revenues  decreased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal in  we will be recording stock compensation expense using the fair value method of accounting for stock options which vest in  and thereafter 
we will also be restating the results of prior periods to assist in the comparison of results of operations between years 
had we applied the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation in and  stock compensation expense would have been million for each year 
we have provided further details on the assumptions we used in determining the fair value amounts for and in note to our consolidated financial statements 
there was no amortization of goodwill in fiscal  compared to million for fiscal this is a result of adopting financial accounting statement no 
 which does not permit amortization of goodwill  but requires goodwill to be reviewed annually for any impairment in value 
on adopting sfas no 
 an initial test for impairment in the carrying value of goodwill was required as at the date of adoption  january  during the second quarter of  we completed the process of determining the fair value of each of our reporting units and comparing that to their carrying values 
we concluded from this initial test that the fair market value of each of our units exceeded their carrying values  and no further work was required to test for impairment in the carrying value of goodwill at january  in the fourth quarter of  we completed an annual test for impairment in the carrying value of goodwill as of november  and concluded that the fair market value of each of our units still exceeded their carrying values at that date 
interest income decreased million from million for fiscal to million for fiscal principally due to lower prevailing interest rates 
interest expense of million was incurred in fiscal on the bank and other indebtedness to finance the dlc acquisition  which was million more than the million incurred in fiscal the expense in was for a partial year as the acquisition of dlc occurred during income tax expense for fiscal includes our current tax liability for capital and state taxes  and a deferred tax expense as we utilize our previously recognized benefits of net operating losses for tax purposes in canada 
the deferred tax expense has been reduced by a deferred tax recovery for operating losses in the us for fiscal we expect that we will have utilized all of our net operating losses in canada by the third quarter of  at which time we will begin to incur a current  rather than a deferred  tax liability for any operating profits in canada 
accordingly  the tax benefit of the canadian losses we expect to realize in the next twelve months  which is disclosed as a current asset on our balance sheet at december   has decreased from the balance at december  the net income for was million  an increase of million from the net income for of million 
this increase is primarily due to higher gross margin of million  lower depreciation and amortization of management and lease agreements of million  and discontinuation of goodwill amortization of million  offset by higher general and administrative expenses of million  a decrease in net interest income of million and higher income tax expense of million 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenues for fiscal increased million  or  to million from million for fiscal the increase was due largely to an increase in revenue on leased facilities  and from including the results for dlc which was acquired effective july  revenues from leased facilities for fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
million of this increase was in the united states and resulted from starting operations in san francisco april  cleveland september and atlanta august and the acquisition of both e z park in cincinnati april and dlc in philadelphia july 
the increase of million in leased revenue in canada included a recovery of million related to our settlement of a dispute over direct taxes on parking violation revenue 
fiscal included a reduction of revenue of million based on estimates of our tax liability at the time 
during fiscal  we were successful in recovering million during fiscal of the amount previously provided 
we do not expect any further benefits in the future from settling this tax liability 
the remainder of the increase in canada of million was due in part  to parking rate increases and a public transit strike in calgary  alberta and vancouver  bc management contract revenues for fiscal increased to million from million for fiscal an increase of million  or 
the increase was solely attributable to the acquired dlc contracts 
the cost of parking and management contracts in fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal  an increase of million  or 
of this increase  million was from dlc s operations  million was attributable to higher rent expense  and million to other directs costs 
rent expense  excluding amounts attributable to dlc  increased million  or  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal rent as a percentage of leased revenues  increased to in fiscal from in fiscal this increase is principally due to the leases in our new us operations being in the early phase of their terms 
as we continue to operate these new leased facilities  we would expect revenue growth to exceed any growth in rent and  therefore  rent as a percentage of revenue to decline 
the increase in other direct costs of million  or  from million to million  is due to the general increase in revenues 
the cost of parking and management contracts as a percentage of revenues from parking and management contracts increased to in fiscal from in fiscal general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses is due  in part  to the acquisition of dlc  which added million of general and administrative expenses  and expansion since last year in the united states  including million for operations in san francisco  cincinnati  cleveland  and atlanta and million to establish a regional management infrastructure in the united states 
we also incurred million of additional expense related to being a public company and million of increased stock compensation expense  as discussed below 
general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of total revenues  remained at for both fiscal and included in general and administrative expense is stock based compensation expense for fiscal of million which includes an allocation of both senior management s compensation related to our stock performance and directors annual stock entitlement for services rendered 
in fiscal there was million of stock based compensation for stock awarded to directors  but no stock compensation expense for senior management 
the allocation for senior management s compensation is based on the stock incentive plan which was approved by the stockholders at our annual meeting 
the plan includes variable stock options whereby the exercise price of the options increases during the term of the options 
accordingly  any change in the intrinsic value of the options is reflected as a compensation expense on a quarterly basis 
depreciation and amortization decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal included in these amounts is goodwill amortization of million for fiscal and million for fiscal with the adoption of the financial accounting statement no 
 goodwill will no longer be amortized effective fiscal onwards 
however  the carrying value of goodwill is subject to a regular impairment test 
the equity share in the limited liability company llc losses represents our share in nine llc s which each operate a parking facility in new york  new york 
the llc s started operating these facilities in fiscal interest income of million was earned in fiscal compared to million in fiscal although the interest income in was earned during only a period of nine months from the combination in march  interest rates in were higher by approximately 
interest expense of million for fiscal represents interest on the bank loan to finance the acquisition of dlc and imputed interest on the portion of the purchase price that is deferred 
income tax expense for fiscal includes our current tax liability for capital and state taxes  and a deferred tax expense as we utilize our net operating losses for tax purposes in canada 
the deferred tax expense has been reduced by a deferred tax recovery for operating losses in the us for fiscal there was no corresponding deferred tax expense in fiscal  as we had not then recognized the canadian tax losses for accounting purposes 
net earnings for fiscal were million a decrease of million from the fiscal pro forma earnings of million 
this decrease is primarily due to a million increase in general and administrative expenses  equity losses of million in the llc s  lower net interest income of million  and higher income tax expense of million  offset by a higher gross margin of million and lower depreciation and amortization expense of million 
liquidity and capital resources as at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
this represents an increase of million for fiscal from the balance at december  the increase resulted from million of cash generated from operations  offset by million used in investing activities and million used in financing activities 
in the event of a further downturn in the economy  we would expect the cash generated from our operations to decrease 
the cash used in investing activities during fiscal included million used to acquire the rights to a parking lot lease and two management agreements in new york city  ny 
we also paid million to the former shareholders of dlc during fiscal of this  million was for an adjustment to the amount owed for the acquired working capital  and million was the first of five annual deferred contingent payments 
the latter amount was calculated pursuant to the amended and restated share purchase agreement exhibit and was based on the earnings of the acquired operations for the year ended june  we had previously accrued million of this payment as part of our acquisition 
the difference of million has been allocated to goodwill 
in april  we reached a settlement with the contractor of the san francisco giants development regarding final costs 
under the settlement we paid the contractor million and  based on claims now settled with a sub contractor  we are required to pay a further amount of less than million 
the settlement also resulted in the cancellation of a previously outstanding letter of credit for million 
following the settlement with the contractor  we were able to calculate the giants share of the final development costs 
the giants share is million  including interest  of which we have been able to recover million at december  from participation rent owing to the giants 
the balance of million at december  is included on our balance sheet in other assets  and the current portion in accounts receivable  with a corresponding reduction in recoverable developments costs 
in february  we accepted an early settlement of the balance owing from the giants at a discounted amount of million in cash 
at december   we had million of bank debt outstanding 
after borrowing these funds and using million for outstanding letters of credit  we have million remaining of our credit facility with hsbc canada to fund working capital requirements  acquisitions and other capital investment opportunities 
in  and in previous years  we have not had a current tax liability for income tax in canada due to the availability of tax losses 
we estimate that these losses will be fully utilized during assuming that the taxable income in canada in and were the same as  we would incur a current tax liability for canadian income taxes of approximately million for  payable in  and approximately million for  payable in installments during and any balance in in january  we entered a standstill agreement with our principal shareholder  gotham partners and its affiliated funds  which own approximately of the outstanding shares of the common stock of the company 
under the agreement  we have until may  to explore alternatives available to us in the context of gotham partners decision to sell its ownership interest in the company 
we have engaged independent advisors to assist us with this process and have committed to pay our financial advisor a fee of not less than million 
in the event that a transaction is consummated regarding the ownership of the company  up to an additional million in fees could be payable to our advisors 
the actual amount is dependent on the nature of such a transaction 
in addition  we expect to incur legal and other expenses as we explore alternatives available to us 
in the next months  we anticipate the working capital necessary to satisfy current obligations will be generated from operations  available cash  and our bank facility 
depending on the timing and magnitude of future investment opportunities  which could be in the form of leased or purchased properties  joint ventures or acquisitions  we anticipate the cash required to come from operations  the bank credit facility  or an equity offering 
in the future  if we identify investment opportunities requiring cash in excess of operating cash flows and credit facilities  we may seek additional sources of capital  including the sale or issuance of our common stock  or amending our credit facility to obtain additional indebtedness 
no assurances can be given that such increases would be available at the time needed to complete any such acquisition 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following tables summarize our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  payments due by period amounts in thousands less than total year years years after years bank indebtedness operating leases other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations the bank indebtedness has been reflected as payable within one year as it is repayable on demand 
however  it is currently being repaid in blended monthly installments of principal and interest of  through december other long term obligations include an estimated million payable to the former shareholders of dlc 
the amounts ultimately payable to the former shareholders are calculated relative to the actual operating results of the acquired business for the four remaining annual periods ending june  and may differ from the amount estimated at december  to be payable

in preparing the consolidated financial statements  estimates and judgments are applied that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities for the reporting periods 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable in the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
on an on going basis  we evaluate areas of estimate or judgment to ensure they reflect currently available assessments and knowledge 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates 
the consolidated financial statements reflect our estimates of the value of goodwill  management agreements and fixed assets arising from historical transactions 
in assessing the underlying value of these assets  we consider estimates of future cash flows to be generated from the assets over their estimated useful life 
various factors  including customer demand  weather  transit use and government policies  could change thereby impacting these estimates  possibly materially 
these factors are substantially outside of our control 
beginning january   we have accounted for goodwill under the provisions of sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
as of december   we had million of goodwill 
the determination of fair value of goodwill  and any impairment loss  utilizes cash flow projections that assume certain future revenue and costs levels  assumed earnings multiples based upon current market conditions and other valuation factors  all of which involve the use of significant judgment and estimation 
future events may indicate that judgments and estimates that we made to support the carrying value of goodwill at december  are no longer appropriate 
this could  in turn  result in impairment charges in the future 
future events that may result in impairment charges include increases in interest rates  which would impact earnings multiples  unfavourable economic conditions or other factors which could decrease revenues and profitability of existing locations  and changes in the cost structure of existing facilities 
factors that could potentially have an unfavourable economic effect on our judgment and estimates include  among others changes imposed by government and regulatory agencies  such as assessment of parking related taxes  construction or other events that could change traffic patterns  and terrorism or other catastrophic events 
the consolidated financial statements reflect deferred income tax assets based on our assessment that we are more likely than not to be able to utilize certain deductions in the future  primarily loss carry forwards 
changes in the timing of the recognition and amount of revenues and expenses in the future may impact our ability to utilize these deductions 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  we will be required to adjust our deferred tax valuation allowance 
under the terms of the agreement to acquire dlc  we are required to make annual payments to the former shareholders of dlc for each of the twelve month periods ending june  through the payments are calculated relative to the actual operating results of the acquired business determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
each twelve month period calculation is independent and separable from each other twelve month period calculation 
in making this calculation  a multiple of is applied to each future twelve month period s earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda less depreciation of any new capital expenditure on the acquired parking facilities  and one tenth of that amount is payable in cash at that time 
at december  we estimated this liability  based on operating results of the acquired business for  to be approximately million per annum for each of the periods through june  we have accrued for this amount in our consolidated financial statements as at december  the actual amount to be paid for any given year may differ significantly from our estimate as it depends on the actual operating performance of dlc and is not subject to any limit 
however  the former shareholders of dlc are required to make up any shortfall  up to  in the ebitda of the acquired business below million for any of the twelve month periods through june  a change of in our estimate of operating results would result in a change of approximately million per annum in the amount payable to the former shareholders of dlc for each of the periods through june  new accounting pronouncements in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations which provides accounting requirements for retirement obligation associated with tangible long lived assets for which the legal obligation to settle is a result of an existing legal obligation  including those obligations to settle due to an existing or enacted law and written or oral contract 
such an obligation would be recognized in the period in which it meets the definition of a liability  and on initial recognition  the liability would be measured at fair value 
sfas does not require the asset retirement obligation to be measured at fair value each period 
instead  it requires the recognition of changes in the liability resulting from the a the passage of time and b revisions in cash flow estimates 
sfas also addresses the accounting for the costs associated with an asset retirement obligation 
an asset retirement cost is to be capitalized as part of the cost of the related long lived asset and charged to earnings using a systematic and rational method 
sfas is effective for years beginning after june  the company has not yet determined the effect of sfas on the consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb released statement of financial accounting no 
sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas relates to the recognition of a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity and requires that a liability be recognized for those costs only when the liability is incurred  that is  when it meets the definition of a liability under the fasb s conceptual framework 
previously  a liability for an exit cost was recognized when an exit plan was committed to 
sfas also established fair value as the objective for initial measurement of liabilities related to exit or disposal activities 
as a result  sfas significantly reduces the ability to recognize a liability for future expenses related to restructuring 
certain costs that were recognized as liabilities at the date an exit plan was committed to  will no be recognized at a later date 
in addition  sfas provides additional guidance for the recognition and measurement of certain costs that are often associated with exit or disposal activities including one time termination benefits and other associated costs 
sfas is effective for exit and disposal activities initiated after december  sfas will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements of the company on adoption 
in december  fasb approved the issue of statement of financial accounting standard no 
 sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas provides for three transition options for adopting the principles of sfas for measuring stock based compensation granted to employees 
the provisions of sfas also increase the prominence and frequency of financial disclosure including additional disclosures of stock based compensation amounts in year end financial statements and sfas will require that interim financial statements include similar disclosure relating to stock based compensation as is presently required for year end financial statements including all of the disclosure provisions of sfas sfas is effective for years ending on or after december  and the company has provided the disclosures required in notes o and b to the consolidated financial statements 
foreign currency exposure we operate wholly owned subsidiaries in canada 
total historical revenues excluding reimbursement of management contract expenses from canadian operations amounted to million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
we intend to continue to invest in canadian facilities  and may identify expansion opportunities in other foreign countries 
our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is limited as the canadian dollar revenues have to date been significantly offset by canadian dollar operating costs 
our net earnings in canada for were approximately million  or approximately c million translated at the average exchange rate for of us c 
if the exchange rate used in had been c instead of c  the effect would be to reduce our net earnings by approximately million 
presently  we have no formal hedging programs 
we would consider implementing a hedging program if such risk materially increases 
impact of inflation and changing prices our primary sources of revenues are parking revenues from owned and leased locations and management contract revenue net of expense reimbursements 
in the years ended december  and inflation had a limited impact on our operations 
quarterly results we may experience fluctuations in our income from quarter to quarter due to fluctuations in revenues and related expenses due to acquisitions  pre opening costs  travel and transportation patterns affected by weather and calendar related events  and local and national economic conditions 
additionally  we manage the parking for a number of sports stadiums and arenas and our income can be affected by the relative degree of success of various sports teams 
information on our quarterly reported revenues  net income loss and earnings loss per share is disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements in this report 
certain factors affecting future operating results this annual report  including the information incorporated herein by reference contain certain statements that may be considered forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of you can identify forward looking statements by the use of the words believe  expect  anticipate  intend  estimate  assume  will  should  and other expressions which predict or indicate future events or trends and which do not relate to historical matters 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements as a result of  among other factors  the factors discussed below  our ability to successfully integrate past and future acquisitions  our ability to form and maintain strategic relationships with certain large real estate owners  and changes in assumptions used in making such forward looking statements 
readers should carefully review the factors described on below and should not place undue reliance on our forward looking statements 
the company assumes no obligations to update any forward looking statements 
a significant shareholder intends to sell their shareholding gotham partners and its affiliated funds gotham own approximately of the outstanding shares of the common stock of the company 
they have decided to sell their ownership interest in the company 
we have entered into a standstill agreement with gotham that restricts their ability to divest their ownership interest in the company prior to may  without the consent of the board of directors 
the board of directors has appointed a special committee of directors to explore strategic alternatives available to the company in the context of gotham s decision 
the sale of gotham s ownership interest may result in a number of changes  including possibly changes in the control of the company  the board of directors  management  capital structure  growth and operating strategies 
the process to explore alternatives will also require management s time and attention  and may mean less time devoted to following our stated growth strategy 
we have also engaged independent advisors to assist us with the process and have committed to pay our financial advisor a fee of not less than million 
in the event that a transaction is consummated regarding the ownership of the company  up to an additional million in fees could be payable to our advisors 
the actual amount is dependent on the nature of such a transaction 
in addition  we may incur significant legal and other expenses as we explore alternatives available to us 
these costs could have a materially adverse effect on our future results of operations and on our financial condition 
our growth strategy may not succeed as part of our business strategy  we intend to pursue acquisitions of other parking operators 
in executing our acquisition strategy  we may be unable to identify suitable acquisition candidates 
in addition  we expect to face competition from other parking providers for acquisition candidates  making it more difficult to acquire suitable companies on favorable terms 
if we pursue any acquisition  our management could spend a significant amount of time and effort in identifying and completing the acquisition 
if we complete an acquisition  we may have to devote a significant amount of management resources to integrating the acquired business with our existing business 
an acquisition might not produce the revenue or earnings that we anticipated  and an acquired operation may not perform as expected 
accordingly  our acquisition efforts may not succeed 
in addition  from an accounting perspective  an acquisition may result in non recurring charges or involve significant write offs of goodwill that could adversely affect our operating results 
to pay for an acquisition  we might use capital stock or cash 
alternatively  we might borrow money from a bank or other lender 
if we use capital stock  our stockholders may experience dilution 
if we use cash or debt financing  our financial liquidity would be reduced 
we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient access to capital to permit us to implement our acquisition strategies 
we also intend to pursue aggressive growth in targeted major cities in the united states 
however  we may not be able to sign up parking contracts in these cities due to competition from existing operators or reluctance from landlords to enter into agreements with an operator who is new in the local market 
furthermore  if we are able to add new facilities  we may incur losses on these new locations during the first or second year of operations as we attempt to achieve projected revenue targets by optimizing parking rates and marketing the facility 
severe winter weather may adversely affect our business the parking business depends on the free flow of vehicular traffic 
severe winter weather conditions in canada and the northern united states could close or significantly slow roadways 
this  in turn  may harm our business and adversely affect our cash flow by reducing the demand for parking and increasing our snow removal costs 
changes in privacy legislation could harm our business by making collections more difficult and costly city collection company limited city collections  an impark subsidiary  identifies vehicle owners in canada through searches based on license plate numbers 
the license plate data are maintained by each province in canada 
although most provinces have enacted privacy legislation regulating access to such data  city collections has entered into access agreements with several provinces 
should more restrictive privacy legislation be enacted it could adversely affect city collections business 
in  a committee of the provincial government of alberta made a recommendation to amend existing legislation that would deny parking companies access to motor vehicle records 
if the alberta legislature accepts such recommendation  it could adversely impact our collection efforts and reduce the revenue we earn from parking violations in alberta  canada 
in addition  fees charged for searches of motor vehicle registration are also set by provincial governments and any increase in these fees will have an adverse effect on city collections business 
an increase in the cost of insurance claims and changes in the insurance marketplace could increase our costs we typically have a large number of small property or personal injury claims 
we have insurance to cover the cost of these claims  to the extent such costs exceed a deductible amount 
however  a major increase in the number and cost of claims to the insurance company could significantly increase the amount that we pay to insure against these claims 
additionally  due to changes in the insurance marketplace  including changes related to the terrorist attacks on september   we have experienced an increase in the premiums we pay for most types of insurance coverage 
changes in the insurance marketplace  including increased premium costs  could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and on our financial condition 
currency fluctuations could adversely affect our financial results while our consolidated financial statements are prepared in united states dollars  many of our operations are conducted in canadian dollars 
fluctuations in exchange rates may have a material adverse effect on our financial results  particularly our operating margins  and could also result in exchange losses 
to date we have not sought to hedge these risks  but may undertake hedging transactions in the future 
we cannot be certain  however  that any hedging techniques would be successful in preventing or limiting the adverse financial effects of exchange rate fluctuations 
we face risks associated with environmental regulations various federal  state  provincial and local environmental laws and regulations impose liabilities on a current or previous owner or operator of real property for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on the property 
these laws typically impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of the hazardous or toxic substances 
in connection with our ownership  operation or acquisition of parking facilities  we may be potentially liable for such costs 
although we are currently not aware of any material environmental claims pending or threatened against us or any of our owned or operated parking facilities  we cannot give any assurance that a material environmental claim will not be asserted against us or against our owned or operated parking facilities 
we could face significant costs in defending against claims of liability or in remediating a contaminated property 
an increase in government regulation or taxation could harm our business the parking business is subject to a significant degree of government regulation 
the regulations include potentially costly matters such as requiring improvements to meet civic by laws  worker s compensation regulations and labor standards  as well as  environmental and other potentially costly legislation 
any new or increased levels of regulation could adversely impact our business 
the parking industry is also subject to increased taxation from the various levels of government 
historically  it has been considered as an environmentally unfriendly industry due to its primary purpose  which is to park automobiles driven into downtown business districts 
consequently the parking industry has been the subject of significant taxation including federal  state and provincial sales taxes  property taxes  business taxes and federal and provincial state income taxes 
our business will be adversely affected by any significant new tax legislation or increased levels of taxation  any of which could be retroactive 
various other governmental regulations affect our operation of parking facilities  both directly and indirectly  including air quality laws  licensing laws and the americans with disabilities act of under the ada  all public accommodations  including parking facilities  are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons 
although we believe that the parking facilities we own and operate are in substantial compliance with these requirements  a determination that we or the facility owner is not in compliance with the ada could result in the imposition of fines or damage awards against us 
in addition  several state  provincial and local laws have been passed in recent years that encourage car pooling and the use of mass transit  including  for example  laws prohibiting employers from reimbursing employee parking expenses 
laws and regulations that reduce the number of cars and vehicles being driven could hurt our business 
we have significant competition from a variety of sources the parking industry is highly competitive 
our competitors range from small single lot operators to large regional and national multi facility operators  and include municipal and other governmental entities 
some of our present and potential competitors have or may obtain greater financial and marketing resources than we have 
furthermore  we compete for qualified management personnel with other parking facility operators  with property management companies and with property owners 
we may encounter increased competition in the future 
among other things  increased construction of parking facilities could limit our ability to attract customers  expand our business or maintain profitable pricing levels and could decrease our market share 
we compete for acquisitions with other parking facility operators  real estate developers and real estate investment trusts 
we may encounter increased competition for acquisitions in the future  and this competition could hurt our ability to complete acquisitions or have the effect of increasing the prices we must pay for acquisitions 
we believe that there will be rapid business consolidation in the parking services industry 
if this occurs and we are unable to participate successfully in the business consolidation  our business and financial results could be harmed 
a labor strike could hurt our competitiveness a significant number of our employees are members of labor unions 
as a result there is more risk of work stoppages due to strikes which could potentially be costly to us because increased labor costs could adversely affect our ability to retain management contracts and to remain competitive in the marketplace 
the large number of leased facilities increases the risk that we may not be able to cover the fixed costs of our leased facilities we leased and owned facilities as of december  although there is more potential for income from leased and owned facilities than from management contracts  they also carry more risk if there is a downturn in property performance or commercial real estate occupancy rates because a significant part of the costs to operate such facilities typically is fixed 
for example  in the case of leases  there are typically minimum lease payments  and in the case of owned facilities  there are the normal risks of ownership and costs of capital 
in addition  maintenance and operating expenses for both leased and owned facilities are borne by us and are not passed through to the owner  as is the case with management contracts 
generally  performance of our parking facilities depend  in part  on our ability to negotiate favorable contract terms  our ability to control operating expenses  financial conditions prevailing generally and in areas where parking facilities are located  the nature and extent of competitive parking facilities in the area  weather conditions and the real estate market generally 
the relative significance of our leases can be viewed in relation to the term remaining on currently active leases and the extent to which the direct costs of operating those leased facilities historically have been covered by revenue generated by the facilities 
this is illustrated by the table below  which groups our leased locations that were active at december  by the year that the related agreement will expire  as follows year ended december  term expires revenue direct costs coverage and thereafter total for leased locations that were open as at december  direct costs included minimum rental payments  contingent payments based upon a percentage of revenues  property taxes and other operating expenses 
coverage is calculated by dividing revenue by direct costs 
coverage should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute of measures of performance prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
coverage is not an accepted measure under generally accepted accounting principles and other companies will use different measures or different calculations of profitability 
several of our locations are dependent on sports related traffic several of our leased facilities are located beside or in the vicinity of major sporting arenas 
a significant proportion of the revenue earned at these locations occurs during regular and post season games 
in  approximately of our revenue was earned from customers attending baseball games 
a player strike or other work stoppage leading to the cancellation of games  or a reduction in attendance at games  would substantially reduce the revenue earned at these locations 
however  our fixed rent commitments on these locations would be unchanged 
as a result  the profit we earn from these facilities would decrease significantly 
the declaration of war in the middle east  or related terrorist activity  could affect demand for parking consumer confidence may be affected by the declaration of war in the middle east 
a loss of confidence may lead to the public being less likely to incur discretionary spending on restaurants  sporting events and theatres  which in turn means less demand and lower revenues at adjacent parking facilities 
furthermore  the threat of  or actual  terrorist activity in urban centres in north america may lead to restrictions on access to streets or buildings in the downtown areas 
this may result in the access to parking facilities being more difficult  or not permitted at all  which will have an adverse effect on revenue generated from those facilities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk to december   we have not entered into significant derivative instruments either for hedging or speculative purposes 
as of december   we had no such instruments outstanding 
we will periodically hold excess available cash in cash equivalents which are short term deposits at major financial institutions with terms to maturity at the date of acquisition of three months or less 
interest rates our primary exposure to market risk consists of changes in interest rates on cash invested in short term deposits which are all included in cash equivalents on our consolidated balance sheet 
as of december   we had approximately million invested in short term deposits  earning approximately in interest 
changes in interest rates could impact our anticipated real rate of return 
however  due to the short term nature of such investments  the risk of loss to market is not expected to be significant 
our bank indebtedness of million at december  bears interest at rates which vary with changes in the london interbank offered rate libor 
based on our current borrowing level  a change in libor would impact net income by less than million annually 
foreign currency exposure we operate wholly owned subsidiaries in canada 
total revenues excluding reimbursement of management contract expenses from canadian operations amounted to million for the year ended december  as detailed in note to the financial statements 
we intend to continue to invest in canadian facilities  and may identify expansion opportunities in other foreign countries 
we believe that our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is limited because our canadian dollar revenues have to date been significantly offset by canadian dollar operating costs 
our net earnings in canada for were approximately million  or approximately c million translated at the average exchange rate for of us c 
if the exchange rate used in had been c instead of c  the effect would be to reduce our net earnings by approximately million 
presently  we have no formal hedging programs  other than investing any excess canadian cash in us treasury bills 
we would consider implementing a hedging program if such risk materially increases
