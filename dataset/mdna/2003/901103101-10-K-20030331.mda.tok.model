industry background continued growth in residential and commercial demand for broadband services in recent years  there has been a dramatic increase in demand by businesses and consumers for high speed data access to the internet and to private corporate networks 
this demand is being driven by the growth in the number of users who are accessing networks for a variety of applications  including communications via the internet and corporate intranets  electronic commerce  and telecommuting 
as an example of the growth in high speed access  research carried out by london based industry analyst point topic estimates that the worldwide installed base of dsl lines almost doubled in  from million to million lines 
in addition to an increasing demand for broadband data services  there has been substantial consumer demand for advanced digital based television services that until recently could only be delivered over broadband fiber  coaxial cable  or satellite facilities 
as an example of growth in demand for advanced television services  satellite delivered digital television to us households has risen dramatically over the last seven years from under million subscribers to over million subscribers at the end of worldwide telecommunications deregulation and new technology spawns competition for bundled services an open regulatory framework for telecommunication telecom services and advances in broadband technology have led to cable television companies offering voice services and hsia services to their traditional base of cable tv subscribers 
by bundling multiple voice  video  and data services into a single service package  cable based multi system operators msos reduce their infrastructure  marketing and sales cost per revenue dollar and increase their customer retention rate while increasing revenue from these customers in absolute terms 
msos success in gaining 
table of contents new telephone customers at the expense of the ilecs has been dramatic  with subscription rates in certain united states regions exceeding of local residential telephone subscribers 
the success of the msos is creating increasing pressure on the ilecs to offer similar bundled packages of voice  data  and video services 
with continuing advances in dsl video compression technologies  a competitive service package  including digital broadcast video  can be delivered over the ilecs embedded base of telephone lines 
if the ilecs do not respond to these mso offerings with similarly competitive offerings  they may be left with an underutilized and expensive network as their voice and data customers migrate to competitive offerings 
smaller rural iocs in the united states are already achieving success with bundled voice data video offerings by providing broadcast tv service using mpeg over asynchronous dsl adsl and very high speed dsl vdsl 
with higher speed adsl standards now in place and lower bit rate mpeg compression technologies being introduced to the market  it will soon be possible to deliver three channels of video plus hsia service plus normal telephone service over a single telephone line 
these technological advancements  plus the competitive threat from the msos  could lead the larger ilec carriers and ptts into also offering bundled services 
characteristics of the market for digital tv head ends among telecommunication companies digital tv head ends dhes are deployed in metropolitan areas to a receive both national broadcast tv channels via satellite and local tv channels via off air antennas and b to process these signals for carriage over fiber  coaxial  and or copper network facilities 
the total dhe market tends to be fragmented into two sub markets a head end market for cable based msos using statistical multiplexing and quadrature amplitude modulation qam over hybrid fiber coax hfc networks  and a head end market for telecommunication companies telcos using constant bit rate cbr multiplexing and ip or atm protocols over fiber and copper networks 
there are rural telcos that use both cable and copper networks for their tv services and these telcos might use a combination of head end products 
for the telco head end market  a basic head end requirement is to provide high quality digital encoding of local analog tv signals and digital turnaround of satellite tv signals 
digital turnaround content processing takes variable bit rate signals as input and turns them around into constant bit rate ip or atm streams for subsequent delivery over adsl or vdsl access networks 
since most of the tv channels in any service bundle are national in scope  certain telco head end customers are deploying a major head end in one location  placing these national channels over a regional or statewide fiber network  and then using remote mini head ends deployed throughout the state to add local channels to the lineup as appropriate in individual towns or cities 
for telcos using adsl for video service delivery  a key dhe requirement is for low bit rate encoding and digital turnaround to maximize the available market 
in other words  today s adsl systems can deliver service speeds of up to mbps  but only for customers that are within  to  feet of the dslam or digital loop carrier dlc that is providing the adsl service 
a service speed of mbps is enough to provide tv channels at mbps each plus a mbps hsia channel 
if the video encoding rate could be dropped to mbps  then mbps of adsl speed would be sufficient and customers as far as  to  feet from the dslam dlc could receive service 
thus  the lower bit rate signals available through advanced video encoding techniques will greatly expand the market reach of an adsl based video service 
video trunking market characteristics the video trunking market is characterized by the need to deliver a small number of private or public video signals over a private broadband network or privately leased facility 
the particular video source may be a signal from a local tv station that needs to be brought back to a regional or statewide dhe that is miles away 
the video source may be a signal received from an outdoor surveillance camera that needs to reach a decoder or personal computer pc for viewing hundreds of miles away  or the video source may be a signal from a university seminar that needs to feed remote classroom sites 

table of contents the video trunking market is characterized by tradeoffs between the cost of long distance broadband facilities and the cost of low bit rate encoders to reduce the need for bandwidth 
as advanced video encoding techniques find their way into products and lower the need for bandwidth  this market will also expand 
private broadband network market characteristics the market for our broadband data systems is characterized by the need to transport high speed data signals across private buildings or campus locations in which the only available transmission facility is composed of ordinary telephone wires 
applications within this market include the need to connect hotel guests to hsia service over the hotel s telephone wires  the need to connect video surveillance cameras  back office pcs  and ticket machines found across a railroad station to a backbone network  and the need to connect two local area networks lans across a business campus without having to run new wires or cables 
the customers for our broadband data products include end users such as universities and commercial enterprises  regional system integrators who often bundle our products with other products for a complete turnkey solution  and regional competitive carriers who use our products to offer hsia services to hotel guests and or apartment tenants 
the tut systems solution set we design  develop  and sell video content processing systems optimized for the provisioning of public broadcast digital tv services across telephone company and cable company facilities  video trunking digital video applications across tv broadcast  government and education facilities  and broadband data transmission systems for application over existing private campus or building facilities 
we use our technical strengths  skills  and experience in video based applications to develop highly reliable  high performance systems for processing and converting either analog video or pre encoded digital video signals into the proper format for transmission over fiber  coaxial cable  or copper facilities 
the format of the output signals from our systems varies according to application and can be either mpeg and mpeg format in either ip  atm  ip over atm  or digital video broadcasting asynchronous serial interface dvb asi protocols over copper  fiber or coaxial interfaces 
our video systems are designed to international standards to facilitate interoperation with companion systems and software from third party vendors to form a complete end to end system for the customer 
for some customers  we provide systems integration services to our customers to ensure that the entire video system  including third party satellite antennas  set top boxes  and operational software  works seamlessly together 
our broadband data products provide our customers with reliable  high performance  cost effective broadband transport and with enhanced capabilities such as subscriber management  bandwidth management  plug and play installation  portal redirection  ip address management  service authorization and network address translation 
our products are designed with the specific requirements of the target market in mind and provide the following benefits to our customers video content processing systems astria content processor cp our astria cp is a third generation  chassis based platform that has been purposefully designed for the digital tv marketplace 
the astria cp uses patent pending qualview tm applications to deliver high quality video when converting satellite based variable bit rate video and audio to groomed cbr content for delivery over access networks 
this qualview digital turnaround dta application  coupled with astria based mpeg encoding and network protocol processing  offers service providers a robust platform that adapts all digital head end video and audio content for distribution over a variety of access networks 

table of contents the astria cp platform can process up to video and audio channels per chassis  depending on the type of processing required 
the platform integrates with ip  atm  ip over atm  or dvb asi networks providing ultimate flexibility when designing a commercial video delivery system 
astria cp is populated with flexible quad stream processor qsp modules that can be configured and reconfigured with a simple software download to enable a variety of video processing functions 
for example  on a digital turnaround application one qsp can be utilized to de multiplex a multi program transport stream mpts from a satellite 
the de multiplexed channel or single program transport stream spts can then be routed to another qsp for bit rate reduction that is required for transport over a dsl access network 
each astria qsp module contains separately configurable qsps and each astria cp chassis supports up to modules for a total possible qsp count of per chassis 
in many cases  the astria cp enables dhe systems to be deployed without the need to decode the received digital satellite signals to analog baseband signals 
this ability reduces the amount of equipment required in the head end  as well as the likelihood of inducing noise into the video and audio streams 
in addition  bit rate reduction can be done while maintaining video quality using qualview applications running on the qsps 
these applications contain sophisticated algorithms that are specifically designed to make intelligent use of the uplink encoding decisions that were imposed on the original content before it was transmitted over the satellite link 
today the astria cp outputs content in standard mpeg or mpeg formats 
we are developing software to allow astria cp to encode and transcode content into mpeg and windows media formats 
transcoding will enable mpeg input streams that may be received from a satellite link to be transcoded into either mpeg or windows media formats 
this will enable head ends to deliver mpeg ans mpeg signals simultaneously to subscriber set top boxes 
this capability will enable head end providers to reach the next stage in bit rate reduction without having to hardware upgrade their complete head end  thus preserving the customer s original investment 
in the future it will also allow video streams to be easily viewed from the large base of pcs running windows media or mpeg players 
it will also enable service providers to take advantage of the content bundling features in mpeg to insert local and or personalized content directly into particular video streams 
astria remote content processor rcp for service providers delivering digital tv over regional or statewide backbone networks  our astria rcp provides an affordable way to distribute video signals sourced from a single digital head end 
the astria rcp accepts pre processed mpeg video from a centralized astria cp via atm or ethernet fiber networks rings or point to point links and performs appropriate protocol conversion for delivery of the video streams over a variety of access platforms  including adsl  vdsl  cable tv catv and ftth 
this flexibility allows service providers to place astria rcps at the edge of a fiber optic transport network and deliver aggregated  and localized content enabling customization of a channel line up to a specific region or community 
the ability to add drop channels into the line up at the edge of the transport network allows service providers to incorporate local programming  advertising  and emergency alert system eas content 
this creates a complete mix of content that is relevant to local subscribers 
astria video services switch vss our astria vss that is under development is intended to provide video service management  multi tier ip multicasting  and dslam aggregation capabilities to support cost effective delivery of advanced video services in a common format across a variety of embedded and emerging access networks

vtc s first commercially deployed digital head end was at chibardun telephone cooperative in dallas  wisconsin in in  telenor as  norway s largest telecommunications provider  with more than million customers  launched digital tv services over its adsl and vdsl networks using an astria cp 
we expect the small to medium size iocs in the united states to remain the primary near term market for astria products as the larger ilecs and ptts continue to investigate the market for dsl based video services 
system integrators we market our private broadband data systems to domestic and international system integrators who in turn market and sell our products to educational and government institutions  to small to large commercial enterprises  and to regional competitive service providers and national carriers 
our systems integrators range from small local companies to volume distributors such as ingram micro  to country specific integrators such as rikei in japan  and to international integrators such as enterasys and siemens in europe 
marketing  sales and customer support marketing we seek to increase demand for our products and to expand both the visibility of the company and our products in the market 
in addition to customer specific sales efforts  our marketing activities include attendance at major industry tradeshows and conferences  the distribution of sales and product literature  operation of a web site  direct marketing and ongoing communications with our customers  the press  and industry analysts 
as appropriate  we enter into cooperative marketing and or development agreements with strategic partners that may include key customers  semiconductor manufacturers  radio  fiber  or video equipment manufacturers  set top box manufacturers  and others 
sales we sell our products through multiple sales channels in the united states  including a select group of regional value added resellers  system integrators and distributors  data networking catalogs and directly to service providers 
internationally  we sell and market our products through sales agents  systems integrators and distributors 
in  we opened a sales office in the united kingdom  and  with the acquisition of videotele 
com  we now have a sales presence in china 
for the year ended december   we derived approximately of our revenue from customers outside of the united states 
we believe that our products can serve a substantial market for digital video and high speed data access products outside of the united states 
customer support we believe that consistent high quality service and support is a key factor in attracting and retaining customers 
service and technical support of our products is coordinated by our customer support organization 
our systems application engineers  located in each of our sales regions  support pre sales and post sales activities 
customers can also access technical information and receive technical support via our web site 

table of contents research and development our research and development efforts are focused on enhancing our existing products and developing new products through our emphasis on early stage system engineering 
the product development process begins with a comprehensive functional product specification based on input from the sales and marketing organizations 
we incorporate feedback from end users and distribution channels  and through participation in industry events  industry organizations and standards development bodies  such as the fs vdsl committee and mpeg industry forum 
key elements of our research and development strategy include core designs 
we seek to develop and or acquire platform architectures and core designs that allow for cost effective deployment and flexible upgrades that meet the needs of multiple markets and applications 
these designs emphasize quick time to market and future cost reduction potential 
the astria  expresso gs mdu and intellipop platforms are a direct result of this strategy 
product line extensions 
we seek to extend our existing product lines through product modifications and enhancements in order to meet the needs of particular customers and markets 
products resulting from our product line extension efforts include the astria rcp and the m use of industry standard components 
our design philosophy emphasizes the use of industry standard hardware and software components whenever possible to reduce time to market  decrease the cost of goods and reduce the risks inherent in new design 
we maximize the use of third party software for operating systems and certain protocol stacks  which allows our software engineers to concentrate on hardware specific drivers  user interface software and advanced features 
new technologies 
we seek to enhance our product lines by incorporating emerging technologies  such as mpeg  higher speed fiber interfaces and new network management software features 
our astria vss system utilizes certain technology obtained from our viagate technologies  inc viagate acquisition  and our intellipop suite of products is designed to utilize technology from our vintel communications  inc vintel and xstreamis limited xstreamis acquisitions 
additionally  our active involvement in industry based standards associations  such as the mpeg standards body and the full service vdsl committee  enables us to incorporate recommended platform architectures and standards into our technology 
as a result of our acquisition of vtc  we have curtailed developments directly related to vdsl line technologies while initiating new development efforts related to video compression technologies 
expenditures for research and development in fiscal were  compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal we anticipate that we will continue to have significant research and development expenditures in the future to provide a continuing flow of innovative  high quality products to enhance our competitive position 
manufacturing we do not manufacture any of our own products 
we rely on contract manufacturers to assemble  test and package our products 
we require international organization for standardization iso registration for these contract manufacturers as a condition of qualification 
we monitor each contractor s manufacturing process performance through audits  testing and inspections 
each contractor s quality is also rigorously assessed through incoming testing and inspection of packaged products received from each contractor 
in addition  we monitor the reliability of our products through in house repair  reliability audit testing and field data analysis 
we currently purchase a substantial portion of the raw materials and components used in our products through contract manufacturers 
we forecast our product requirements to maintain sufficient product inventory to ensure that we can meet the required delivery times demanded by our customers 
our future success will depend in significant part on our ability to obtain manufacturing on time  at low costs and in sufficient quantities to meet demand 

table of contents competition within our traditional market for private broadband products  intense price competition in certain areas of the asia pacific has decreased our market opportunity significantly in these areas 
our sales declines in the north american market for private broadband data systems have less to do with competition and more to do with the deteriorating economics of the clec market  which has reduced customer demand from this segment of the market 
to maintain a competitive position in our traditional market  we have focused our product efforts on cost reduction  feature enhancements for particular vertical markets  and working with large  established systems integrators in europe 
the service provider market for video systems  represented by the incumbent carriers  is characterized by small iocs that tend to readily adopt new technologies and enter new markets  and the larger incumbents  such as the rbocs and ptts  that take longer to make decisions and deploy new technology and services 
both markets are equally competitive with many of the competitive factors influencing procurement decisions external to the technology and outside of our control  such as competition against large multinational suppliers who have both a track record and a large embedded base of ancillary technology  incumbent carriers desire to try to make embedded systems meet demand for new services through future enhancements or upgrades rather than deploying new systems  long evaluation cycles and expensive third party testing requirements for new technology  and lack of certainty regarding certain regulatory schemes that impact our markets  which create a potential roadblock to rapid technology adoption 
in order to continue to be competitive in service provider markets  we believe that our company must continue to adhere to the following principles conform our products to industry standards wherever possible  offer a sufficient breadth of product lines to address the needs of the market  continue to incorporate additional product features and enhancements in our products  including improvements in product performance  reliability  size  and scalability  continue to design and manufacture our products with a focus on low cost and ease of deployment and use  continue to increase the effectiveness of our sales and distribution capability  continue to provide technical support  and respond quickly to service and general industry and economic conditions 
although we believe that we currently compete favorably with respect to all of these factors  there can be no assurance that we will have the financial resources  technical expertise or marketing  manufacturing  distribution and support capabilities to compete successfully in the future 
we expect that competition in each of our markets will increase in the future 
many of our competitors are private companies that are focused on a more narrow product line than ours and thereby may be able to devote substantially more targeted resources to developing and marketing new products than we can 
in addition  these companies may become targets for acquisition by larger companies  in which case we would face competitors that would have substantially greater name recognition and technical  financial and marketing resources than we do 
such competitors may undertake more extensive marketing campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote substantially more resources to developing new products than we can 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures that we face will not harm our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents backlog as a result of our november acquisition of vtc  we acquired business and product lines with which we historically have little management  sales and operational experience 
in addition  as with purchase orders for our legacy products  all open purchase orders for vtc products are cancelable by the customers at any time until delivery of the product to and acceptance of the product by the customer 
therefore  while we currently have backlog of our products  we do not believe that product backlog provides a meaningful indicator of future sales trends and is not material to an understanding of our overall business 
proprietary rights our success and ability to compete depends in part upon on proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright and trade secret laws and non disclosure agreements to protect our proprietary technology 
we currently hold united states patents and have united states patent applications pending 
furthermore  as a result of our acquisition of vtc  we have gained access to all pertinent video based patents held by tektronix as of the date of acquisition 
there can be no assurance that patents will be issued with respect to pending or future patent applications or that our patents will be upheld as valid or will prevent the development of competitive products 
we seek to protect our intellectual property rights by limiting access to the distribution of our software  documentation and other proprietary information 
in addition  we enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and certain customers  vendors and strategic partners 
the steps we take in this regard may be inadequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology  and our competitors may independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technologies 
we are also subject to the risk of adverse claims and litigation alleging infringement of the intellectual property rights of others 
in this regard  there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims in the future with respect to our current or future products or that such claims will not require us to enter into license arrangements or result in protracted and costly litigation  regardless of the merits of those claims 
no assurance can be given that any necessary licenses will be available or that  if available  these licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms

overview we design  develop  and sell video content processing systems optimized for the provisioning of public broadcast digital tv services across telephone company and cable company facilities  digital video trunking systems for applications across tv broadcast  government and education facilities  and broadband data transmission systems for application over existing private campus or building facilities 
historically  most of our sales were derived from our broadband data transmission systems 
with our november acquisition of video tele 
com vtc  formerly a subsidiary of tektronix  inc  we extended our product offerings to include video content processing and video trunking systems 
the acquisition of vtc has resulted in a significant change in the structure  organization and priorities of tut  including changes in our 
table of contents organizational structure and employee staffing  establishment of significant operations in lake oswego  oregon  at the prior headquarters location of vtc  the designation of douglas shafer  the former president and chief executive officer of vtc  as vice president  finance and administration  chief financial officer and secretary of tut systems  an expansion of sales and marketing efforts to include vtc products  and a reprioritization of tut systems research and development budget to include the research and development of products acquired by tut in its acquisition of vtc 
during and  we reduced the sales prices of some of our products to remain competitive and to reduce our high levels of inventory 
although we have historically been able to offset most price declines with reductions in our manufacturing costs  there can be no assurance that we will be able to offset further price declines with additional cost reductions 
also  market developments  including the write down of significant amounts of inventory by competitors and products resold as a result of bankruptcies within the industry  have put increased pressure on the sales prices of our existing inventories 
in addition  some of our licensees may sell products based on our technology to our competitors or potential competitors 
sales to customers outside of the united states accounted for approximately  and of revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
on average  we expect international sales to represent less than of our revenue 
however  actual results  both geographically and in absolute dollars  may vary from quarter to quarter depending on the timing of orders placed by customers 
to date  all international sales have been primarily denominated in us dollars 
we expect to continue to evaluate product line expansion and new product opportunities  engage in research  development and engineering activities and focus on cost effective design of our products 
accordingly  we will continue to make significant expenditures on research and development activities as a percentage of overall operating expenses

vtc offers digital head end solutions enabling home entertainment delivery via the broadband internet 
in connection with our acquisition of vtc  we are contractually obligated to use our commercially reasonable efforts to register on a form s pursuant to rule a i under the securities act of  as amended  on a continuous or delayed offering the million shares of common stock issued to tektronix no later than may  in order that tektronix may sell such shares on or after december  while we expect to derive benefits from sales of product lines that are designed  developed and marketed as a result of these acquisitions  there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete the development and commercial deployment of certain of these products 
in january  we decided to abandon future sales of the existing onegate product that we acquired in the freegate acquisition 
in april  as part of our cost reduction efforts  we decided not to pursue further incorporation of the related onegate and other intellectual property acquired from freegate into the design of future products 
as a result  we took a write down of million for abandonment of the related completed technology and patents in the first quarter of during our impairment review for the third quarter of  we evaluated the present value of future expected cash flows to determine the fair value of our long lived assets 
this evaluation resulted in a write down of million of goodwill and other intangible assets 
the underlying factors contributing to the decline in expected future cash flows include a continued decline in the telecommunications industry and the indefinite postponement of capital expenditures  especially within the hospitality industry

following our acquisition of vtc in november  we also generated million in revenues from turnkey solutions  which are comprised of the sale of digital head end and video trunking equipment 
our total revenue decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  and from million for the year ended december  using a year over year comparison  the decrease in compared to of million  or  was primarily due to decreased sales of our expresso mdu products 
the market for our products was significantly weaker in than it was in because our customers continued to delay or forego capital expenditures for products such as ours 
the decrease in compared to of million  or  was also primarily due to a significant decrease in sales of our expresso mdu products 
during the fourth quarter of  our revenue growth slowed substantially due to i several key customers who  in the latter part of the fourth quarter of  experienced a rapid deterioration in their ability to obtain additional capital and  as a result  severely curtailed or halted their purchases of our product  and ii reduced sales volume in the korean market 
the fourth quarter of revenue declines resulted in fourth quarter revenues of million compared with revenues of million for the first three quarters of in aggregate 
these developments were not unique to us and have continued in conjunction with a general and protracted downturn in the telecommunications market throughout and  affecting our ability to generate comparatively similar levels of sales 
in certain instances  these developments made collection of receivables less certain and required us to defer revenue until cash was collected 
during the third quarter of  our revenue growth further slowed due to an increase in the number of customers and potential customers  particularly within the hospitality industry  that indefinitely postponed capital expenditures after the events surrounding september  and in reaction to continued weak demand from their own end customers 
license and royalty revenue decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  and from million for the year ended december  the 
table of contents slight decrease in compared to of million  or  and the decrease in compared to of million  or  were primarily due to decreases in royalty payments on license agreements

the decrease in compared to of was due primarily to significant sales volume decreases on our expresso mdu products in when compared to during  we recorded reserves for excess and obsolete inventory totaling million 
these reserves were primarily related to the costs of raw materials and finished goods in excess of what we reasonably expected to sell in the foreseeable future  based on the continued decline in the telecommunications market and current economic conditions 
during  we recorded reserves for excess and obsolete inventory totaling million 
million of these reserves were primarily related to the costs of raw materials and finished goods in excess of what we reasonably expected to sell in the foreseeable future 
market developments over the past two years  including the write down of significant amounts of inventory by competitors  the proliferation of products resold as a result of bankruptcies within the industry  continued slowdown in the telecommunications market and more recently  the indefinite postponement of capital expenditures  especially within the hospitality industry  have contributed to substantial uncertainties related to the value of these inventories 
during  we also recorded additional reserves of million for excess and obsolete inventory as a part of our normal business operations and product inventory assessments 
during the fourth quarter of  we recognized a charge related to provision for loss on purchase commitments and abandoned product lines of million 
this provision covered estimated costs for the cancellation of inventory purchase commitments that resulted from industry slow downs of large scale deployments in the mtu market and actual costs of inventory of abandoned product lines no longer deemed essential to our core technologies in the future 
the cost of these abandoned products was million and included onegate products  certain expresso gs line cards and routers  and certain subscriber management software 
during  we reversed million of the provision for loss on purchase commitments against cost of goods sold and we paid our suppliers million upon receipt of raw material components related to our provision of loss on purchase commitments recorded in the fourth quarter of at december   these components were included in inventory offset by the provision for million 
there were no additional provisions recorded in related to these raw material components 
in  cost of goods sold also included approximately million for the sale of raw materials previously reserved through the loss on purchase

in november  we announced a restructuring program that included a workforce reduction  the termination of our pleasanton  california headquarters facility lease and disposal of certain fixed assets 
as a result of this restructuring program  we recorded restructuring costs of million  comprising severance and outplacement expenses of approximately million  costs to terminate the pleasanton  california facility lease of million  million for abandonment of leasehold improvements  million for abandonment of fixed assets and million to terminate various equipment leases 
as of december   we had a remaining restructuring accrual of million related to costs to terminate various equipment leases and severance payments  which was paid in the first quarter of the workforce reduction as a result of fiscal restructurings was approximately

impairment of intangibles and goodwill 
based on the impairment review performed during the third quarter of  we recorded a million impairment charge to write off all of the remaining goodwill and assembled workforce and reduce the book value of our completed technology and patents 
the charge was determined based upon estimated discounted future cash flows using a discount rate of 
the assumptions supporting future cash flows  including the discount rate  were determined using management s best estimates 
the underlying factors contributing to the decline in expected future cash flows include a continued slowdown in the telecommunications market  and the indefinite postponement of capital expenditures  particularly within the hospitality industry 
in the first quarter of  we recorded a million impairment charge to write off the completed technology and patents of freegate 
this resulted from our decision not to pursue further incorporation of the related onegate product and other intellectual property acquired from freegate into the design of future products 
total impairment of intangibles and goodwill was million for the year ended december  there were no such impairments for the years ended december  and as of december   our net intangible assets remaining to be amortized were million  comprised of completed technology and patents related to the acquisitions of the viagate assets  xstreamis and vtc and contract backlog  customer list  maintenance contract renewals and trademarks related to the acquisition of vtc

impairment of certain equity investments 
impairment of certain equity investments consisted of the recognition of expense related to the write off of million invested in three privately held companies during the year ended december  and million invested in one privately held company during the year ended december  the value of these investments was impaired due to uncertainty associated with the on going viability of each of these businesses in the current network infrastructure industry 
there was no such impairment of our equity investments for the year ended december  interest and other income  net

our interest and other income  net decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the decrease in compared to of million  or  was primarily due to lower interest rates on lower average cash balances 
the decrease in compared to of million  or  was also primarily due to lower interest rates on lower average cash and investment balances 
the decrease was offset by a gain in on a settlement with one of our suppliers of million 
liquidity and capital resources historically  our principal source of liquidity has been through equity funding 
from our inception through january  we financed our operations primarily through the sale of preferred equity securities for an aggregate of million net of offering costs

in future periods  we generally anticipate a decrease in working capital expenditures on a period to period basis primarily as a result of completing a substantial portion of payments for purchase commitments for inventory and decreases in our operational costs due to our workforce reductions 
we have entered into certain contractual obligations and other purchase commitments that could result in cash outflows 
at december   the remaining accrual for purchase commitments of raw material components was million  which is to be paid in two equal installments in the first and second quarters of the first installment was paid in january our future minimum lease payments under operating leases at december  are as follows year in millions thereafter we have incurred substantial losses and negative cash flows from operations since inception 
for the year ended december   we incurred a net loss of million  negative cash flows from operations of million  and have an accumulated deficit of million 
management believes that the cash and cash equivalents as of december  are sufficient to fund its operating activities and capital expenditure needs for the next twelve months 
management expects the amount of cash used to fund operations to decrease in however  to the extent our business continues to be affected by poor economic conditions impacting the telecommunications industry  we will continue to require cash to fund operations 
we will seek additional funding for operations from alternative debt and equity sources  if necessary  to maintain reasonable operating levels 
we cannot assure that such funding efforts will be successful 
failure to generate positive cash flow in the future could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our intended business objectives 
option exchange program on may   we made an offer to exchange all stock options outstanding under our stock plan  stock plan and the nonstatutory stock option plan to purchase shares of our common stock held by eligible employees for new stock options that were to be granted under our stock plan or our nonstatutory stock option plan  upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the offer to exchange 
an eligible employee refers to all employees of tut systems  inc and its us subsidiaries who were employees at the time the new stock options were granted  other than all executive officers  vice presidents  members of the board of directors and employees receiving workers adjustment and retraining notification act pay  all of whom were not eligible to participate in the offer 
the number of shares of common stock subject to the new stock options is equal to the number of shares of common stock subject to the unexercised stock options tendered by such eligible employees and accepted for exchange and cancelled 
the new stock options were issued on december   a date that was at least six months and two days later than the date of 
table of contents cancellation 
this stock option exchange program required the filing of a tender offer statement 
employees receiving such an offer were requested to read our form q for the quarter ended march   a related offering memorandum and other pertinent information before making a decision with respect to the offer 
accounting and other regulatory concerns prevented or limited our ability to issue additional stock options to these employees during the period between cancellation and reissuance 
the offer expired on june  pursuant to the offer  we accepted  for cancellation  stock options to purchase approximately  shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of 
subject to the terms and conditions of the offer  on december   we granted new stock options to purchase a total of  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of to those employees who were employed by us at that time who had tendered stock options in response to the offer that were accepted for exchange and cancelled 
there was no compensation charge associated with the offer 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
revenue recognition we generate revenue primarily from the sale of hardware products including third party products  through professional services  the licensing of our homerun technology  and the sale of our software products 
we sell products through direct sales channels and through distributors 
product revenues we recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made in connection with the measurement of revenue in a given period 
we follow specific and detailed guidelines for determining the timing of revenue recognition 
at the time of the transaction  we assess a number of factors including specific contract and purchase order terms  completion and timing of delivery to the common carrier  past transaction history with the customer  the creditworthiness of the customer  evidence of sell through to the end user  and current payment terms 
based on the results of the assessment  we may recognize revenue when the products are shipped or defer recognition until evidence of sell through occurs and cash is received 
revenue from service obligations included in product revenues is deferred and recognized ratably over the period of the obligation 
we also maintain accruals and allowances for all cooperative marketing and other programs 
estimated sales returns and warranty costs are based on historical experience and are recorded at the time revenue is recognized 
our products generally carry a one year warranty from the date of purchase 

table of contents turnkey solution revenues revenue from turnkey solution sales is generally recognized using the percentage of completion method 
under the percentage of completion method  revenue recognized reflects the portion of the anticipated contract revenue that has been earned  equal to the ratio of labor costs expended to date to anticipated final labor costs  based on current estimates of labor costs to complete the project 
generally  the terms of turnkey solution sales provide for billing for products at the time of delivery and for services at the time of substantial completion of the project 
license and royalty revenues license and royalty revenue consists of nonrefundable up front license fees  some of which may offset initial royalty payments  and royalties received by us for products sold by our licensees 
currently  the majority of our license and royalty revenue is comprised of non refundable license fees paid in advance 
such revenue is recognized ratably over the period during which post contract customer support is expected to be provided or upon delivery and transfer of agreed upon technical specifications in contracts where essentially no further support obligations exist 
future license and royalty revenue is expected to consist primarily of royalties received by us for products sold by our licensees 
we do not expect that such license and royalty revenue will constitute a substantial portion of our revenue in future periods 
software license and post contract support revenues regarding our intellipop product line  we expect that revenue from the sale of software products and maintenance fees may constitute a portion of revenue in future periods 
currently  our software revenue is derived from two separate sources  software license fees and post contract maintenance and support fees 
the software license fee typically grants a perpetual license to the customer 
we generally recognize revenue from the sale of the software license when all criteria for revenue recognition have been met similar to our hardware product sales 
the revenue for maintenance and support fees is recognized ratably over the term of the separate support contract 
should changes in conditions cause us to determine that the criteria for revenue recognition are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognition for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is computed using standard cost  which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis 
we record provisions to write down our inventory and related purchase commitments for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about the future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than we estimate  additional inventory provisions may be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make payments 
these estimated allowances are periodically reviewed  analyzing the customers payment history and information regarding the customers creditworthiness known to us 
if the financial condition of any of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  an additional allowance would be required 
accounting for long lived assets we assess the impairment of long lived assets and related goodwill periodically 
an impairment review is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 

table of contents factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  a significant decline in the stock price for a sustained period  and the market capitalization relative to net book value 
when our management determines that the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  any impairment measured is based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
during  we determined that certain intangible long lived assets were impaired and recorded losses accordingly under sfas no 
no such impairment was recorded in future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators once again exist 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings as discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements 
because of uncertainties related to both the potential amount and range of loss from the pending litigation  management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result if there is an unfavorable outcome to these legal proceedings 
as additional information becomes available  we will assess the potential liability related to this pending litigation and revise our estimates accordingly 
revisions of our estimates of such potential liability could materially impact our results of operations  financial condition or cashflows 
stock based compensation our stock based employee compensation plans are described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements equity benefit plans 
we account for those plans under the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
and related interpretations 
unearned stock based employee compensation cost is reflected in net income  as some options granted under those plans had an exercise price less than the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant  which is described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements equity benefit plans 
we amortize stock based compensation using the straight line method over the remaining vesting periods of the related options  which is generally four years 
pro forma information regarding net loss and earnings per share is required 
this information is required to be determined as if we had accounted for employee stock options under the fair value method of sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 

table of contents the following table illustrates the effect on net loss and earnings per share if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 to stock based employee compensation year ended december  net loss as reported add unearned stock based employee compensation expense included in reported net loss deduct total stock based employee compensation expense determined under a fair value based method for all grants  net of related tax effects net loss pro forma basic and diluted net loss per share as reported basic and diluted net loss per share pro forma the fair value of options and shares issued pursuant to the option plans and at the grant date were estimated using the black scholes model 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
in addition  option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility 
we use projected volatility rates  which are based upon historical volatility rates trended into future years 
because our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  in management s opinion  the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our options 
the effects of applying pro forma disclosures of net loss and earnings per share are not likely to be representative of the pro forma effects on net loss income and earnings per share in the future years  as the number of future shares to be issued under these plans is not known and the assumptions used to determine the fair value can vary significantly

table of contents additional risk factors that could affect our operating results and the market price of our stock we have a history of losses and expect to continue to incur losses in the future 
we have incurred substantial net losses and experienced negative cash flow for each quarter since our inception 
we incurred net losses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect that we will continue to incur losses into fiscal year we may never achieve profitability and  if we do so  we may not be able to maintain profitability 
we have spent substantial amounts of money on the development of our expresso products  homerun and longrun technology  intellipop products and software products 
in november  we acquired videotele 
com and certain products of videotele 
com that we anticipate will bring us incremental revenue beyond our expresso  home run  long run and intellipop products 
during fiscal and  we significantly reduced our workforce in an effort to decrease certain of our operating expenditures  including our sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative expenditures 
however  we may not be able to generate a sufficient level of revenue even with our newly acquired videotele 
com products to offset our current level of expenditures 
additionally  we may be unable to adjust our spending in a timely manner to respond to any unanticipated decline in revenue due to the fact that our expenditures for sales and marketing  research and development  and general and administrative functions are relatively fixed in the short term 
our ability to achieve and maintain profitability in the future will primarily depend on our ability to do the following increase the level of sales of our expresso products  including existing expresso inventories  increase our sales of videotele 
com products  successfully penetrate new markets for our intellipop products  reduce manufacturing costs  reduce operating expense as a percentage of sales  sell excess component parts obtained as a result of canceled purchase commitments  and successfully introduce and sell enhanced versions of our existing and new products 
our operating results may fluctuate significantly  which could cause our stock price to decline 
a number of factors could cause our quarterly and annual financial results to be worse than expected  which could result in a decline in our stock price 
our annual and quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of numerous factors  some of which are outside of our control 
these factors include availability of capital in the network infrastructure industry  management of inventory levels  market acceptance of our products  competitive pressures  including pricing pressures from our partners and competitors  particularly in light of continued announcements from competitors in recent quarters that they have written down significant amounts of inventory  which could lead to a general excess of competitive products in the marketplace  the timing or cancellation of orders from  or shipments to  existing and new customers  the timing of our new product and service introductions as well as introductions by our customers  our partners or our competitors  variations in our sales or distribution channels  
table of contents variations in the mix of products that we offer  changes in the pricing policies of our suppliers  the availability and cost of key components  and the timing of personnel hiring 
we anticipate that average selling prices for our products will continue to decrease in the near future due to increased competitive price pressures in certain geographical regions 
in addition  we may also experience substantial period to period fluctuations in future operating results and declines in gross margins as a result of the erosion of average selling prices for high speed data access products and services due to a number of factors  including increased competition and rapid technological change 
decreasing the average selling prices of our products could cause us to experience decreased revenue despite an increase in the number of units sold 
we may be unable to sustain our gross margins  even at the anticipated reduced levels  improve our gross margins by offering new products or increased product functionality or offset future price declines with proportionate reductions in our cost structure 
as a result of these and other factors  our operating results for future periods may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
in that event  the price of our common stock would further decline 
we are and continue to be affected by poor general economic conditions that have resulted in significantly reduced sales levels and  if such adverse economic conditions continue or worsen  our business  operating results and financial condition will continue to be negatively impacted 
the continued poor economic conditions in the world economy  the continued industry wide downturn in the telecommunications market and recent events in iraq have materially and adversely affected  and continue to materially and adversely affect  our sales 
as a result  we have  and will likely continue to  experience a material adverse impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
comparatively lower sales for each of our fiscal years since have resulted in operating expenses increasing as a percentage of revenue for and compared to although we took actions throughout and to create revenue opportunities and reduce operating expenses  including our acquisition of videotele 
com  a prolonged continuation or worsening of sales trends that we faced in and would force us to take additional actions and charges in order to reduce our operating expenses further 
if we are unable to reduce operating expenses at a rate and level consistent with anticipated future adverse sales trends or if we continue to incur significant special charges associated with such expense reductions that are disproportionate to our sales  our business  operating results and financial condition will be even further negatively impacted 
we depend on a limited number of large customers for a substantial portion of our revenue during any given period  and the loss of a key customer or loss or delay of a key order could substantially reduce our revenue in a given period 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue in each period from a limited number of customers 
one customer  ingram micro  accounted for of our revenue for the year ended december  two customers  kanematsu computer system ltd 
and rikei corporation  respectively accounted for and  respectively  of our revenue for the year ended december  three customers  trigemm infocomm  inc  reflex communications  inc 
and darwin networks inc  accounted for  and  respectively  of our revenue for the year ended december  prior to  many of our customers had limited or  in some cases  no access to capital and continue to experience significant financial difficulties  including bankruptcy 
in order to meet our revenue targets  we must continue to acquire new customers and increase sales to our existing customers 
in addition  our strategy of targeting larger  more established customers may result in longer sales cycles and delayed revenue 
sales to larger accounts could also result in increased competition from larger and more established competitors 
if sales to our largest customers decrease materially below current levels or if we are unable to 
table of contents establish a new base of customers  such decreases or failures would materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we have in the past and may in the future acquire companies  technologies or products  and  if we fail to integrate these acquisitions  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be harmed 
in fiscal  and  we completed four acquisitions 
as a part of our business strategy  we expect to make additional acquisitions of  or significant investments in  complementary companies  products or technologies 
we may need to overcome significant issues in order to realize any benefits from our past transactions  and any future acquisitions would be accompanied by similar risks 
these risks include  but are not limited to combining product offerings and preventing customers and distributors from deferring purchasing decisions or switching to other suppliers due to uncertainty about the direction of our product offerings and our willingness to support and service existing products  which could result in our incurring additional obligations in order to address customer uncertainty  demonstrating to customers and distributors that the transaction will not result in adverse changes in client service standards or business focus and helping customers conduct business easily  consolidating and rationalizing corporate it infrastructure  including implementing information management and system processes that enable increased customer satisfaction  improved productivity  lower costs  more direct sales and improved inventory management  consolidating administrative infrastructure and manufacturing operations and maintaining adequate controls throughout the integration  coordinating sales and marketing efforts to communicate our offerings and capabilities effectively  coordinating and rationalizing research and development activities to enhance introduction of new products and technologies with reduced cost  preserving distribution  marketing or other important relationships and resolving potential conflicts that may arise  minimizing the diversion of management attention from ongoing business concerns  persuading employees that business cultures are compatible  maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees while implementing restructuring programs  coordinating and combining operations  subsidiaries and affiliated entities  relationships and facilities  which may be subject to additional constraints imposed by local laws and regulations and may also result in contract terminations or renegotiations and labor and tax law implications  and managing integration issues shortly after or pending the completion of other independent reorganizations 
on november   we completed our acquisition of vtc  a leading provider of video content processing and video trunking  and we are in the process of integrating vtc into our company 
we evaluate and enter into other acquisition and alliance transactions on an ongoing basis 
the size and scope of the acquisition of vtc relative to our overall size increases both the scope and consequence of ongoing integration risks 
we may not successfully address the integration challenges in a timely manner  or at all  and we may not fully realize all of the anticipated benefits or synergies of the vtc acquisition which are principally associated with restructurings  including workforce reductions  procurement synergies and other operational efficiencies or of any other transaction to the extent  or in the timeframe  anticipated 
moreover  the timeframe for achieving benefits may depend partially on the actions of employees  suppliers or other third parties 
even if an acquisition or alliance is successfully integrated  we may not receive the expected benefits of the transaction 
managing acquisitions and alliances requires varying levels of management resources  which may 
table of contents divert our attention from other business operations 
the vtc acquisition also has resulted  and may in the future result  in significant costs and expenses and charges to earnings 
these costs and expenses could include those related to severance pay  asset impairment charges  charges from the elimination of duplicative facilities and contracts  in process research and development charges  inventory adjustments  legal  accounting and financial advisory fees  and required payments to executive officers and key employees under retention plans adopted in connection with the transaction 
also  any prior or future downgrades in our credit rating associated with an acquisition could adversely affect our ability to borrow and result in more restrictive borrowing terms  including increased borrowing costs  more restrictive covenants and the extension of less open credit 
this in turn could materially and adversely affect our internal cost of capital estimates and  therefore  our operational decisions 
as a result of the foregoing  any completed  pending or future transactions may contribute to financial results that differ from the investment community s expectations in a given quarter 
if we are not successful in integrating vtc into our operations in a timely manner  our business  operating results and financial condition will be materially and adversely impacted 
we are currently engaged in three securities lawsuits  two of which are class action lawsuits  any of which  if they were to result in an unfavorable resolution  could adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
beginning july   six putative stockholder class action lawsuits were filed in the united states district court for the northern district of california against us and certain of our current and former officers and directors 
the complaints were filed on behalf of a purported class of people who purchased our stock during the period between july  and january   seeking unspecified damages 
the complaints allege that we and certain of our current and former officers and directors made false and misleading statements about our business during the putative class period 
specifically  the complaints allege violations of sections b and a of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the complaints have been consolidated under the name in re tut systems  inc securities litigation  civil action no 
c jcs the securities litigation action 
lead plaintiffs and lead counsel for plaintiffs have been appointed 
plaintiffs filed a consolidated class action complaint on february  defendants filed a motion to dismiss on march  on august   the court granted in part and denied in part the motion to dismiss 
on september   the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint 
defendants filed a motion to dismiss portions of the amended complaint 
the court has not ruled on that motion 
we believe the allegations against us are without merit and intend to defend the action vigorously 
an unfavorable resolution of this litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition  or cash flows 
in march  chesky lefkowitz  a shareholder of the company  filed a derivative complaint entitled lefkowitz v 
d auria  et al  no 
rg  in the superior court of the state of california  county of alameda  against certain of the company s current and former officers and directors 
the complaint alleges causes of action for breach of fiduciary duty  gross negligence  breach of contract  unjust enrichment and improper insider stock trading  based on the same factual allegations contained in the securities litigation action 
the complaint seeks unspecified damages against the individual defendants on behalf of the company  equitable relief  and attorney s fees 
there has not been a response filed to the compliant  discovery has not commenced  and no trial date has been established 
on october   we and certain of our current and former officers and directors were named as defendants in whalen v 
tut systems  inc et al  case no 
cv  a purported securities class action lawsuit filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york 
an amended complaint was filed on december  a consolidated amended complaint was filed on april  the consolidated amended complaint asserts that the prospectuses from our january  initial public offering and our march  secondary offering failed to disclose certain alleged actions by the underwriters for the offerings 
the complaint alleges claims against us and certain of our current and former officers and directors under section of the act and under section b and rule b of the securities and exchange act of  
table of contents as amended  and alleges claims against certain of our current and former officers and directors under sections and a of the act 
the complaints also name as defendants the underwriters for our initial public offering and secondary offering 

the court has denied the company s motion to dismiss  and the case will now proceed to discovery 
we believe the allegations against us are without merit and intend to defend the action vigorously 
an unfavorable resolution of this litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition  or cash flows 
if we do not reduce our inventory  we may be forced to incur additional charges  which would further materially and adversely impact our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in fiscal years and  we accumulated a substantial inventory of finished goods and components due to poor global economic conditions and the reduction in product demand due to capital funding decreases experienced by several key customers 
since that time  we have written off a significant portion of that inventory because we have been largely unsuccessful in monetizing this inventory by selling our existing finished goods inventory and the component inventory resulting from deliveries on already canceled purchase commitments 
we expect that competitors will continue to market and sell inexpensive competitive products in the marketplace  thereby continuing to make it difficult for us to reduce our inventory levels further  which may eventually require that we write off our entire remaining  in inventory 
if we are unable to sell a substantial amount of finished goods that we have not yet written off  our expected cash position throughout will be even further materially and adversely impacted  which will harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if our expresso and intellipop products do not gain broader acceptance in the market  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be further harmed 
we launched our intellipop product series in the first half of and have not yet been successful in generating widespread customer interest in this product 
similarly  our sales of expresso units have been below what we had anticipated 
we must devote a substantial amount of human and capital resources in order to broaden commercial acceptance of our expresso products and to gain commercial acceptance of our intellipop products and expand our offerings of these products in the multi dwelling unit  or mdu  and the multi tenant commercial unit  or mcu  markets 
however  to date  this commitment of resources to these product lines has not generated the commercial acceptance that we have sought for these products 
historically  the majority of our expresso products has been sold into the mdu market 
our future success depends on our ability to continue to penetrate this market and to expand our penetration into the mcu market 
our success also depends on our ability to educate existing and potential customers and end users about the benefits of our fast copper and signature switch technologies  our longrun and intellipop products  and about the development of new products to meet changing and expanding demands of service providers  mtu owners and corporate customers  including our new product offerings based on our acquisition of videotele 
com 
the future success of our expresso and intellipop products will also depend on the ability of our service provider customers to market and sell high speed data services to end users 
if our intellipop or expresso products do not achieve broader commercial acceptance within the mdu market  mcu market  or in any other markets we may enter  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be further materially and adversely affected 
the market in which we operate is highly competitive  and we may not be able to compete effectively 
the market for video and broadband data systems is intensely competitive  and we expect that this market will continue to become more competitive in the future 
our immediate competitors include  or are expected to include  cisco systems  inc  harmonic inc  tandberg television and a number of other public and private companies 
many of these competitors offer or may in the future offer technologies and services that directly compete with some or all of our high speed access products and related software products 
also  many of these competitors continue to announce significant changes in their business plans and operations  some of which  such as major write downs of inventory  could result in lower priced products flooding the market  which would have a negative impact on our ability to sustain our current pricing and sell our inventory 
in addition  the market in 
table of contents which we compete is characterized by increasing consolidation  and we cannot predict with certainty how industry consolidation will affect us or our competitors 
our competitors and potential competitors may have substantially greater name recognition and technical  financial and marketing resources than we do  and we can give you no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively in our target markets 
these competitors may be able to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and devote substantially more resources to developing new products than we can 
in addition  our homerun licensees may sell products based on our homerun technology to our competitors or potential competitors 
this licensing may cause an erosion in the potential market for our expresso products 
we cannot assure you that we will have the financial resources  technical expertise or marketing  manufacturing  distribution and support capabilities to compete successfully 
this competition could result in price reductions  reduced profit margins and loss of market share  which could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our copper wire based solutions face severe competition from other technologies  and the commercial acceptance of any competing solutions could harm our ability to compete and thus materially and adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the market for high speed data access products and services is characterized by several competing technologies  including fiber optic cables  coaxial cables  satellites and other wireless facilities 
these competing solutions provide fast access  high reliability and cost effective solutions for some users 
many of our products are based on the use of copper telephone wire 
because there are physical limits to the speed and distance over which data can be transmitted over copper wire  our products may not be a viable solution for customers requiring service at performance levels beyond the current limits of copper telephone wire 
to the extent that telecommunications service providers choose to install fiber optic cable or other transmission media in the last mile  or to the extent that homes and businesses install other transmission media within buildings  we expect that demand for our products that are based on copper telephone wires will decline 
commercial acceptance of any one of these competing solutions or any technological advancement or product introduction that provides faster access  greater reliability  increased cost effectiveness or other advantages over technologies that utilize existing copper telephone wires could decrease the demand for our products and reduce average selling prices and gross margins associated with our products 
the occurrence of any one or more of these events could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we fail to manage our operations in light of our changing revenue base  our ability to increase our revenues and improve our results of operations could be harmed 
our operations have changed significantly due to volatility in our business 
in the past  we rapidly and significantly expanded our operations 
however  in fiscal and  we reduced our workforce significantly to control overall operating expenses in response to dramatic declines in  and the expectation of continued slowing of  our sales growth 
we anticipate that  in the future  expansion in certain areas of our business may be required to expand our customer base and exploit market opportunities 
in particular  we expect to face numerous challenges in the implementation of our business strategy to focus on selling our products to the larger  more established customers  such as ilecs and ptts  in both domestic and international markets 
to exploit the market for our products  we must develop new and enhanced products while implementing and managing effective planning and operating processes 
to manage our operations  we must  among other things  continue to implement and improve our operational  financial and management information systems  hire and train additional qualified personnel  continue to expand and upgrade core technologies and effectively manage multiple relationships with various customers  suppliers and other third parties 
we cannot assure you that our systems  procedures or controls will be adequate to support our operations or that our management will be able to achieve the rapid execution necessary to exploit fully the market for our products or systems 
if we are unable to manage our operations effectively  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 

table of contents we depend on international sales for a significant portion of our revenue  which subjects our business to a number of risks  if we are unable to generate significant international sales  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
sales to customers outside of the united states accounted for approximately  and of revenue for the years ended december  and and  respectively 
there are a number of risks arising from our international business  including  but not limited to longer receivables collection periods  increased exposure to bad debt write offs  risk of political and economic instability  difficulties in enforcing agreements through foreign legal systems  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  import or export licensing requirements  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  and currency fluctuations 
we expect sales to customers outside of the united states to continue to represent a portion of our revenue 
however  we cannot assure you that foreign markets for our products will develop at the rate or to the extent currently anticipated 
if we fail to generate significant international sales  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
our ability to attract and retain our personnel has been and may continue to be materially and adversely affected by our low stock price 
our continued low stock price means that most of our outstanding employee stock options are under water or priced substantially above the current market price of our common stock 
in response to the drop in our stock price  on may   we offered our eligible employees the opportunity to tender their existing stock options for cancellation pursuant to a stock option exchange program and have new stock options granted at a date at least six months and two days later than june   the date of cancellation 
accounting and other regulatory concerns prevented or limited our ability to issue additional stock options to these employees during the period between cancellation and the date of the new grant 
in the interim  those employees who participated in the stock option exchange offer were granted fewer or  in certain cases  were not granted stock options until december   the date that was six months and two days after the date of such cancellation 
further  employees who did not participate in the stock option exchange offer continue to hold stock options that are priced substantially above the current market price 
since that time  further declines in our stock price have meant that most of these exchanged stock options are themselves underwater 
our employees may have felt  and may continue to feel  that they are receiving inadequate compensation 
further  the continued adverse market conditions mean that our stock option offerings and our stock option plans may not offer current and potential future employees sufficient incentive to work for us 
if adverse market conditions persist  our stock option offerings and employee stock plans will further diminish our ability to attract and or retain qualified personnel  which will further materially and adversely impact our business  financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 

table of contents some of our customers have not been able to meet their financial obligations to us due to changes in the capital markets and these customers own precarious financial situations  if more of our customers experience similar financial difficulties  our revenue will decrease further  which would materially and adversely affect our business 
due to increased volatility in equity markets and tightening of lending in the credit markets  we are exposed to a significant risk that customers will not pay us the amounts that they owe us in order to conserve their capital 
this would lead to increases in our outstanding accounts receivable as a percentage of revenue  extended payback periods and increased risk of customer default 
for example  during the latter part of the fourth quarter of  several key customers experienced a rapid deterioration in their ability to obtain additional capital to fund their businesses 
as a result  these customers declared their inability to make timely payments on their accounts and were unable to demonstrate the ability to pay their existing account balances with us since that time 
during fiscal  a significant number of these customers commenced bankruptcy proceedings 
as of december   all of these bankruptcies were finalized  and we do not expect that we will collect much  if any  of the amounts owed to us by these customers 
we factor the increased risk of non payment into our assessment of our customers ability to pay  and  in some instances  these considerations will likely result in longer revenue deferrals than we had anticipated at the time that we booked sales to those customers 
we also believe that certain of our customers will alter their plans to deploy products to meet the constraints imposed on them by changes in the capital markets 
if we are not able to increase sales to other customers  or if our sales are otherwise delayed or revenue written off  our sales will continue to decline  which would further harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
if we inaccurately estimate customer demand  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be harmed 
we plan our expense levels in part based on our expectations about future revenue 
these expense levels are relatively fixed in the short term 
however  the number of orders for our products may vary from quarter to quarter 
in some circumstances  customers may delay purchasing our current products in favor of next generation products 
in addition  our new products are generally subject to technical evaluations by potential customers that typically last to days 
in the case of intellipop  those evaluations may take up to six months 
if orders forecasted for a specific customer for a particular quarter are delayed or cancelled  our revenue for that quarter may be less than our forecast 
currently  we have minimal risk of loss associated with long term customer commitments or penalties for delayed and or cancelled orders 
however  we may be unable to reduce our spending accordingly in the short term if such a loss occurred  and any such revenue shortfall would have a direct and adverse impact on our results of operations for that quarter 
further  we outsource the manufacturing of our products based on forecasts of sales 
if orders for our products exceed our forecasts  we may have difficulty meeting customers orders in a timely manner  which could damage our reputation or result in lost sales 
conversely  if our forecasts exceed the orders we actually receive and we are unable to cancel future purchase and manufacturing commitments in a timely manner  our inventory levels would increase 
this could expose us to losses related to slow moving and obsolete inventory  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we depend on contract manufacturers to manufacture all of our products and rely on them to deliver high quality products in a timely manner  the failure of these manufacturers to continue to deliver quality products in a timely manner could have a materially adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we do not manufacture our products 
we rely on contract manufacturers to assemble  test and package our products 
we cannot assure you that these contract manufacturers and suppliers will be able to meet our future requirements for manufactured products  components and subassemblies 
in addition  we believe that current market conditions have placed additional financial strain on our contract manufacturers 
any interruption in the operations of one or more of these contract manufacturers would harm our ability to meet our scheduled product 
table of contents deliveries to customers 
we also intend to introduce new products and product enhancements  which will require that we rapidly achieve volume production by coordinating our efforts with those of our suppliers and contract manufacturers 
the inability of our contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of high quality products or the loss of a current contract manufacturer would cause a delay in our ability to fulfill customer orders while we obtain a replacement manufacturer and would harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  we have canceled certain finished goods and component orders  which may harm our relationship with certain contract manufacturers 
moreover  if we do not accurately forecast the actual demand for our products  we may face supply  manufacturing or testing capacity constraints 
these constraints could result in delays in the delivery of our products or the loss of existing or potential customers  either of which could harm our business  operating results or financial condition 
if our contract manufacturers fail to obtain the raw materials and component products we require in a timely manner  our business could be harmed 
we currently purchase most of our raw materials and components used in our products through our contract manufacturers 
components are purchased pursuant to purchase orders based on forecasts  but neither we nor our contract manufacturers have any guaranteed supply arrangements with these suppliers 
the availability of many of these components depends in part on our ability to provide our contract manufacturers and their suppliers with accurate forecasts of our future needs 
if we or our manufacturers are unable to obtain a sufficient supply of key components from current sources  we could experience difficulties in obtaining alternative sources at reasonable prices  if at all  or in altering product designs to use alternative components 
resulting delays and reductions in product shipments could damage customer relationships and could harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  any increases in component costs that are passed on to our customers could reduce demand for our products 
we rely on third parties to test substantially all of our products  and if  for any reason  these third parties were unable to or did not adequately assist us in controlling the quality of our products  this lack of quality control could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
substantially all of our products are assembled and tested by our contract manufacturers 
although we perform random spot testing on manufactured products  we rely on our contract manufacturers for assembly and primary testing of our products 
any quality assurance problems could increase the cost of manufacturing  assembling or testing our products and could harm our business  financial condition and results of operation 
moreover  defects in products that are not discovered in the quality assurance process could damage customer relationships and result in product returns or product liability claims  each of which could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
based on our building specifications  several key components are purchased from single or limited sources  and we could lose sales if these sources fail to fill our needs  if we lose sales  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
we currently purchase most of the raw materials and components used in our products through our contract manufacturers 
in procuring components for our products  we and our contract manufacturers rely on some suppliers that are the sole source of those components  and we are dependent upon supplies from these sources to meet our needs 
we also depend on various sole source offerings from broadcom  metalink us and motorola for certain of our products 
if there is any interruption in the supply of any of the key components currently obtained from a single or limited source  our ability to obtain these components from other sources could entail a substantial lead time which could require us to redesign our products or  if we do not redesign our products to avoid such a lead time  could disrupt our operations and harm our business  financial condition and results of operation in any given period 

table of contents our business relies on the continued growth of the internet  any slowdown in or reversal of the growth of internet use could materially and adversely impact our business 
the market for high speed data access products depends in large part on the continued use and popularity of the internet 
issues concerning the use of the internet  including security  lost or delayed packets  and quality of service may negatively affect the development of the market for our products 
our industry is characterized by rapid technological change  we must continually introduce new products that achieve broad market acceptance in order to address this change and remain competitive 
the markets for high speed data access products are characterized by rapid technological developments  frequent enhancements to existing products and new product introductions  changes in end user requirements and evolving industry standards 
to remain competitive  we must continually improve the performance  features and reliability of our products  particularly in response to competitive product offerings 
we must introduce products that incorporate or are compatible with these new technologies as they emerge and must do so in a timely manner 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to respond quickly and effectively to technological change 
we may have only limited time to penetrate certain markets  and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in achieving widespread acceptance of our products before competitors offer products and services similar or superior to our products 
any failure to introduce new products addressing technological changes or any delay in our product introductions could adversely affect our ability to compete and cause our operating results to be below our expectations or the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
in addition  when we announce new products or product enhancements that have the potential to replace or shorten the life cycle of our existing products  customers may defer purchasing our existing products 
these actions could harm our business  financial condition and operating results by unexpectedly decreasing sales  increasing our inventory levels of older products and exposing us to greater risk of product obsolescence 
manufacturing or design defects in our products could harm our reputation and our business  financial condition and results of operations 
any defect or deficiency in our products could reduce the functionality  effectiveness or marketability of our products 
these defects or deficiencies could cause orders for our products to be canceled or delayed  reduce revenue  or render our product designs obsolete 
in that event  we would be required to devote substantial financial and other resources for a significant period of time to the development of new product designs 
we cannot assure you that we would be successful in addressing any manufacturing or design defects in our products or in developing new product designs in a timely manner  if at all 
any of these events  individually or in the aggregate  could harm our business  financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
changing industry standards may reduce the demand for our products  which would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we will not be competitive unless we continually introduce new products and product enhancements that meet constantly changing industry standards 
the emergence of new industry standards  whether through adoption by official standards committees or through widespread use of such standards by telephone companies or other service providers  could require that we redesign our products 
if these standards become widespread and our products do not comply with these standards  our customers and potential customers may not purchase our products  which would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the rapid development of new standards increases the risk that competitors could develop products that make our products obsolete 
any failure by us to develop and introduce new products or enhancements directed at new industry standards could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  selection of competing technologies as standards by standards setting bodies such as the homepna technology could negatively affect our reputation in the market  regardless of whether our products are standards compliant or demand for our products does not decline 
this selection could be interpreted by the press and others as having a negative impact on our business  which would negatively impact our stock price 

table of contents further  the marketplace s anticipation of an emerging standard  such as mpeg  part h 
could delay the decision to deploy existing products 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates may harm our business 
a majority of our foreign sales are invoiced in us dollars 
as a result  fluctuations in currency exchange rates could cause our products to become relatively more expensive for international customers  thereby reducing demand for our products 
we anticipate that foreign sales will generally continue to be invoiced in us dollars 
accordingly  we do not currently engage in foreign currency hedging transactions 
however  as we expand our current international operations  we may allow payment in foreign currencies and  as a result  our exposure to foreign currency transaction losses may increase 
to reduce this exposure  we may purchase forward foreign exchange contracts or use other hedging strategies 
however  we cannot assure you that any currency hedging strategy would be successful in avoiding exchange related losses 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property or if others use our proprietary technology without our authorization  our competitive position may suffer 
our future success and ability to compete depends in part on our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of copyright  patent  trademark and trade secrets laws and nondisclosure agreements to establish and protect our proprietary technology 
we currently hold united states patents and have united states patent applications pending 
however  we cannot assure you that patents will be issued with respect to pending or future patent applications that we have filed or plan to file or that our patents will be upheld as valid or will prevent the development of competitive products or that any actions we have taken will adequately protect our intellectual property rights 
we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants  resellers  customers and potential customers in which we strictly limit access to and distribution of our software and further limit the disclosure and use of our proprietary information 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain or use our products or technology 
our competitors may also independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
we may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims that are costly to defend and could harm our business and ability to compete 
our industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights 
we are subject to the risk of adverse claims and litigation alleging infringement of the intellectual property rights of others 
from time to time  third parties may assert infringement claims with respect to our current or future products 
any such assertion  regardless of its merit  could require us to pay damages or settlement amounts and could require us to develop non infringing technology or acquire licenses to the technology that is the subject of the asserted infringement 
this litigation or potential litigation could result in product delays  increased costs or both 
in addition  the cost of any litigation and the resulting distraction of our management resources to address such litigation could harm our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we also cannot assure you that any licenses of technology necessary for our business will be available or that  if available  these licenses can be obtained on commercially reasonable terms 
our failure to obtain these licenses could harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents if our products do not comply with complex government regulations  our products may not be sold  preventing us from increasing our revenue or achieving profitability 
we and our customers are subject to varying degrees of federal  state and local regulation 
our products must comply with various regulations and standards defined by the federal communications commission  or fcc 
the fcc has issued regulations that set installation and equipment standards for communications systems 
our products are also required to meet certain safety requirements 
for example  certain of our products must be certified by underwriters laboratories in order to meet federal safety requirements relating to electrical appliances to be used inside the home 
in addition  certain products must be network equipment building standard certified before they may be deployed by certain of our customers 
any delay in or failure to obtain these approvals could harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 
outside of the united states  our products are subject to the regulatory requirements of each country in which our products are manufactured or sold 
these requirements are likely to vary widely 
if we do not obtain timely domestic or foreign regulatory approvals or certificates  we would not be able to sell our products where these regulations apply  which may prevent us from sustaining our revenue or achieving profitability 
in addition  regulation of our customers may adversely impact our business  operating results and financial condition 
for example  fcc regulatory policies affecting the availability of data and internet services and other terms on which telecommunications companies conduct their business may impede our penetration of certain markets 
in addition  the increasing demand for communications systems has exerted pressure on regulatory bodies worldwide to adopt new standards  generally following extensive investigation of competing technologies 
the delays inherent in this governmental approval process may cause the cancellation  postponement or rescheduling of the installation of communications systems by our customers  which in turn may harm our sale of products to these customers 
if our customers do not receive adequate and timely customer support from us or our third party providers  our relationships with our customers could be damaged  which would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to achieve our planned sales growth and retain customers will depend in part on the quality of our customer support operations 
our customers generally require significant support and training with respect to our products  particularly in the initial deployment and implementation stage 
as our systems and products become more complex  we believe our ability to provide adequate customer support will be increasingly important to our success 
moreover  we believe that our intellipop products will add a significant layer of complexity to the demands on our customer support organizations 
we have limited experience with widespread deployment of our products to a diverse customer base  and we cannot assure you that we will have adequate personnel to provide the levels of support that our customers may require during initial product deployment or on an ongoing basis 
in addition  we rely on a third party for a substantial portion of our customer support functions  and therefore  we may have limited control over the level of support that is provided 
our failure to provide sufficient support to our customers could delay or prevent the successful deployment of our products 
failure to provide adequate support could also have an adverse impact on our reputation and relationship with our customers  could prevent us from gaining new customers and could harm our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if we lose key personnel or are unable to hire additional qualified personnel as necessary  we may not be able to manage our business successfully  which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend on the performance of salvatore d auria  our president  chief executive officer and chairman of the board and douglas shafer  our chief financial officer  vice president  finance and administration  and secretary  and on other senior management and technical personnel with experience in the data communications  telecommunications and high speed data access industries 
the loss of any one of them could harm our ability to execute our business strategy 
additionally  we do not have employment contracts with any of our executive 
table of contents officers 
we believe that our future success will depend in large part on our continued ability to identify  hire  retain and motivate highly skilled employees who are in great demand 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so 
our stock price has fluctuated and is likely to continue to fluctuate  and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above their purchase price 
the price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile 
our stock price could fluctuate widely in response to many factors  including  but not limited to  the following actual or anticipated variations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations  new products or new services by us or by our partners  competitors or customers  changes in financial estimates or recommendations by stock market analysts regarding us or our competitors  conditions or trends in the telecommunications industry  including regulatory developments  our announcement of a significant acquisition  strategic partnership  joint venture or capital commitment  additions or departures of key personnel  future equity or debt offerings or our announcements of these offerings  and general market and economic conditions 
in addition  in recent years  the stock market in general  and the nasdaq national market and the securities of internet and technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations with severe drops 
these fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these technology companies 
these market and industry factors may harm our stock price  regardless of our operating results 
our stock may be delisted from the nasdaq national market 
nasdaq corporate governance rules require that all shares listed on the nasdaq national market maintain a minimum bid price at closing of per share 
our failure to maintain such a minimum bid price for a period of thirty or more consecutive trading days could result in the nasdaq governing board taking action to remove our shares from the nasdaq national market 
in the second half of  the minimum closing bid price of our common stock was consistently below per share 
on september   we received a nasdaq delisting notice because our common stock had closed below per share for consecutive trading days 
if the bid price of our common stock had not closed at per share or more for a minimum of consecutive trading days before december   our stock would have been delisted from the nasdaq national market 
on november   we received a notice from the nasdaq that our stock price had traded above per share for the required consecutive days 
since that time  our stock has not traded below the required minimum bid price at closing of per share 
however  based on the various risks noted elsewhere in this annual report on form k as well as the fact that our stock price continues to trade below per share  we nevertheless continue to face the risk of a delisting from the nasdaq national market 
the delisting of our common stock as well as the threat of delisting of our common stock may negatively impact the value of our shares because shares that trade on the over the counter market  rather than the nasdaq national market  are typically less liquid and  therefore  trade with larger variations between the bid and asking price 
our charter  bylaws  retention and change of control plans and delaware law contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control 
certain provisions of our charter and bylaws and our retention and change of control plans  the plans  may have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or of discouraging a third party from 
table of contents attempting to acquire  control of us 
the provisions of the charter and bylaws and the plans could limit the price that certain investors may be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
our charter and bylaws provide for a classified board of directors  eliminate cumulative voting in the election of directors  restrict our stockholders from acting by written consent and calling special meetings  and provide for procedures for advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals 
in addition  our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the issuance of preferred stock  while providing flexibility in connection with possible financings or acquisitions or other corporate purposes  could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
the plans provide for severance payments and accelerated stock option vesting in the event of termination of employment following a change of control 
the provisions of the charter and bylaws  and the plans  as well as section of the delaware general corporation law  to which we are subject  could discourage potential acquisition proposals  delay or prevent a change of control and prevent changes in our management 
future sales of our common stock could depress our stock price 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market  or the appearance that these shares are available for sale  could harm the market price of our common stock 
also  we may from time to time need to register shares of our common stock for resale  which registration and resale may increase the number of our shares that are publicly traded  thereby adversely impacting the per share price of our common stock 
in particular  see page of this annual report on form k regarding our contractual commitment to tektronix 
these sales also may make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities or equity related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate 
as of december   we had  shares outstanding 
of these shares   shares of our common stock are currently available for sale in the public market  some of which are subject to volume and other limitations under securities laws 
our pleasanton  california facility is located near known earthquake fault zones  and the occurrence of an earthquake or other natural disaster could cause damage to our facility and equipment which could require us to curtail or cease operations 
our pleasanton  california facility is located in the san francisco bay area near known earthquake fault zones and are vulnerable to damage from earthquakes 
in october  a major earthquake that caused significant property damage and a number of fatalities struck this area 
we are also vulnerable to damage from other types of disasters  including fire  floods  power loss  communications failures and similar events 
if any disaster were to occur  our ability to operate our business at our pleasanton  california facility could be seriously  or completely  impaired 
the insurance we maintain may not be adequate to cover our losses resulting from disasters or other business interruptions 
we rely on a continuous power supply to conduct our operations  and a statewide energy crisis could disrupt our operations and increase our expenses 
in the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  california suffered an energy crisis that could have disrupted our operations and increased our expenses 
in the event of an acute power shortage which occurs when power reserves for the state of california fall below  california has on some occasions implemented  and may in the future implement  rolling blackouts throughout the state 
we currently do not have backup generators or alternate sources of power in the event of a blackout  and our current insurance does not provide coverage for any damages we or our customers may suffer as a result of any interruption in our power supply 
if california were to suffer a similar energy crisis in the future and blackouts interrupt our power supply  we would be temporarily unable to continue operations at our pleasanton  california facility 
any such interruption in our ability to continue operations at our facilities could damage our reputation  harm our ability to retain existing customers and to obtain new customers  and could result in lost revenue  any of which could substantially harm our business and results of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk as of december   we did not have investments 
an immediate change in interest rate would be immaterial to our financial condition or results of operations 
the principal amount of cash and cash equivalents at december  totaled million with a related weighted average interest rate of 
our long term debt of million at december  carries a weighted average fixed interest rate of per annum with principal payment of the entire note payable balance due in november we do not have short term notes payable

although payments under certain of our operating leases for our facilities are tied to market indices  we are not exposed to material interest rate risk associated with our operating leases 
foreign currency risk we transact business primarily in the us dollar 
to date  the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on revenues has not been material  as the majority of our revenues are earned in us dollars 
an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive and  therefore  reduce the demand for our product 
for our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is the local currency  we translate assets and liabilities to us dollars using the period end exchange rates and translate revenues and expenses to us dollars using average exchange rates during the period 
exchange gains and losses arising from translation of foreign subsidiary financial statements are reported as a separate component on our statement of stockholders equity 
to date  the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on translation has not been material
