item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in combination with our consolidated financial statements included in item herein 
overview we are a public utility holding company  created on august  as part of a corporate restructuring of reliant energy  incorporated reliant energy in compliance with requirements of the texas electric restructuring law 
we are the successor to reliant energy for financial reporting purposes under the securities exchange act of our wholly owned operating subsidiaries own and operate electric generation plants  electric transmission and distribution facilities  natural gas distribution facilities and natural gas pipelines 
we are subject to regulation as a registered holding company under the public utility holding company act of act 
at december   our wholly owned subsidiaries included centerpoint energy houston electric  llc centerpoint houston  which engages in our electric transmission and distribution business in the texas gulf coast area  texas genco holdings  inc texas genco  which owns and operates our texas generating plants  and centerpoint energy resources corp 
cerc corp  and  together with its subsidiaries  cerc  which owns and operates our local gas distribution companies  gas gathering systems and interstate pipelines 
we distributed our ownership interest in reliant resources  inc reliant resources to our shareholders on september  the reliant resources distribution 
we distributed approximately of the outstanding common stock of texas genco to our shareholders on january  in this section we discuss our results from continuing operations on a consolidated basis and individually for each of our business segments 
we also discuss our liquidity  capital resources and critical accounting policies 
our reportable business segments include the following electric transmission distribution  electric generation  natural gas distribution  pipelines and gathering  and other operations 
effective with the full deregulation of sales of electric energy to retail customers in texas beginning in january  power generators and retail electric providers in texas ceased to be subject to traditional cost based regulation 
since that date  we have sold generation capacity  energy and ancillary services related to power generation at prices determined by the market 
our transmission and distribution services remain subject to rate regulation 
beginning january   the basis of business segment reporting has changed for our texas electric operations 
although our former retail sales business is no longer conducted by us  retail customers remained regulated customers of our former integrated electric utility  reliant energy hl p  through the date of their first meter reading in sales of electricity to retail customers in prior to this meter reading are reflected in the electric transmission distribution business segment 
the texas generation operations of reliant energy hl p are now a separate reportable business segment  electric generation  whereas they previously had been part of the electric operations business segment 
the remaining transmission and distribution function is now reported separately in the electric transmission distribution business segment 
in  latin america was a separate business segment  but is now reported in the other operations business segment 
reportable business segments from have been restated to conform to the presentation 
for business segment reporting information  please read notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
the consolidated financial statements have been prepared to reflect the effects of the reliant resources distribution on the centerpoint energy financial statements 
the consolidated financial statements present the reliant resources businesses previously reported as the wholesale energy  european energy and retail energy business segments and related corporate costs as discontinued operations  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

accordingly  the consolidated financial statements include the necessary reclassifications to reflect these operations as discontinued operations for each of the three years in the period ended december  as a result of the reliant resources distribution  centerpoint energy recorded a non cash loss on disposal of discontinued operations of billion in the third quarter of this loss represents the excess of the carrying value of centerpoint energy s net investment in reliant resources over the market value of reliant resources common stock 
as of december  the latin america business operations were no longer reported as discontinued operations and were presented as a single line item in continuing operations within the statement of consolidated operations and as a single line item on the consolidated balance sheet in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for certain events  not addressed in issue no 
relating to an acquired operating unit to be sold 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 which does not permit this single line presentation for assets held and used  such as our latin america investments 
certain reclassifications have been made to our consolidated financial statements to show the retroactive effects of adoption of sfas no 
in february  the company sold its interest in argener  a cogeneration facility in argentina  for million 
the carrying value of this investment was approximately million as of december  all dollar amounts in the tables that follow are in millions  except for per share amounts

ebit  as defined  is shown because it is a financial measure we use to evaluate the performance of our business segments and we believe it is a measure of financial performance that may be used as a means to analyze and compare companies on the basis of operating performance 
we expect that some analysts and investors will want to review ebit when evaluating our company 
ebit is not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for a measure of performance prepared in accordance with gaap and is not indicative of operating income from operations as determined under gaap 
additionally  our computation of ebit may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures computed by other companies  because all companies do not calculate it in the same fashion 
we consider operating income to be a comparable measure under gaap 
we believe the difference between operating income and ebit on both a consolidated and business segment basis is not material 
we have provided a reconciliation of consolidated operating income to ebit and ebit to net income below as well as in the individual business segment discussion that follows 
year ended december  in millions reconciliation of operating income to ebit and ebit to net income loss attributable to common shareholders operating income    loss from equity investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries loss on aol time warner investment gain on indexed debt securities impairment of latin america equity investments loss on disposal of latin america equity investments other income  net ebit    interest expense and distribution on trust preferred securities income tax expense income from continuing operations before income taxes  extraordinary item  cumulative effect of accounting change and preferred dividends income from discontinued operations  net of tax loss on disposal of discontinued operations  extraordinary item  net of tax cumulative effect of accounting change  net of tax preferred dividends net income loss attributable to common shareholders  compared to income from continuing operations

 goodwill and other intangibles sfas no 

during  we recognized million of goodwill amortization expense 
the million decrease in income from continuing operations before the cumulative effect of accounting change  extraordinary item and preferred dividends for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in was primarily due to the following a million decrease in ebit from our electric business segments  reflecting the movement of a portion of this business to reliant resources retail energy business segment and reduced rates of return on these regulated operations effective january  a million increase in ebit from our natural gas distribution business segment  a million increase in ebit from our pipelines and gathering business segment  a million increase in ebit from our other operations business segment  a million increase in interest expense due to higher borrowing costs  and a million decrease in income tax expense 
income tax expense 
the effective tax rates for and were and  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate for compared to was primarily due to an increase in state taxes  a reduced benefit from the amortization of investment tax credits and a higher effective tax rate related to our latin america operations  offset by the discontinuance of goodwill amortization in accordance with sfas no 
extraordinary item 
the results reflect a million after tax loss resulting from the early extinguishment of debt related to centerpoint houston s million term loan and the repurchase of million of centerpoint energy s pollution control bonds

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended sfas no 

for additional discussion of the adoption of sfas no 
 please read note to our consolidated financial statements 
compared to income from continuing operations 
we reported income from continuing operations of million per diluted share for  before a cumulative effect of accounting change of million  net of tax  related to the adoption of sfas no 
 compared to million per diluted share for the increase in income from continuing operations of million was primarily due to the following a million decrease in loss before income and taxes from our other operations business segment  primarily due to a million decrease in losses impairments related to our latin america operations and a million decrease in a non cash loss on our aol time warner investment and our related indexed debt securities in as compared to  and a million increase in ebit from our natural gas distribution segment 
the above items were partially offset by a million decrease in ebit from our electric business segments primarily due to the impact of milder weather  reduced rates charged to certain governmental agencies as mandated by the texas electric restructuring law  fees paid for the early termination of an accounts receivable factoring agreement and higher benefit expenses  and an increase in net interest expense of million primarily related to interest rate swaps entered into in and the issuance of the series transition bonds in income tax expense 
the effective tax rates for and were and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate in compared to was primarily due to non recurring increased tax expense arising from the sale of our latin america investments  including the write off of deferred tax assets related to the latin america business segment in and a decrease in state taxes in compared to aol time warner investment and indexed debt securities in  holders of approximately of the million zero premium exchangeable subordinated notes due zens originally issued exercised their right to exchange their zens for cash  resulting in aggregate cash payments by centerpoint energy of approximately million 
one of our subsidiaries owns shares of aol tw common stock aol tw common and elected to liquidate a portion of such holdings to facilitate the company s making the cash payments for the zens exchanged in in connection with the exchanges in  we received net proceeds of approximately million from the liquidation of approximately million shares of aol tw common at an average price of per share 
we now hold million shares of aol tw common which are classified as trading securities under sfas no 
and are expected to be held to facilitate our ability to meet our obligation under the zens 
for additional information regarding our investment in aol tw  our indexed debt securities and the effect of adoption of sfas no 
on january  on our zens obligation  please read note to our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations by business segment the following table presents ebit in millions for each of our business segments for  and some amounts from the previous years have been reclassified to conform to the presentation of the financial statements 
these reclassifications do not affect consolidated net income 
ebit by business segment year ended december  in millions electric transmission distribution  electric generation electric eliminations total electric business segments   natural gas distribution pipelines and gathering other operations eliminations total consolidated ebit    electric business segments beginning in  we are reporting two new business segments for what was the former electric operations business segment electric transmission distribution  and electric generation 
the electric transmission distribution business segment reports results from two sources 
this business segment includes the regulated electric transmission and distribution operations as well as impacts of generation related stranded costs recoverable by the regulated utility 
the previously regulated generation operations in texas are being reported in the new electric generation business segment 
as a result of the implementation of deregulation and the corresponding new business segments  the regulated transmission and distribution utility recovers the cost of its service through an energy delivery charge  and not as a component of the prior bundled rate  which included energy and delivery charges 
the design of the new energy delivery rate differs from the prior bundled rate 
the winter summer rate differential for residential customers has been eliminated and the energy component of the rate structure for commercial and industrial customers has been removed  which will tend to lessen some of the pronounced seasonal variation of revenues which has been experienced in prior periods 
although our former retail sales business is no longer conducted by us  retail customers remained regulated customers of reliant energy hl p through the date of their first meter reading in operations during this transition period are reflected in the electric transmission distribution business segment 
the new electric transmission distribution business segment  centerpoint houston  reported ebit of billion for  consisting of ebit of million for the regulated electric transmission and distribution business  including retail sales during the transition period as discussed above  and non cash ebit of million of excess cost over market ecom regulatory assets associated with costs recorded pursuant to the texas electric restructuring law as explained below 
operating revenues were billion  excluding ecom  and purchased power costs were million in the purchased power costs relate to operation of the regulated utility during the transition period discussed above 
in the electric transmission distribution business segment  throughput declined during as compared to the decrease was primarily due to reduced energy delivery in the industrial sector resulting from self generation by several major customers  partially offset by increased residential usage primarily due to non weather related factors 
additionally  despite a slowing economy  total metered customers continued to grow at an annual rate of approximately during the year 
the new electric generation business segment  texas genco  is comprised of over  megawatts of electric generation located entirely in the state of texas 
this business segment reported a loss before interest and taxes of million for  primarily due to low natural gas prices and ample generating capacity in texas  which created a weak price environment when the capacity auctions described below were conducted in late and early operating revenues were billion and fuel and purchased power costs were billion in under the texas electric restructuring law  each power generator that is unbundled from an integrated electric utility in texas has an obligation to conduct state mandated capacity auctions of of its capacity 
in addition  under a master separation agreement between centerpoint energy and reliant resources  texas genco is contractually obligated to auction all capacity in excess of the state mandated capacity auctions 
the auctions conducted periodically between september and january were consummated at prices below those used in the ecom model by the texas utility commission 
under the texas electric restructuring law  a regulated utility  in our case  centerpoint houston  may recover in a regulatory proceeding scheduled for any difference between market prices received through the state mandated auctions and the texas utility commission s earlier estimates of those market prices 
this difference  recorded as a regulatory asset  produced million of ebit in the following tables provide summary data of our electric transmission distribution and electric generation business segments for and our electric operations business segment for and in millions  except throughput  power sales and electric sales data year ended december  electric transmission electric distribution generation eliminations total in millions operating revenues electric revenues    ecom true up total operating revenues    operating expenses fuel and purchased power   operation and maintenance depreciation and amortization taxes other than income taxes total operating expenses    operating income loss  other income  net earnings before interest and income taxes  throughput in gigawatt hours gwh residential  commercial  industrial  other total  generation power sales in gwh  year ended december  operating revenues    operating expenses fuel and purchased power    operation and maintenance  depreciation and amortization taxes other than income taxes total operating expenses    operating income   other income  net earnings before interest and income taxes   electric sales in gwh residential   commercial   industrial   other  total   compared to during  our electric operations business segment reflected the regulated electric utility business  including generation  transmission and distribution  and retail electric sales 
as of january   with the opening of the texas market to full retail electric competition  generation and retail sales are no longer subject to cost of service regulation 
retail electric sales involve the sale of electricity and related services to end users of electricity and were included as part of the bundled regulated service prior to beginning in january  our operations no longer include retail electricity sales 
accordingly  there are no meaningful comparisons for these business segments against prior periods 
operation and maintenance expenses for the electric transmission distribution and electric generation segments decreased by million in compared to those of the electric operations business segment in the decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in factoring expense as a result of the termination of an agreement under which the former electric operations business segment had sold its customer accounts receivable  a million decrease due to fewer plant outages in  a million decrease in transmission cost of service  and a million decrease in transmission line losses in as this is now a cost of retail electric providers 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in benefits expense  including severance costs of million in connection with the voluntary early retirement program resulting from the mothballing of generating capacity by texas genco and the reduction in work force by centerpoint houston in in june  the texas utility commission issued an order approving a transition to competition plan transition plan filed by reliant energy in december in order to reduce reliant energy s exposure to potential stranded costs related to generation assets  the transition plan permitted the redirection of depreciation expense to generation assets that reliant energy otherwise would apply to transmission  distribution and general plant assets 
in addition  the transition plan provided that all earnings above a stated overall annual rate of return on invested capital be used to recover reliant energy s investment in generation assets 
reliant energy implemented the transition plan effective january  for further discussion of the transition plan  please read note a to our consolidated financial statements 
depreciation and amortization decreased million in  compared to the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in amortization of the book impairment regulatory asset million recorded in june  which was fully amortized in december  offset by depreciation expense recorded in as a result of the discontinuance of redirection of depreciation expense related to electric transmission and distribution assets million and increased amortization related to transition property associated with the transition bonds issued in november million 
for further discussion related to the impairment recorded in june  please read note a to our consolidated financial statements 
taxes other than income taxes decreased million compared to the decrease was primarily due to lower property taxes due to lower tax valuations of generation assets million  lower gross receipts taxes million  which became the responsibility of the retail electric providers upon deregulation  and lower franchise taxes million 
other income  net decreased million in compared to the decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in interest income from under recovery of fuel in as compared to  partially offset by a million increase in interest income from affiliated parties 
compared to our electric operations business segment s ebit for decreased million compared to the decrease was primarily due to milder weather  decreased customer demand  increased contract services and benefit expenses and a charge recorded in the fourth quarter of resulting from the early termination of an accounts receivable factoring agreement 
the decrease was also due to the implementation of the pilot program for texas deregulation in august  reduced rates for certain governmental agencies and increased administrative expenses related to the separation of our regulated and unregulated businesses 
these decreases were partially offset by decreased amortization expense and customer growth 
operating revenues increased million in base revenues decreased million in due to decreased customer demand as a result of the effect of milder weather compared to and decreased customer usage on a weather normalized basis 
the weather impact represented approximately million of the decrease in base revenues in as compared to this decrease was offset by increased reconcilable fuel revenue of million 
the increase in reconcilable fuel revenue in resulted primarily from increased fuel costs as discussed below 
the texas utility commission provides for recovery of certain fuel and purchased power costs through a fixed fuel factor included in electric rates 
revenues collected through this factor are adjusted monthly to equal expenses  therefore  these revenues and expenses have no effect on earnings unless fuel costs are subsequently determined not to be recoverable 
the adjusted over under recovery of fuel costs is recorded in our consolidated balance sheets as regulatory liabilities or regulatory assets  respectively 
fuel and purchased power expenses in increased by million  or  over expenses 
this increase is due to increased purchased power volume related to the load balancing requirements associated with ercot adapting to a single control area  with a slightly higher cost for purchased power and per megawatt hour in and  respectively 
the purchased power increase was partially offset by the decline in the volume of natural gas used at a slightly higher rate and per million british thermal units in and  respectively 
operation and maintenance expenses increased million in compared to primarily due to the following items a million increase in benefits expense primarily driven by medical and pension costs  a million increase in contract services due to additional major and solid fuel outages at our generating plants in compared to shorter  routine outages in  an million increase in administrative expenses related to the separation of our regulated and unregulated businesses  and a million charge recorded in the fourth quarter of resulting from the early termination of an accounts receivable factoring agreement 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased million primarily due to a decrease in amortization of the book impairment regulatory asset recorded in june and decreased amortization expense due to regulatory assets related to cancelled projects being fully amortized in june  partially offset by accelerated amortization of certain regulatory assets related to energy conservation management as required by the texas utility commission 
other income  net increased million in compared to the increase was primarily due to an increase in interest income from under recovery of fuel in compared to natural gas distribution our natural gas distribution business segment s operations consist of intrastate natural gas sales to  and natural gas transportation for  residential  commercial and industrial customers in arkansas  louisiana  minnesota  mississippi  oklahoma and texas 
this business segment s operations also include non rate regulated natural gas sales to and transportation services for commercial and industrial customers in the six states listed above as well as several other midwestern states 
the following table provides summary data of our natural gas distribution business segment for  and in millions  except throughput data year ended december  operating revenues    operating expenses natural gas    operation and maintenance depreciation and amortization taxes other than income taxes total operating expenses    operating income other income  net earnings before interest and income taxes throughput in billion cubic feet bcf residential and commercial sales industrial sales transportation non rate regulated commercial and industrial total throughput generally  the utility operations of our natural gas distribution business segment are allowed to flow through the cost of natural gas to our customers through purchased gas adjustment provisions in tariffs adopted pursuant to regulations of the states in which they operate 
differences between actual gas costs and the amount collected from customers are deferred on the balance sheet so that there is no material impact on ebit 
compared to our natural gas distribution business segment s ebit increased million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in operating margins revenues less fuel costs in were million higher than in primarily as a result of improved margins from rate increases in  a increase in throughput and changes in estimates of unbilled revenues and deferred gas costs  which reduced operating margins in operation and maintenance expenses decreased million in as compared to primarily due to a reduction in bad debt expense in as a result of improved collections and lower gas prices  offset by higher benefits expense and administrative expenses 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased approximately million for the year ended december  primarily as a result of the discontinuance of goodwill amortization in accordance with sfas no 
as further discussed in note d to our consolidated financial statements 
goodwill amortization was million for the year ended december  this was partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense due to an increased asset base 
taxes other than income taxes decreased million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in  due primarily to reduced franchise fees as a result of decreased revenues 
compared to our natural gas distribution business segment s ebit increased million in from operating margins revenues less fuel costs in were million higher than in primarily due to increased volumes in the first quarter of due to the effect of colder weather  partially offset by changes in estimates of unbilled revenues and recoverability of deferred gas accounts and other items 
operation and maintenance expenses decreased million in as compared to primarily due to expenses totaling approximately million incurred in in connection with exiting certain non rate regulated natural gas business activities outside our established market areas offset by the following items increased bad debt expense due to higher natural gas prices in the first quarter of  and higher employee benefit costs 
other income  net increased million in compared to the increase was primarily due to a million increase in interest income from affiliated parties 
pipelines and gathering our pipelines and gathering business segment operates two interstate natural gas pipelines and provides gathering and pipeline services 
the following table provides summary data of our pipelines and gathering business segment for  and in millions  except throughput data year ended december  operating revenues operating expenses natural gas operation and maintenance depreciation and amortization taxes other than income taxes total operating expenses operating income other income  net earnings before interest and income taxes throughput bcf natural gas sales transportation gathering elimination total throughput    elimination of volumes both transported and sold 
compared to our pipelines and gathering business segment s ebit increased million in from as discussed below 
operation and maintenance expenses increased million for the year ended december  compared to primarily due to project work consisting of construction management  material acquisition  engineering  project planning and other services as well as increased employee benefit costs 
project work expenses are offset by revenues billed for these services 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased million in as compared to primarily as a result of the discontinuance of goodwill amortization in accordance with sfas no 
as further discussed in note d to our consolidated financial statements 
other income increased million in as compared to primarily due to interest accrued on a fuel related sales tax refund 
compared to our pipelines and gathering business segment s ebit for was consistent with results 
increased gas gathering and processing revenues were offset by increased operating expenses associated with a rate case which began in  higher employee benefit costs and increased franchise taxes 
other operations our other operations business segment consists primarily of our latin america operations  office buildings and other real estate used in our business operations  district cooling in the central business district in downtown houston  energy management services and other corporate operations which support all of our business operations 
the following table shows ebit of our other operations business segment for the  and year ended december  operating revenues operating expenses operating income loss other expense  net earnings loss before interest and income taxes compared to our other operations business segment s ebit increased by million in compared to the increase was primarily due to a million pre tax decrease in losses impairments related to our latin america investments  reductions in unallocated corporate costs of million and reductions in corporate accruals  primarily benefits  of million 
compared to other operations loss before interest and taxes decreased by million in compared to this decrease was primarily due to a million pre tax decrease in losses impairments related to our latin america investments in and a million pre tax decrease in a non cash loss on our aol tw investment and related indexed debt securities in as compared to discontinued operations on september   centerpoint energy distributed all of the shares of reliant resources common stock owned by centerpoint energy on a pro rata basis to shareholders of centerpoint energy common stock 
the consolidated financial statements have been prepared to reflect the effect of the reliant resources distribution as described above on the centerpoint energy consolidated financial statements 
the consolidated financial statements present the reliant resources businesses wholesale energy  european energy  retail energy and related corporate costs as discontinued operations for each of the years in the two year period ended december  and for the nine months ended september  we also recorded a billion non cash loss on disposal of these discontinued operations 
this loss represents the excess of the carrying value of our net investment in reliant resources over the market value of reliant resources common stock

certain factors affecting future earnings our past earnings and results of operations are not necessarily indicative of our future earnings and results of operations 
the magnitude of our future earnings and results of our operations will depend on numerous factors including state and federal legislative and regulatory actions or developments  including deregulation  re regulation and restructuring of the electric utility industry  constraints placed on our activities or business by the act  changes in or application of laws or regulations applicable to other aspects of our business and actions with respect to approval of stranded costs  allowed rates of return  rate structures  recovery of investments  and operation and construction of facilities  non payment for our services due to financial distress of our customers  including reliant resources  the successful and timely completion of our capital projects  industrial  commercial and residential growth in our service territory and changes in market demand and demographic patterns  changes in business strategy or development plans  the timing and extent of changes in commodity prices  particularly natural gas  changes in interest rates or rates of inflation  unanticipated changes in operating expenses and capital expenditures  weather variations and other natural phenomena  commercial bank and financial market conditions  our access to capital  the cost of such capital  receipt of certain approvals under the act  and the results of our financing and refinancing efforts  including availability of funds in the debt capital markets  actions by rating agencies  legal and administrative proceedings and settlements  changes in tax laws  inability of various counterparties to meet their obligations with respect to our financial instruments  any lack of effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures  changes in technology  significant changes in our relationship with our employees  including the availability of qualified personnel and the potential adverse effects if labor disputes or grievances were to occur  significant changes in critical accounting policies  acts of terrorism or war  including any direct or indirect effect on our business resulting from terrorist attacks such as occurred on september  or any similar incidents or responses to those incidents  the availability and price of insurance  the outcome of the pending securities lawsuits against us  reliant energy and reliant resources  the outcome of the securities and exchange commission investigation relating to the treatment in our consolidated financial statements of certain activities of reliant resources  the ability of reliant resources to satisfy its indemnity obligations to us  the reliability of the systems  procedures and other infrastructure necessary to operate the retail electric business in our service territory  including the systems owned and operated by the ercot iso  political  legal  regulatory and economic conditions and developments in the united states  and other factors discussed in item of this report under risk factors 
liquidity and capital resources historical cash flows the net cash provided by used in operating  investing and financing activities for  and is as follows in millions year ended december  cash provided by used in operating activities  investing activities  financing activities   cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operations in decreased billion compared to this decrease primarily resulted from a billion increase in net regulatory assets and liabilities due primarily to refunds of excess mitigation credits to ratepayers in million and an increase in non cash revenue related to the ecom true up  which resulted in a million increase in regulatory assets in  as well as million paid in connection with the settlement of forward starting interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of billion 
other changes in working capital also contributed to this decrease 
net cash provided by operations in increased million compared to this increase primarily resulted from significant reductions in accounts receivable  partially offset by reductions in accounts payable  during compared to as a result of higher natural gas prices experienced in late  and an increase in recovered fuel costs by our electric business segments 
this increase was partially offset by other changes in working capital 
cash used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities decreased million during compared to due primarily to decreased environmental related capital expenditures in our electric business segments 
net cash used in investing activities increased million during compared to this increase was primarily due to additional capital expenditures in of million primarily related to our electric business segments  offset by net proceeds of million received in from the sale of our latin america assets  net of investments and advances 
cash provided by used in financing activities cash flows provided by financing activities increased billion in compared to  primarily due to an increase in short term borrowings of million as compared to a decrease in short term borrowings of billion in cash flows used in financing activities increased billion in compared to  primarily due to a decline in short term borrowings  partially offset by an increase in proceeds from long term debt 
future sources and uses of cash we believe that our borrowing capability combined with cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet the operational capital and debt service needs of our businesses for the next twelve months 
our liquidity and capital requirements will be affected by capital expenditures  debt service requirements  various regulatory actions  and working capital requirements 
the following table sets forth our capital requirements for  and estimates of our capital requirements for through in millions electric transmission distribution electric generation with nuclear fuel natural gas distribution pipelines and gathering other operations total it is anticipated that reliant resources will purchase the majority interest in texas genco held by centerpoint energy in early pursuant to the terms of an option that reliant resources holds or that this interest or individual generating assets will otherwise be sold to one or more other parties 
the following table sets forth estimates of our contractual obligations to make future payments for through and thereafter in millions and contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt    capital leases short term borrowing  including credit facilities trust preferred securities operating lease payments non trading derivative liabilities other commodity commitments  total contractual cash obligations     on february   centerpoint energy extended the termination date of its billion credit facility to june  as discussed further below 
as a result of this extension  the billion credit facility has been classified as long term debt as of december  in the consolidated balance sheet 
for a discussion of operating leases  please read note b to our consolidated financial statements 
for a discussion of other commodity commitments  please read note a to our consolidated financial statements 
long term debt 
our long term debt consists of our obligations and obligations of our subsidiaries  including transition bonds issued by an indirect wholly owned subsidiary transition bonds 
on february   we reached agreement with a syndicate of banks on a second amendment to our billion bank facility the second amendment 
under the second amendment  the maturity date of the bank facility was extended from october to june   and the billion in mandatory prepayments that would have been required this year including million due on february  were eliminated 
the facility consists of a billion term loan and a billion revolver 
the revolver was fully drawn as of february  borrowings bear interest based on the london interbank offered rate libor under a pricing grid tied to our credit rating 
at our current credit ratings  the pricing for loans remains the same 
the drawn cost for the facility at our current ratings is libor plus basis points 
we have agreed to pay the banks an extension fee of basis points on the amounts outstanding under the bank facility on october  we also paid million in fees that were due on february   along with million in fees that had been due on june  in addition  the interest rates will be increased by basis points beginning may  if we do not grant the banks a security interest in our stock ownership of texas genco 
granting the security interest in the stock of texas genco requires approval from the sec under the act  which is currently being sought 
that security interest would be released when we sell texas genco  which is expected to occur in proceeds from the sale will be used to reduce the bank facility 
also under the second amendment  on or before may   we expect to grant to the banks warrants to purchase up to  on a fully diluted basis  of our common stock at a price equal to the greater of per share or of the closing price on the new york stock exchange on the date the warrants are issued 
the warrants would not be exercisable for a year after issuance but would remain outstanding for four years  provided  that if we reduce the bank facility during by specified amounts  the warrants will be extinguished 
to the extent that we reduce the bank facility by up to million on or before may   up to half of the warrants will be extinguished on a basis proportionate to the reduction in the credit facility 
to the extent such warrants are not extinguished on or before may   they will vest and become exercisable in accordance with their terms 
whether or not we are able to extinguish warrants on or before may   the remaining of the warrants will be extinguished  again on a proportionate basis  if we reduce the bank facility by up to million by the end of we plan to eliminate the warrants entirely before they vest by accessing the capital markets to fund the total payments of million during  however  because of current financial market conditions and uncertainties regarding such conditions over the balance of the year  there can be no assurance that we will be able to extinguish the warrants or to do so on favorable terms 
the warrants and the underlying common stock would be registered with the sec and could be exercised either through the payment of the purchase price or on a cashless basis under which we would issue a number of shares equal to the difference between the then current market price and the warrant exercise price 
issuance of the warrants is also subject to obtaining sec approval under the act  which is currently being sought 
if that approval is not obtained on or before may   we will provide the banks equivalent cash compensation over the term that our warrants would have been exercisable to the extent they are not otherwise extinguished 
in the second amendment  we also agreed that our quarterly common stock dividend will not exceed per share 
if we have not reduced the bank facility by a total of at least million by the end of  of which at least million has come from the issuance of capital stock or securities linked to capital stock such as convertible debt  the maximum dividend payable during and for the balance of the term of the facility is subject to an additional test 
under that test the maximum permitted quarterly dividend will be the lesser of i per share or ii of our net income per share for the months ended on the last day of the previous quarter 
the second amendment provides that proceeds from capital stock or indebtedness issued or incurred by us must be applied subject to a million basket for cerc and another million basket for borrowings by us and other limited exceptions to repay bank loans and reduce the bank facility 
similarly  cash proceeds from the sale of assets of more than million or  if less  a group of sales aggregating more than million  must be applied to repay bank loans and reduce the bank facility  except that proceeds of up to million can be reinvested in our businesses 
on november   centerpoint houston entered into a billion collateralized term loan maturing november the interest rate on the loan is libor plus  subject to a minimum rate of 
the loan is secured by centerpoint houston s general mortgage bonds 
proceeds from the loan were used to repay centerpoint houston s million term loan  to repay million of debt that matured on november   to purchase million of pollution control bonds on december   and to pay costs of issuance 
the loan agreement contains various business and financial covenants  including a covenant restricting centerpoint houston s debt  excluding transition bonds  as a percent of its total capitalization to

one of our indirect finance subsidiaries  centerpoint energy transition bond company  llc  has million aggregate principal amount of outstanding transition bonds that were issued in in accordance with the texas electric restructuring law 
classes of the transition bonds have final maturity dates of september   september   september  and september  and bear interest at rates of   and  respectively 
the transition bonds are secured by transition property  as defined in the texas electric restructuring law  which includes the irrevocable right to recover  through non bypassable transition charges payable by retail electric customers  qualified costs provided in the texas electric restructuring law 
the transition bonds are reported as our long term debt  although the holders of the transition bonds have no recourse to any of our assets or revenues  and our creditors have no recourse to any assets or revenues including  without limitation  the transition charges of the transition bond company 
centerpoint houston has no payment obligations with respect to the transition bonds except to remit collections of transition charges as set forth in a servicing agreement between centerpoint houston and the transition bond company and in an intercreditor agreement among centerpoint houston  our indirect transition bond subsidiary and other parties 
we purchased million principal amount of outstanding pollution control bonds in the fourth quarter of at of their principal amount 
if market conditions permit  we expect to remarket the million principal amount of pollution control bonds in the first half of long term debt maturities in include million principal amount of medium term notes maturing in april and million principal amount of pollution control bonds maturing in december in addition  cerc corp 
has million principal amount of term enhanced remarketable securities that must be repaid or remarketed in november we have million of outstanding zens that may be exchanged for cash at any time 
holders of zens submitted for exchange are entitled to receive a cash payment equal to of the market value of the reference shares of aol tw common 
there are reference shares of aol tw common for each of the million zens units originally issued of which approximately were exchanged for cash of approximately million in 
the exchange market value is calculated using the average closing price per share of aol tw common on the new york stock exchange on one or more trading days following the notice date for the exchange 
one of our subsidiaries owns the reference shares of aol tw common and generally liquidates such holdings to the extent of zens exchanged 
cash proceeds from such liquidations are used to fund zens exchanged for cash 
although proceeds from the sale of aol tw common offset the cash paid on exchanges  zens exchanges result in a cash outflow because of our current tax obligations 
current tax obligations in increased by million as a result of the exchanges of zens having a principal amount of million and the related sale of million shares of aol tw common 
centerpoint houston has issued approximately billion aggregate principal amount of first mortgage bonds and approximately billion aggregate principal amount of general mortgage bonds  of which approximately billion combined aggregate principal amount of first mortgage bonds and general mortgage bonds collateralizes debt of centerpoint energy 
the general mortgage bonds are issued under the general mortgage indenture dated as of october  the lien of the general mortgage indenture is junior to that of the mortgage  pursuant to which the first mortgage bonds are issued 
the aggregate amount of additional general mortgage bonds and first mortgage bonds that could be issued is approximately million based on estimates of the value of property encumbered by the general mortgage  the cost of such property and the bonding ratio contained in the general mortgage 
the issuance of additional first mortgage and general mortgage bonds is currently contractually limited to an additional million of general mortgage bonds 
short term debt and receivables facility 
during  the following bank and receivables facilities are scheduled to terminate on the dates indicated 
borrower seller amount of facility termination date type of facility in millions cerc corp march  revolver cerc corp november  receivables centerpoint houston april  revolver total as of december   there was million borrowed under cerc s million revolving credit facility 
on february   cerc executed a commitment letter with a major bank for a million  day bridge facility  which is subject to the satisfation of various closing conditions 
this facility will be available for repaying borrowings under cerc s existing million revolving credit facility that expires on march  in the event sufficient proceeds are not raised in the capital markets to repay such borrowings on or before march  final terms for the bridge facility have not been established  but it is anticipated that the rates for borrowings under the facility will be libor plus basis points 
cerc paid a commitment fee of basis points on the commitment amount and will be required to pay a facility fee of basis points on the amount funded and an additional basis points on the amount funded and outstanding for more than two months 
in connection with this facility  cerc expects to provide the lender with collateral in the form of a security interest in the stock it owns in its interstate natural gas pipeline subsidiaries 
on december   cerc corp 
had received proceeds from the sale of receivables of approximately million under its million receivables facility and its million bank facility was fully drawn or utilized in the form of letters of credit 
advances under the million receivables facility are not recorded as a financing because the facility provides for the sale of receivables to third parties as discussed in note i to the consolidated financial statements 
in february  centerpoint houston obtained a million revolving credit facility that terminates on april  a condition precedent to utilizing the facility is that security in the form of general mortgage bonds must be delivered to the lender 
rates for borrowings under this facility  including the facility fee  will be libor plus basis points 
on december   we had million of temporary investments 
refunds to centerpoint houston customers 
an order issued by the texas utility commission on october  established the transmission and distribution rates that became effective in january the texas utility commission determined that centerpoint houston had overmitigated its stranded costs by redirecting transmission and distribution depreciation and by accelerating depreciation of generation assets an amount equal to earnings above a stated overall rate of return on rate base that was used to recover our investment in generation assets as provided under the transition plan and the texas electric restructuring law 
in this final order  centerpoint houston is required to reverse the amount of redirected depreciation and accelerated depreciation taken for regulatory purposes as allowed under the transition plan and the texas electric restructuring law 
per the october  order  centerpoint houston recorded a regulatory liability to reflect the prospective refund of the accelerated depreciation 
centerpoint houston began refunding excess mitigation credits with the january unbundled bills  to be refunded over a seven year period 
the annual refund of excess earnings is approximately million 
under the texas electric restructuring law  a final settlement of these stranded costs will occur in cash requirements in our liquidity and capital requirements are affected primarily by our results of operations  capital expenditures  debt service requirements  and working capital needs 
our principal cash requirements during include the following million of maturing long term debt  approximately million of capital expenditures  an estimated million which we are obligated to return to customers as a result of the texas utility commission s findings of over mitigation of stranded costs  remarketing or refinancing of million of cerc corp 
debt  plus the possible payment of option termination costs currently estimated to be million as discussed in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk in item a  payments expected to aggregate million in connection with the termination of bank facilities unless replacement facilities or extensions are arranged  and dividend payments on centerpoint energy common stock 
we expect to meet our capital requirements through cash flows from operations  short term borrowings and proceeds from debt and or equity offerings 
we believe that our current liquidity  along with anticipated cash flows from operations and proceeds from short term borrowings  including the renewal  extension or replacement of existing bank facilities  and anticipated sales of securities in the capital markets will be sufficient to meet our cash needs 
however  disruptions in our ability to access the capital markets on a timely basis could adversely affect our liquidity 
limits on our ability to issue secured debt  as described in this report  may adversely affect our ability to issue debt securities 
in addition  the recent cost of our secured debt issuances has been very high 
a similar cost with regard to additional issuances could significantly impact our debt service 
please read risk factors risk factors associated with financial condition and other risks if we are unable to arrange future financings on acceptable terms  our ability to fund future capital expenditures and refinance existing indebtedness could be limited in item of this report 
at december   centerpoint energy had a shelf registration statement for million shares of common stock and cerc corp 
had a shelf registration statement covering million of debt securities 
the amount of any debt security or any security having equity characteristics that we can issue  whether registered or unregistered  or whether debt is secured or unsecured  is expected to be affected by the market s perception of our creditworthiness  general market conditions and factors affecting our industry 
proceeds from the sales of securities are expected to be used primarily to refinance debt 
principal factors affecting cash requirements in and we anticipate selling our ownership interest in texas genco in should reliant resources decline to exercise its option to purchase our interest in texas genco  we will explore other alternatives to monetize texas genco s assets  including possible sale of our ownership interest in texas genco or of its individual generating assets  which may significantly affect the timing of any cash proceeds 
proceeds from that sale  plus proceeds from the securitization in or of stranded costs related to generating assets of texas genco and generation related regulatory assets  are expected to aggregate in excess of billion 
we expect to issue securitization bonds in or to monetize and recover the balance of stranded costs relating to electric generation assets and other qualified costs as determined in the true up proceeding 
the issuance will be done pursuant to a financing order to be issued by the texas utility commission 
as with the debt of our existing transition bond company  payments on these new securitization bonds would also be made from funds obtained through non bypassable charges assessed to retail electric customers required to take delivery service from centerpoint houston 
the holders of the securitization bonds would not have recourse to any of our assets or revenues  and our creditors would not have recourse to any assets or revenues of the entity issuing the securitization bonds 
all or a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of securitization bonds remaining after repayment of centerpoint houston s billion collateralized term loan are expected to be utilized to retire other existing debt 
impact on liquidity of a downgrade in credit ratings 
as of march   moody s investors service  inc moody s  standard poor s ratings services  a division of the mcgraw hill companies s p  and fitch  inc fitch had assigned the following credit ratings to senior debt of centerpoint energy and certain subsidiaries moody s s p fitch rating outlook rating outlook rating outlook company instrument centerpoint energy senior unsecured debt ba negative bbb stable bbb negative centerpoint houston senior secured debt first mortgage bonds baa stable bbb stable bbb negative cerc corp 
senior debt ba negative bbb stable bbb negative a negative outlook from moody s reflects concerns over the next to months which will either lead to a review for a potential downgrade or a return to a stable outlook 
a stable outlook from moody s indicates that moody s does not expect to put the rating on review for an upgrade or downgrade within months from when the outlook was assigned or last affirmed 
a stable outlook from s p indicates that the rating is not likely to change over the intermediate to longer term 
a negative outlook from fitch encompasses a one to two year horizon as to the likely rating direction 
we cannot assure you that these ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency 
we note that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy  sell or hold our securities and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agency 
each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
any future reduction or withdrawal of one or more of our credit ratings could have a material adverse impact on our ability to obtain short and long term financing  the cost of such financings and the execution of our commercial strategies 
a decline in credit ratings would increase facility fees and borrowing costs under our existing bank credit facilities 
a decline in credit ratings would also increase the interest rate on long term debt to be issued in the capital markets and would negatively impact our ability to complete capital market transactions 
our bank facilities contain material adverse change clauses that could impact our ability to make new borrowings under these facilities 
the material adverse change clauses in most of our bank facilities relate to an event  development or circumstance that has or would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on a the business  financial condition or operations of the borrower and its subsidiaries taken as a whole  or b the legality  validity or enforceability of the loan documents 
the million receivables facility of cerc corp 
requires the maintenance of credit ratings of at least bb from s p and ba from moody s 
receivables would cease to be sold in the event a credit rating fell below the threshold 
each zens note is exchangeable at the holder s option at any time for an amount of cash equal to of the market value of the reference shares of aol tw common attributable to each zens note 
if our creditworthiness were to drop such that zens note holders thought our liquidity was adversely affected or the market for the zens notes were to become illiquid  some zens holders might decide to exchange their zens for cash 
funds for the payment of cash upon exchange could be obtained from the sale of the aol tw common that we own or from other sources 
we own shares of aol tw common equal to of the reference shares used to calculate our obligation to the holders of the zens notes 
zens exchanges result in a cash outflow because deferred tax liabilities related to the zens and aol tw common become current tax obligations when zens are exchanged and aol tw common is sold 
centerpoint energy gas resources corp  a wholly owned subsidiary of cerc corp  provides comprehensive natural gas sales and services to industrial and commercial customers who are primarily located within or near the territories served by our pipelines and distribution subsidiaries 
in order to hedge its exposure to natural gas prices  centerpoint energy gas resources corp 
has agreements with provisions standard for the industry that establish credit thresholds and require a party to provide additional collateral on two business days notice when that party s rating or the rating of a credit support provider for that party cerc corp 
in this case falls below those levels 
as of march   the senior unsecured debt of cerc corp 
was rated bbb by s p and ba by moody s 
based on these ratings  we estimate that unsecured credit limits extended to centerpoint energy gas resources corp 
by counterparties could aggregate million  however  utilized credit capacity is significantly lower 
cross defaults 
under our bank facility  a payment default by us or any of our significant subsidiaries on any indebtedness exceeding million will cause a default 
pension plan 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we maintain a non contributory pension plan covering substantially all employees 
employer contributions are based on actuarial computations that establish the minimum contribution required under the employee retirement income security act of erisa and the maximum deductible contribution for income tax purposes 
during  we contributed from treasury stock million of centerpoint energy common stock to the plan 
no contributions were made to the plan during under the terms of our pension plan  we reserve the right to change  modify or terminate the plan 
our funding policy is to review amounts annually and contribute an amount at least equal to the minimum contribution required under erisa 
plan assets used to satisfy pension obligations have been adversely impacted by the recent decline in equity market values 
however  based on current estimates  we will not be required to make pension contributions until in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  sfas changes in pension obligations and assets may not be immediately recognized as pension costs in the income statement  but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants 
as such  significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of benefit payments provided to plan participants 
in  we recorded a pension benefit of million 
pension costs were million and million for and  respectively 
included in the net pension benefit cost in was million of expense related to reliant resources participants 
for  a pension benefit of million was recorded related to reliant resources participants 
pension benefit and expense for reliant resources participants are reflected in the statement of consolidated operations as discontinued operations 
the calculation of pension expense and related liabilities requires the use of assumptions 
changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts  and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions 
two of the most critical assumptions are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate 
as of december   the expected long term rate of return on plan assets was changed from to 
the change in the assumption was developed by reviewing the plan s targeted asset allocation and asset class return expectations 
we believe that our long term asset allocation on average will approximate the targeted allocation 
we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance plan assets as appropriate 
as of december   the projected benefit obligation was calculated assuming a discount rate of  which is a 
decline from the discount rate assumed in the discount rate was determined by reviewing yields on high quality bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency and the expected duration of pension obligation specific to the characteristics of our plan 
pension expense for is estimated to be million based on an expected return on plan assets of and a discount rate of as of december  if the expected return assumption was lowered by 
from to  pension expense would increase by approximately million 
similarly  if the discount rate was lowered by 
from to  this assumption change would increase our projected benefit obligation  pension liabilities and pension expense by approximately million  million and million  respectively 
in addition  the assumption change would result in an additional charge to comprehensive income during of million  net of tax 
primarily due to the decline in the market value of the pension plan s assets and increased benefit obligations associated with a reduction in the discount rate  the value of the plan s assets is less than our accumulated benefit obligation 
as a result  we recorded a non cash minimum liability adjustment  which resulted in a charge to other comprehensive income during the fourth quarter of of million  net of tax 
recording a minimum liability adjustment did not affect our results of operations during nor our ability to meet any financial covenants related to our debt facilities 
future changes in plan asset returns  assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the pension will impact our future pension expense and liabilities 
we cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future 
other factors that could affect cash requirements 
in addition to the above factors  our liquidity and capital resources could be affected by the need to provide cash collateral in connection with certain contracts  acceleration of payment dates on certain gas supply contracts under certain circumstances  increases in fees and interest expense in connection with debt refinancings  various regulatory actions  and the ability of reliant resources and its subsidiaries to satisfy its obligations as a principal customer of centerpoint houston and texas genco and in respect of its indemnity obligations to us 
money pool 
we have a money pool through which we and our participating subsidiaries can borrow or invest on a short term basis 
funding needs are aggregated and external borrowing or investing is based on the net cash position 
the money pool s net funding requirements are expected to be met with bank loans 
the terms of the money pool are in accordance with requirements applicable to registered public utility holding companies under the act 
capitalization 
factors affecting our capitalization include covenants in our and our subsidiaries bank facilities and other borrowing agreements  and limitations imposed on us as a registered public utility holding company 
the bank facilities of centerpoint houston and cerc corp 
restrict debt as a percentage of total capitalization 
our billion credit agreement limits dividend payments as described above  contains a debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda covenant  an ebitda to interest covenant and restrictions on the use of proceeds from debt issuances and asset sales 
in connection with our registration as a public utility holding company under the act  the sec has placed the following limitations on our external debt the aggregate amount of centerpoint houston s external borrowings has been limited to billion  the aggregate amount of cerc corp 
s external borrowings has been limited to billion  and the aggregate amount of texas genco s external borrowings has been limited to million 
additionally  the sec has placed limitations on our dividends and the dividends of our subsidiaries that require common equity as a percentage of total capitalization for centerpoint houston  cerc corp 
and texas genco to be at least after the payment of such dividends 
the order issued by the sec that authorizes our financing program expires on june   and we must seek a new financing order before that date 
any new order may contain restrictions or authorizations different from those described above 
off balance sheet financing in connection with the november amendment and extension of cerc corp 
s million receivables facility  cerc corp 
formed a bankruptcy remote subsidiary for the sole purpose of buying and selling receivables created by cerc 
this transaction is accounted for as a sale of receivables under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  and  as a result  the related receivables are excluded from our consolidated balance sheets 
for additional information regarding this transaction  please read note i to our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and requires management to make difficult  subjective or complex accounting estimates 
an accounting estimate is an approximation made by management of a financial statement element  item or account in the financial statements 
accounting estimates in our historical consolidated financial statements measure the effects of past business transactions or events  or the present status of an asset or liability 
the accounting estimates described below require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made 
additionally  different estimates that we could have used or changes in an accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations 
the circumstances that make these judgments difficult  subjective and or complex have to do with the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
we believe the following accounting policies involve the application of critical accounting estimates 
accordingly  these accounting estimates have been reviewed and discussed with the audit committee of the board of directors 
accounting for rate regulation sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas no 
 provides that rate regulated entities account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the recovery of those incurred costs in rates if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected 
application of sfas no 
to the electric generation portion of our business was discontinued as of june  our electric transmission distribution business continues to apply sfas no 
which results in our accounting for the regulatory effects of recovery of stranded costs and other regulatory assets resulting from the unbundling of the transmission and distribution business from our electric generation operations in our consolidated financial statements 
certain expenses and revenues subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the balance sheet and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers 
regulatory assets reflected in our consolidated balance sheets aggregated billion and billion as of december  and  respectively 
significant accounting estimates embedded within the application of sfas no 
with respect to our electric transmission distribution business segment relate to billion of recoverable electric generation plant mitigation assets stranded costs and million of ecom true up 
the stranded costs are comprised of billion of previously recorded accelerated depreciation and million of previously redirected depreciation 
these stranded costs are recoverable under the provisions of the texas electric restructuring law 
the ultimate amount of stranded cost recovery is subject to a final determination which will occur in and is contingent upon the market value of texas genco 
any significant changes in our accounting estimate of stranded costs as a result of current market conditions or changes in the regulatory recovery mechanism currently in place could result in a material write down of all or a portion of these regulatory assets 
regulatory assets related to ecom true up represent the regulatory assets associated with costs incurred as a result of mandated capacity auctions conducted beginning in by our electric generation business being consummated at market based prices that have been substantially below the estimate of those prices made by the texas utility commission in the spring of any significant changes in our estimate of our regulatory asset associated with ecom true up could have a significant effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  any significant changes in our estimated stranded costs or ecom true up recovery could significantly affect our liquidity subsequent to the final true up proceedings conducted by the texas utility commission which are expected to conclude in late impairment of long lived assets long lived assets recorded in our consolidated balance sheets primarily consist of property  plant and equipment pp e 
net pp e comprises billion or of our total assets as of december  we make judgments and estimates in conjunction with the carrying value of these assets  including amounts to be capitalized  depreciation and amortization methods and useful lives 
we evaluate our pp e for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist 
accounting standards require that if the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows from a company s asset is less than the carrying value of the asset  an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
the amount of impairment recognized is calculated by subtracting the fair value of the asset from the carrying value of the asset 
as a result of the distribution of approximately of texas genco s common stock to our shareholders on january   we re evaluated our electric generation assets for impairment as of december  this analysis required us to make long term estimates of future cash receipts associated with the operation or sale of these electric generation assets and related cash outflows 
these forecasts require assumptions about demand for electricity within the ercot market  future ercot market conditions  commodity prices and regulatory developments 
as of december   no impairment had been indicated because the estimated cash flows associated with the operations of their assets exceeded their carrying value 
however the effects of competition within the ercot market  the results of our capacity auctions  and the timing and extent of changes in commodity prices  particularly natural gas prices  could have a significant effect on our future cash flows and therefore affect any future determination of asset impairment 
impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets we evaluate our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually and more frequently when indicators of impairment exist 
accounting standards require that if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value  including goodwill  a charge for impairment of goodwill must be recognized 
to measure the amount of the impairment loss  we would compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with its carrying value 
we recorded goodwill associated with the acquisition of our natural gas distribution and pipelines and gathering operations in we reviewed our goodwill for impairment as of january  we computed the fair value of the natural gas distribution and the pipelines and gathering operations as the sum of the discounted estimated net future cash flows applicable to each of these operations 
we determined that the fair value for each of the natural gas distribution operations and the pipelines and gathering operations exceeded their corresponding carrying value  including unallocated goodwill 
we also concluded that no interim impairment indicators existed subsequent to this initial evaluation 
as of december  we had recorded billion of goodwill 
future evaluations of the carrying value of goodwill could be significantly impacted by our estimates of cash flows associated with our natural gas distribution and pipelines and gathering operations  regulatory matters  and estimated operating costs 
unbilled energy revenues revenues related to the sale and or delivery of electricity or natural gas energy are generally recorded when energy is delivered to customers 
however  the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters  which is performed on a systematic basis throughout the month 
at the end of each month  amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last meter reading are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue is estimated 
unbilled electric delivery revenue is estimated each month based on daily supply volumes  applicable rates and analyses reflecting significant historical trends and experience 
unbilled natural gas sales are estimated based on estimated purchased gas volumes  estimated lost and unaccounted for gas and tariffed rates in effect 
accrued unbilled revenues recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as of december  were million related to our electric operations business segment and million related to our natural gas distribution business segment 
accrued unbilled revenues recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as of december  were million related to our electric transmission distribution business segment and million related to our natural gas distribution business segment 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations sfas no 

sfas no 
requires business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and broadens the criteria for recording intangible assets separate from goodwill 
recorded goodwill and intangibles will be evaluated against these new criteria and may result in certain intangibles being transferred to goodwill  or alternatively  amounts initially recorded as goodwill may be separately identified and recognized apart from goodwill 
we adopted the provisions of the statement that apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to june  on january  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have any impact on our historical results of operations or financial position 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 

sfas no 
requires the fair value of an asset retirement obligation to be recognized as a liability is incurred and capitalized as part of the cost of the related tangible long lived assets 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
retirement obligations associated with long lived assets included within the scope of sfas no 
are those for which a legal obligation exists under enacted laws  statutes and written or oral contracts  including obligations arising under the doctrine of promissory estoppel 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   with earlier application encouraged 
sfas no 
requires entities to record a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the income statement in the period of adoption 
we adopted sfas no 
on january  we have completed an assessment of the applicability and implications of sfas no 
as a result of the assessment  we have identified retirement obligations for nuclear decommissioning at the south texas project and for lignite mine operations at the jewett mine supplying the limestone electric generation facility 
nuclear decommissioning and the lignite mine have recorded liabilities under our previous method of accounting 
liabilities recorded for estimated decommissioning obligations were million and million at december  and  respectively 
liabilities recorded for estimated lignite mine reclamation costs were million and million at december  and  respectively 
we have also identified other asset retirement obligations that cannot be calculated because the assets associated with the retirement obligations have an indeterminate life 
we used an expected cash flow approach to measure our asset retirement obligations under sfas no 
the following amounts represent our asset retirement obligations on a pro forma basis as if we had adopted sfas no 
as of the respective dates december  in millions nuclear decommissioning jewett lignite mine total the net difference between the amounts determined under sfas no 
and our previous method of accounting for estimated nuclear decommissioning costs of million will be recorded as a liability 
the net difference between the amounts determined under sfas no 
and our previous method of accounting for estimated mine reclamation costs of million will be recorded as a cumulative effect of accounting change 
our rate regulated businesses have previously recognized removal costs as a component of depreciation expense in accordance with regulatory treatment 
as of december   these previously recognized removal costs of million do not represent sfas no 
asset retirement obligations  but rather embedded regulatory liabilities 
our non rate regulated businesses have also previously recognized removal costs as a component of depreciation expense 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 we will reverse million of previously recognized removal costs with respect to these non rate regulated businesses as a cumulative effect of accounting change 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas no 
provides new guidance on the recognition of impairment losses on long lived assets to be held and used or to be disposed of and also broadens the definition of what constitutes a discontinued operation and how the results of a discontinued operation are to be measured and presented 
sfas no 
supercedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  while retaining many of the requirements of these two statements 
under sfas no 
 assets held for sale that are a component of an entity will be included in discontinued operations if the operations and cash flows will be or have been eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity and the entity will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations prospectively 
sfas no 
was effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with early adoption encouraged 
sfas no 
did not materially change the methods we use to measure impairment losses on long lived assets  but may result in additional future dispositions being reported as discontinued operations than was previously permitted 
adoption of sfas no 
also resulted in the retroactive reclassification of our latin america operations as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we adopted sfas no 
on january  in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections sfas no 

sfas no 
eliminates the current requirement that gains and losses on debt extinguishment must be classified as extraordinary items in the income statement 
instead  such gains and losses will be classified as extraordinary items only if they are deemed to be unusual and infrequent 
sfas no

 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring eitf no 

the principal difference between sfas no 
and eitf no 
relates to the requirements for recognition of a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity 
sfas no 
requires that a liability be recognized for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity when it is incurred 
a liability is incurred when a transaction or event occurs that leaves an entity little or no discretion to avoid the future transfer or use of assets to settle the liability 
under eitf no 
 a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
in addition  sfas no 
also requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized at its fair value when it is incurred 
sfas no 
is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  with early application encouraged 
we will apply the provisions of sfas no 
to all exit  or disposal activities initiated after december  in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk impact of changes in interest rates and energy commodity prices we are exposed to various market risks 
these risks arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business and are inherent in our consolidated financial statements 
most of the revenues and income from our business activities are impacted by market risks 
categories of market risk include exposure to commodity prices through non trading activities  interest rates and equity prices 
a description of each market risk is set forth below commodity price risk results from exposures to changes in spot prices  forward prices and price volatilities of commodities  such as natural gas and other energy commodities risk 
interest rate risk primarily results from exposures to changes in the level of borrowings and changes in interest rates 
equity price risk results from exposures to changes in prices of individual equity securities 
management has established comprehensive risk management policies to monitor and manage these market risks 
we seek to manage these risk exposures through the implementation of our risk management policies and framework 
we seek to manage our exposures through the use of derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instrument contracts 
during the normal course of business  we review our hedging strategies and determine the hedging approach we deem appropriate based upon the circumstances of each situation 
derivative instruments such as futures  forward contracts  swaps and options derive their value from underlying assets  indices  reference rates or a combination of these factors 
these derivative instruments include negotiated contracts  which are referred to as over the counter derivatives  and instruments that are listed and traded on an exchange 
derivative transactions are entered into in our non trading operations to manage and hedge certain exposures  such as exposure to changes in gas prices 
we believe that the associated market risk of these instruments can best be understood relative to the underlying assets or risk being hedged 
interest rate risk we have outstanding long term debt  bank loans  mandatory redeemable preferred securities of subsidiary trusts holding solely our junior subordinated debentures trust preferred securities  securities held in our nuclear decommissioning trusts  some lease obligations and our obligations under the zens that subject us to the risk of loss associated with movements in market interest rates 
we utilize interest rate swaps in order to hedge portions of our floating rate debt and to hedge a portion of the interest rate applicable to future offerings of long term debt 
our floating rate obligations aggregated billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
if the floating interest rates were to increase by from december  rates  our combined interest expense would increase by a total of million each month in which such increase continued 
at december  and  we had outstanding fixed rate debt excluding indexed debt securities and trust preferred securities aggregating billion and billion  respectively  in principal amount and having a fair value of billion and billion  respectively 
these instruments are fixed rate and  therefore  do not expose us to the risk of loss in earnings due to changes in market interest rates please read notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
however  the fair value of these instruments would increase by approximately million if interest rates were to decline by from their levels at december  in general  such an increase in fair value would impact earnings and cash flows only if we were to reacquire all or a portion of these instruments in the open market prior to their maturity 
as discussed in note f to our consolidated financial statements  we contributed million in each of and to a trust established to fund our share of the decommissioning costs for the south texas project 
in  we contributed million to this trust 
the securities held by the trust for decommissioning costs had an estimated fair value of million as of december   of which approximately were fixed rate debt securities that subject us to risk of loss of fair value with movements in market interest rates 
if interest rates were to increase by from their levels at december   the decrease in fair value of the fixed rate debt securities would be approximately million 
in addition  the risk of an economic loss is mitigated 
any unrealized gains or losses are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
as a regulatory asset liability because we believe that our future contributions  which are currently recovered through the ratemaking process  will be adjusted for these gains and losses 
for further discussion regarding the recovery of decommissioning costs pursuant to the texas electric restructuring law  please read note a to our consolidated financial statements 
as discussed in note b to our consolidated financial statements  cerc corp 
s million aggregate principal amount of term enhanced remarketable securities term notes include an embedded option to remarket the securities 
the option is expected to be exercised in the event that the ten year treasury rate in is below 
at december   we could terminate the option at a cost of million 
a decrease of in the december  level of interest rates would increase the cost of terminating the option by approximately million 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  upon adoption of sfas no 
effective january   the zens obligation was bifurcated into a debt component and a derivative component 
the debt component of million at december  is a fixed rate obligation and  therefore  does not expose us to the risk of loss in earnings due to changes in market interest rates 
however  the fair value of the debt component would increase by approximately million if interest rates were to decline by from levels at december  changes in the fair value of the derivative component  million at december   are recorded in our statements of consolidated operations and  therefore  we are exposed to changes in the fair value of the derivative component as a result of changes in the underlying risk free interest rate 
if the risk free interest rate were to increase by from december  levels  the fair value of the derivative component would increase by approximately million  which would be recorded as an unrealized loss in our statements of consolidated operations 
as of december   we had interest rate swaps having an aggregate notional amount of million to fix the interest rate applicable to floating rate debt 
at december   the swaps relating to floating rate debt could be terminated at a cost of million 
the swaps relating to short term debt do not qualify as cash flow hedges under sfas no 
 and are marked to market in our consolidated balance sheets with changes reflected in interest expense in the statements of consolidated operations 
a decrease of in the december  level of interest rates would increase the cost of terminating the swaps outstanding at december  by approximately million 
during  we settled our forward starting interest rate swaps having an aggregate notional amount of billion at a cost of million 
for information regarding the accounting for interest rate swaps  please read note to our consolidated financial statements 
equity market value risk we are exposed to equity market value risk through our ownership of million shares of aol tw common  which are held by us to facilitate our ability to meet our obligations under the zens 
please read note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the effect of adoption of sfas no 
on our zens obligation and our historical accounting treatment of our zens obligation 
a decrease of from the december  market value of aol tw common would result in a net loss of approximately million  which would be recorded as a loss in our statements of consolidated operations 
as discussed above under interest rate risk  we contribute to a trust established to fund our share of the decommissioning costs for the south texas project  which held debt and equity securities as of december  the equity securities expose us to losses in fair value 
if the market prices of the individual equity securities were to decrease by from their levels at december   the resulting loss in fair value of these securities would be approximately million 
currently  the risk of an economic loss is mitigated as discussed above under interest rate risk 
commodity price risk from non trading activities to reduce our commodity price risk from market fluctuations in the revenues derived from the sale of natural gas and related transportation  we enter into forward contracts  swaps and options non trading energy derivatives in order to hedge some expected purchases of natural gas and sales of natural gas a portion of which are firm commitments at the inception of the hedge 
non trading energy derivatives are also utilized to fix the price of future operational gas requirements 
we use derivative instruments as economic hedges to offset the commodity exposure inherent in our businesses 
the stand alone commodity risk created by these instruments  without regard to the offsetting effect of the underlying exposure these instruments are intended to hedge  is described below 
we measure the commodity risk of our non trading energy derivatives using a sensitivity analysis 
the sensitivity analysis performed on our non trading energy derivatives measures the potential loss in earnings based on a hypothetical movement in energy prices 
an increase of in the market prices of energy commodities from their december  levels would have decreased the fair value of our non trading energy derivatives by million 
a decrease of in the market prices of energy commodities from their december  levels would have decreased the fair value of our non trading energy derivatives by million 
the above analysis of the non trading energy derivatives utilized for hedging purposes does not include the favorable impact that the same hypothetical price movement would have on our physical purchases and sales of natural gas to which the hedges relate 
furthermore  the non trading energy derivative portfolio is managed to complement the physical transaction portfolio  reducing overall risks within limits 
therefore  the adverse impact to the fair value of the portfolio of non trading energy derivatives held for hedging purposes associated with the hypothetical changes in commodity prices referenced above would be offset by a favorable impact on the underlying hedged physical transactions  assuming the non trading energy derivatives are not closed out in advance of their expected term  the non trading energy derivatives continue to function effectively as hedges of the underlying risk  and as applicable  anticipated underlying transactions settle as expected 
if any of the above mentioned assumptions ceases to be true  a loss on the derivative instruments may occur  or the options might be worthless as determined by the prevailing market value on their termination or maturity date  whichever comes first 
non trading energy derivatives designated and effective as hedges  may still have some percentage which is not effective 
the change in value of the non trading energy derivatives that represents the ineffective component of the hedges is recorded in our results of operations 
during  we recognized a million loss as a result of the discontinuance of a cash flow hedge because it was no longer probable that the forecasted transaction would occur 
we have established a risk oversight committee  comprised of corporate and business segment officers  that oversees all commodity price and credit risk activities  including trading  marketing  risk management services and hedging activities 
the committee s duties are to establish commodity risk policies  allocate risk capital  approve trading of new products and commodities  monitor risk positions and ensure compliance with the risk management policies and procedures and trading limits established by our board of directors 
our policies prohibit the use of leveraged financial instruments 
a leveraged financial instrument  for this purpose  is a transaction involving a derivative whose financial impact will be based on an amount other than the notional amount or volume of the instrument
