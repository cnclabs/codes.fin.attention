item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations recent events on december   we announced that our board of directors approved a voluntary stock option exchange program the program for employees 
under the program  employees were offered the opportunity to exchange million outstanding stock options with exercise prices equal to or greater than per share for new stock options that will be granted at an exchange ratio determined by the date the exchanged stock options were granted 
participating employees  other than the chief executive officer ceo  will receive new stock options in exchange for outstanding stock options at an exchange ratio of either for  for  or for  depending on the grant date of the exchanged stock option 
the ceo will receive new stock options in exchange for outstanding stock options at an exchange ratio of for in accordance with the program  on january   we cancelled million of our outstanding stock options 
we expect to grant million new options to purchase shares of our common stock on july   which is the first business day that is six months and one day after the cancellation of the exchanged options 
the exercise price per share of the new options will be equal to the fair market value of our common stock at the close of regular trading on july  however  the exercise price per share of the new stock options granted to our officers will not be less than per share  which is percent of the average closing price of our common stock during the exchange offer period 
the new stock options represent approximately percent of the total shares of our common stock outstanding as of december   and could have a dilutive impact on our future earnings per share to the extent that the market price of our common stock exceeds the exercise price of the new stock options to be granted on july  see note  subsequent events  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
on november   we announced a restructuring program that included a workforce reduction  consolidation of excess facilities  and the restructuring of certain business functions 
as part of this restructuring program  we reduced our workforce  including certain officers  by approximately percent 
during our first quarter of fiscal  we expect to record a charge associated with these workforce reduction and other restructuring activities ranging from million to million see note  subsequent events  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
on november   we announced an agreement to acquire rhapsody  a privately held technology company based in fremont  california 
under the terms of the acquisition agreement  we will acquire all outstanding shares of rhapsody in exchange for  shares of our common stock 
in addition  we will issue up to an additional  shares of our common stock if the rhapsody business successfully completes specified product development milestones by november  the final purchase price of this acquisition cannot be determined until the closing date  which is expected to be in january see note  subsequent events  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth certain financial data for the periods indicated as a percentage of total net revenues fiscal year ended october  october  october  net revenues cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of deferred stock compensation facilities lease losses and other charges total operating expenses income from operations interest and other income  net interest expense gain loss on investments  net income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income revenues 
our revenues are derived primarily from sales of our silkworm family of products 
net revenues for the year ended october  were million  an increase of percent compared with net revenues of million for the year ended october  net revenues for the year ended october  represented an increase of percent over net revenues of million for the year ended october  the increases in net revenues reflect a general increased demand for san switching products  and are the result of increased unit sales offset by declines in average unit selling prices of our products 
revenue growth was negatively impacted by the continuing unfavorable economic conditions and reduced it spending environment that began in fiscal year we are unable to predict when the it spending environment will improve  if at all 
as a result  our growth rates may continue to be negatively impacted 
on november   we announced that we expect our revenues for the quarter ending january  to be between million and million  down approximately percent to percent from the previous quarter  and that we expect to break even in terms of earnings prior to restructuring and acquisition related charges 
the primary basis for this guidance was continued uncertainty in the it spending environment 
domestic and international revenues were approximately percent and percent of our total revenues  respectively  for the year ended october  for the year ended october   domestic and international revenues were approximately percent and percent of our total revenues  respectively  and for the year ended october   domestic and international revenues were approximately percent and percent of our total revenues  respectively 
revenues are attributed to geographic areas based on the location of the customer to which our products are shipped 
international revenues primarily consisted of sales to customers in western europe and the greater asia pacific region 
included in domestic revenues are sales to certain oem customers who take possession of our products domestically and then distribute these 
table of contents products to their international customers 
our mix of international and domestic revenue can therefore vary depending on the relative mix of sales to certain oem customers 
a significant portion of our revenue is concentrated among a relatively small number of customers 
for the year ended october   three customers each represented greater than ten percent of our total revenues for a combined total of percent of our total revenues 
for the year ended october   three customers each represented greater than ten percent of our total revenues for a combined total of percent of our total revenues  and for the year ended october   two customers each represented greater than ten percent of our total revenues for a combined total of percent of our total revenues 
we expect that a significant portion of our future revenues will continue to come from sales of products to a relatively small number of customers 
therefore  the loss of any one significant customer  or a decrease in the level of sales to any one significant customer  could seriously harm our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  during fiscal year  hp and compaq  two of our significant oem customers  merged 
we are unable to predict the impact this merger may have on our business 
while to date the impact of this merger has not been material  it is possible that  as a result of this merger  sales of our products to the combined company could be disrupted or decline 
gross margin 
gross margin for the year ended october   was percent compared to percent and percent for the years ended october   and october   respectively 
the increases were primarily due to lower component and manufacturing costs and the allocation of fixed manufacturing costs over a greater revenue base  partially offset by decreases in the average unit selling prices of our products 
gross margin for the year ended october  was adversely impacted by a higher annual rate of decline in average unit selling prices than in prior years 
gross margin for the year ended october  was adversely affected by charges of million primarily associated with the accrual of purchase commitments for excess inventory components used in the manufacture of our gbit sec related products as a result of an accelerated transition of our product offerings from to gbit sec technology 
we currently anticipate that gross margin in fiscal year will decrease from historical levels  primarily resulting from increasing competitive pricing pressures 
other factors that may adversely affect our gross margin include  but are not limited to  product mix  specifically growth in the entry level product market which has historically consisted of lower margin products  and our ability to maintain our historical component and manufacturing cost reduction rates 
research and development expenses 
research and development r d expenses increased to million for the year ended october   compared with million and million for the years ended october   and october   respectively 
r d expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel engaged in engineering and r d activities  fees paid to consultants and outside service providers  nonrecurring engineering charges  prototyping expenses related to the design  development  testing and enhancement of our products  depreciation related to engineering and test equipment  and it and facilities expenses 
the increases in r d expenses  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues  reflect our belief that continued investment in research and development is a critical factor in maintaining our competitive position 
we currently anticipate that r d expenses in fiscal year will increase in absolute dollars principally as a result of incremental spending associated with our anticipated acquisition of rhapsody 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million for the year ended october   compared with million and million for the years ended october   and october   respectively 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing and sales  costs associated with promotional and travel expenses  and it and facilities expenses 
the increases in sales and marketing expenses were primarily due to the expansion of our sales and marketing organizations  and increased direct selling expenses  principally commissions  associated with increased revenues 
we believe that continued investment in sales and marketing is critical to the success of our strategy to expand relationships with our distribution partners  including oem partners  value added distributors  systems integrators  and value added resellers  to communicate with  understand  and anticipate the current and future needs of the end users of our products in order 
table of contents to increase demand for our partners  and to maintain our leadership position in the san market 
we currently anticipate that sales and marketing expenses in fiscal year will increase in absolute dollars 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative g a expenses increased to million for the year ended october   compared with million and million for the years ended october   and october   respectively 
g a expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for corporate executives  finance  human resources and investor relations  as well as recruiting expenses  professional fees  corporate legal expenses  other corporate expenses  and it and facilities expenses 
the increases in g a expenses were primarily due to additional headcount and other expenses necessary to manage and support increased levels of business activity 
we currently anticipate that g a expenses in fiscal year will increase in absolute dollars 
amortization of deferred stock compensation 
in connection with the grant of certain stock options to employees during the year ended october   we recorded deferred stock compensation of million 
no additional deferred stock compensation was recorded during the years ended october   october   and october  deferred stock compensation is amortized over the vesting periods of the applicable options 
for each of the years ended october   october   and october   we recorded amortization of deferred stock compensation of million  million  and million  respectively 
facilities lease losses and other charges 
during the year ended october   we experienced the impact of unfavorable economic conditions and a reduction in it spending rates 
as a result  during the fourth quarter ended october   we performed a comprehensive analysis of our real estate facility requirements and identified vacant excess facilities space  which was subsequently offered for sublease 
factors considered in the analysis included  but were not limited to  anticipated future revenue growth rates  anticipated future headcount requirements in terms of both headquarters and field personnel  anticipated sublease terms  anticipated time to sublease  and anticipated future operating expenses based upon then current market conditions 
based upon the results of this analysis and the excess facilities space identified  during the fourth quarter ended october   we recorded a charge of million related to estimated facilities lease losses  net of expected sublease income  and the impairment of certain related assets see note  liabilities associated with facilities lease losses and asset impairment charges  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the facilities lease losses and related asset impairment charges were estimates and represented the low end of an estimated range that may be adjusted upon the occurrence of future triggering events 
triggering events may include  but are not limited to  changes in estimated time to sublease the facilities  sublease terms  and sublease rates 
during the quarter ended july   we completed a transaction to sublease a portion of these vacant facilities 
accordingly  based upon the most recent market data  we revised certain estimates and assumptions  including those related to expected sublease rates  estimated time to sublease the facilities  expected future operating costs  and expected future use of the facilities 
no material adjustments were made to the facilities lease losses reserve as a result of these revised estimates and assumptions 
as of october   no additional adjustments had been made to the estimated facilities lease losses reserve 
should there be changes in real estate market conditions or should it take longer than expected to find a suitable tenant to sublease the remaining vacant facilities  adjustments to the facilities lease losses reserve may be necessary in future periods based upon then current actual events and circumstances 
also during the fourth quarter ended october   as a result of an accelerated transition of our product offerings from to gbit sec technology  we recorded a charge of million primarily related to the impairment of certain gbit sec related equipment no longer used in research and development and sales and marketing efforts see note  liabilities associated with facilities lease losses and asset impairment charges  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest and other income  net 
net interest and other income increased to million for the year ended october   compared with million for the year ended october   and million for 
table of contents the year ended october  these increases were primarily the result of increased cash  cash equivalent and investment balances  partially offset by declining interest rates 
the increase in cash balances was attributed to cash generated from operations and the proceeds from the million in aggregate principal amount of percent convertible subordinated notes due that we issued in december and january see note  convertible subordinated debt  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest expense 
interest expense was million for the year ended october   and primarily represents the interest cost associated with our convertible subordinated notes 
gain loss on investments  net 
net gain on investments for the year ended october  resulted from the sale of united states government agency debt securities 
net loss on investments for the year ended october  consisted of impairment losses on minority equity investments in non publicly traded companies of million  partially offset by realized gains from sales of marketable equity securities of million 
as of october   we had net unrealized holding gains of million associated with our remaining investment portfolio 
we have made certain minority equity investments in non publicly traded companies that develop technology or provide services that are complementary to or broaden the markets for our products  and to promote our business and strategic objectives 
minority equity investments in non public companies are included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets  are carried at cost  and are accounted for under the cost method 
we hold less than percent of the voting equity of such companies and neither have nor seek control or significant influence over the respective companies operating and financial policies 
we monitor our investments for impairment on a quarterly basis and make appropriate reductions in carrying values when such impairment is determined to be other than temporary 
factors used in determining an impairment include  but are not limited to  the current business environment including competition and uncertainty of financial condition  going concern considerations such as the rate at which the investee company utilizes cash to finance overhead  and the investee company s inability to obtain additional private financing to fulfill its stated business plan  the need for changes to the investee company s existing business model due to changing business environments and its ability to successfully implement necessary changes  and comparable valuations 
if an investment is determined to be impaired  a determination is made as to whether such impairment is other than temporary 
during the year ended october   we made minority equity investments in non publicly traded companies of million 
our investments were made primarily in companies in the storage networking  internet infrastructure  fabless semiconductor  networking services  and managed storage services industries 
these companies were  and continue to be  development stage companies with significant risks 
during the year ended october   the industries in which these companies compete experienced considerable market declines associated with a depressed macroeconomic environment 
many of these companies had spent the majority of their funding on operating activities and or lost key business partners due to bankruptcy  and we determined that the carrying value of our investments were impaired 
based upon the then current market conditions and substantial doubt about these companies ability to raise additional funding  achieve positive cash flow  and achieve projected revenues  we concluded the impairments were other than temporary and recorded impairment charges of million 
the impairment charges reduced the carrying value of our investments to the estimated fair value 
no impairment charges were recorded during the year ended october  the carrying value of our minority equity investments in non publicly traded companies at both october  and october   was million 
if the companies with whom we have remaining investments are unable to raise additional capital  or if the results of operations and financial condition of these companies continue to decline  and market conditions do not improve  we may incur additional impairment charges in our investment portfolio in the future 
provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rate was percent for the year ended october   compared with percent and percent for the years ended october   and october   respectively 
our effective tax rates have historically differed from the federal statutory rate for various reasons see note  income taxes  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
for the year ended october   our effective tax rate was significantly higher than the federal statutory rate primarily due to 
table of contents the inability to benefit certain losses on minority equity investments in non publicly traded companies 
our ability to maintain our current effective tax rate requires that international revenues and earnings as a percentage of total revenues and earnings be consistent with historical levels 
to the extent that international revenues and earnings differ from those historically achieved  a factor largely influenced by the buying behavior of our oem partners  or unfavorable changes in tax laws and regulations occur  our tax rate could change 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments were million as of october   an increase of million over the prior year amount of million 
for the year ended october   we generated million in cash from operating activities  primarily from net income before depreciation and amortization 
also included in cash from operations were income tax benefits of million related to employee stock option transactions  offset by a million increase in deferred tax assets 
as of october   we had million in net deferred tax assets  which we believe will be realizable through future profitable operations 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended october  totaled million and was primarily the result of million in net purchases of short and long term investments and million invested in capital equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended october  totaled million  and resulted from million in net proceeds from the issuance of convertible subordinated notes  and million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to employee participation in employee stock programs 
net proceeds from the issuance of common stock related to employee participation in employee stock programs have historically been a significant component of our liquidity 
the extent to which our employees participate in these programs generally increases or decreases based upon changes in the market price of our common stock 
as a result  our cash flow resulting from the issuance of common stock related to employee participation in employee stock programs will vary 
as a result of our recent voluntary stock options exchange program  during fiscal year  we do not expect to generate significant cash flow from the issuance of common stock related to the employee participation in employee stock programs 
we have a manufacturing agreement with solectron under which we provide to solectron a twelve month product forecast and place purchase orders with solectron sixty calendar days in advance of the scheduled delivery of products to our customers 
as of october   our commitment to solectron for such inventory components was million  net of purchase commitment reserves of million  which we expect to utilize during future normal ongoing operations 
although the purchase orders we place with solectron are cancelable  the terms of the agreement require us to purchase from solectron all inventory components not returnable or usable by other solectron customers 
in addition  we purchase several key components used in the manufacture of our products 
as of october   we had non cancelable purchase commitments for various components totaling million  net of purchase commitment reserves of million  which we expect to utilize during future normal ongoing operations 
on december   and january   we sold million in aggregate principal amount of percent convertible subordinated notes due see note  convertible subordinated debt  of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
holders of the notes may  in whole or in part  convert the notes into shares of our common stock at a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes aggregate of approximately million shares at any time prior to maturity on january  at any 
table of contents time on or after january   we may redeem the notes in whole or in part at the following prices expressed as a percentage of the principal amount redemption period price beginning on january  and ending on december  beginning on january  and ending on december  on january  we are required to pay interest on january and july of each year  beginning july  debt issuance costs of million are being amortized over the term of the notes 
the amortization of debt issuance costs will accelerate upon early redemption or conversion of the notes 
the net proceeds remain available for general corporate purposes  including working capital and capital expenditures 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations including interest expense and commitments as of october  in thousands less than after total year years years contractual obligations convertible subordinated notes  including interest non cancelable operating leases unconditional purchase obligations  gross total contractual obligations other commitments standby letters of credit  n a n a n a we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term investments  and cash expected to be generated from future operations will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements at least through the next months  although we could elect to seek additional funding prior to that time  if available 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of revenue growth  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts and the expansion of sales and marketing  the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products  and the market acceptance of our products

aggregate fees billed to us by wsgr for legal services rendered  including general corporate counseling  litigation services  merger and acquisition related services  and services related to our convertible debt offering  during the years ended october   october   and october   were million  million  and million  respectively

we believe that sales to veritas were on terms no more favorable than those with unrelated parties 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally 
table of contents accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate  on an on going basis  our estimates and judgments  including those related to sales returns  bad debts  excess inventory and purchase commitments  investments  warranty obligations  lease losses  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the methods  estimates  and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our consolidated financial statements 
the sec considers an entity s most critical accounting policies to be those policies that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations  and those that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain at the time of estimation 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  require significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  warranty reserves  and allowances for sales returns and doubtful accounts  inventory and purchase commitment reserves  lease losses  and accounting for income taxes 
product revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
however  revenue recognition is deferred for shipments to new customers and for shipments to existing customers when significant support services are required to successfully integrate our products into our customer s products 
these revenues  and related costs  are deferred and recognized when the customer has successfully integrated our products into its product offerings  and we have met any support obligations 
in addition  revenue from sales to master resellers is recognized upon reported sell through 
service revenue  which to date has not been material  consists of training  warranty  and maintenance arrangements  including post contract customer support pcs services 
pcs services are offered under renewable  annual fee based contracts or as part of multiple element arrangements and typically include upgrades and enhancements to our software operating system  and telephone support 
for multiple element arrangements  we allocate revenue to each element based upon vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of the element or application of the residual method 
vsoe of the fair value for an element is based upon the price charged when the element is sold separately 
service revenue  including revenue allocated to undelivered elements  is deferred and recognized ratably over the contractual period 
service contracts are typically one to three years in length 
training revenue is recognized upon completion of the training 
we provide warranties on our products ranging from one to three years 
we accrue for warranty costs and reduce revenue for estimated sales returns and other allowances at the time of shipment 
a provision for estimated future costs relating to warranty expense is recorded as cost of revenues when revenue is recorded 
warranty costs  sales returns and other allowances are estimated based upon historical experience 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms and practices when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances and charges against earnings may be required 
to date  actual experience has been consistent with our estimates 
we write down inventory and record purchase commitment reserves for estimated excess and obsolete inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated fair value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
although we strive to ensure the accuracy of our 
table of contents forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and commitments  and our reported results 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected  additional inventory write downs  purchase commitment reserves  and charges against earnings might be required 
to date actual experience has been consistent with our estimates 
as a result of continuing unfavorable economic conditions and a reduction in it spending rates  during the quarter ended october   we performed a comprehensive analysis of our real estate facilities requirements and identified vacant excess facility space  which was subsequently offered for sublease 
based upon the results of this analysis  during the quarter ended october   we recorded a charge of million related to estimated facilities lease losses  net of expected sublease income  and a charge of million in connection with the impairment of certain related leasehold improvements 
in determining the net facilities lease losses and related asset impairment charges  various assumptions were made  including the time period over which the facilities will be vacant  expected sublease terms  expected sublease rates  anticipated future operating expenses  and expected future use of the facilities 
the estimated charges represented the low end of an estimated range that may be adjusted upon the occurrence of future triggering events 
triggering events may include  but are not limited to  changes in estimated time to sublease the facilities  sublease terms  and sublease rates 
during the year ended october   we completed a transaction to sublease a portion of these vacant facilities 
accordingly  based upon the most recent market data  we revised certain estimates and assumptions used to calculate our reserves for facilities lease losses and related asset impairment charges  including those related to expected sublease rates  estimated time to sublease the facilities  expected future operating costs  and expected future use of the facilities 
no material adjustments were made to the facilities lease losses reserve as a result of these estimates and assumptions 
should there be further changes in real estate market conditions or should it take longer than expected to find a suitable tenant to sublease the remaining vacant facilities  adjustments to the facilities lease losses reserve may be necessary in future periods based upon then current actual events and circumstances 
the determination of our tax provision is subject to judgments and estimates due to operations in several tax jurisdictions outside the united states 
sales to our international customers are principally taxed at rates that are lower than united states rates  resulting in a reduction of our effective tax rate 
the ability to maintain our current effective tax rate is contingent upon existing tax laws in both the united states and in the respective countries in which our international subsidiaries are located 
future changes in domestic or international tax laws could affect the continued realization of the tax benefits we are currently receiving and expect to receive from international sales 
in addition  a decrease in the percentage of our total revenue from international customers or in the mix of international revenue among particular tax jurisdictions could change our overall effective tax rate 
also  our current effective tax rate assumes that united states income taxes are not provided for undistributed earnings of certain non united states subsidiaries 
these earnings could become subject to united states federal and state income taxes and foreign withholding taxes  as applicable  should they be either deemed or actually remitted from our international subsidiaries to the united states 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets  which is made up primarily of income tax deductions and credits resulting from stock option exercises  assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future income to fully utilize these tax deductions and credits 
if we do not generate sufficient future income  the realization of these deferred tax assets may be impaired resulting in additional income tax expense 
we evaluate the expected realization of our deferred tax assets and assess the need for valuation allowances quarterly

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and equity security prices 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk due to changes in the general level of united states interest rates relates primarily to our cash equivalents and short term and long term investment portfolios 
our cash  cash equivalents  and short term and long term investments are primarily maintained at four major financial institutions in the united states 
as of october   we did not hold any derivative instruments 
the primary objective of our investment activities is the preservation of principal while maximizing investment income and minimizing risk 
the following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair values of our investments in debt securities issued by united states government agencies as of october  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates in thousands valuation of securities valuation of securities given an interest rate fair value given an interest rate decrease of x basis points as of increase of x basis points october  issuer bps bps bps bps bps bps us government agency debt securities these instruments are not leveraged and are classified as available for sale 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from selected potential changes in interest rates 
market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points bps  bps  and bps  which are representative of the historical movements in the federal funds rate 
the following table in thousands presents our cash equivalents and short term and long term investments subject to interest rate risk and their related weighted average interest rates at october  carrying value approximates fair value 
average amount interest rate cash and cash equivalents short term investments long term investments total our convertible subordinated debt is subject to a fixed interest rate and the notes are based on a fixed conversion ratio into common stock 
therefore  we are not exposed to changes in interest rates related to our long term debt instruments 
the notes are not listed on any securities exchange or included in any automated quotation system  however  the notes are eligible for trading on the portal sm market 
on october   the average bid and ask price on the portal market of our convertible subordinated notes due was  resulting in an aggregate fair value of approximately million 
our common stock is quoted on the nasdaq national market under the symbol brcd 
on october   the last reported sale price of our common stock on the nasdaq national market was per share 
equity security price risk our exposure to market risk due to equity security price fluctuations primarily relates to investments in marketable equity securities 
these investments are principally in companies in the volatile high technology sector 
we do not attempt to reduce or eliminate the market exposure on these securities 
adverse changes in equity prices of percent  percent  and percent would result in decreases of approximately   and  in the fair value of marketable equity securities at october   respectively
