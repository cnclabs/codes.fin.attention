overview we are a leading designer  manufacturer and marketer of medical products 
many of our products are single patient use airway products 
our products address the anesthesia and respiratory critical care markets as well as the sleep personal ventilation markets and the pharmaceutical technology services market 
see note to the financial statements for segment information 
in fiscal  we classified our vital pharma business as a discontinued operation

total we sell our products in over countries worldwide 
in the us  we sell most of our anesthesia and respiratory critical care products primarily to hospitals using our direct sales force and certain major health care distributors 
outside of the us  most of our anesthesia and respiratory critical care sales have been made through a strategic alliance agreement with a medical device manufacturer  rusch gmbh 
our sleep ventilation products are sold primarily outside of the us through our direct sales force and country specific distributors 
we compensate our direct sales force principally though salary and commission payments  included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
sales to distributors are made at our established price 
when the distributor provides us with documentation verifying that the product has been shipped to an end user that is entitled to a price lower than our established price  we owe the distributor a rebate equal to the difference between our established price and the lower price to which that end user is entitled 
the allowance for rebates is recorded at the time the company records the revenue for the product sold to the distributor 
we record this sales rebate allowance as a reduction of gross revenue 
recent acquisitions as part of our strategic plan to expand significantly into the obstructive sleep apnea field  we acquired our interests in our breas medical ab and sleep services of america subsidiaries through a series of transactions over a period of several years breas medical ab during the period from november through may   we acquired a ownership stake in breas for million 
on may   we purchased an additional of breas from two minority shareholders  for an initial payment of million  with an earnout based on a formula of sales and profits 
the final earnout payment to the two minority shareholders for the additional  totaling million  was made in april our final purchase  amounting to million  for the remaining of the minority interest in breas was completed in april the total purchase price for breas was approximately million 
we accounted for our equity ownership in breas under the equity accounting method for the fiscal year ended september  and for the first eight months of the following fiscal year 
we reported our proportionate share of breas net income of  in fiscal and  in fiscal in other income expense 
once we acquired a controlling position  we included all of breas results in our consolidated financial statements for the four months ended september   consisting of net revenue of million and income before minority interest of  and for all subsequent periods 
the portion of breas that we did not own was recorded as a minority interest  reducing our net income for each reporting period 
as part of the settlement of the earnout agreement with one of the minority shareholders  who was also the former chief executive officer of breas  breas acquired the former chief executive officer s ownership interest in sprl percussionaire 
the purchase price for that interest is included in the million payment 
to complete the purchase of sprl percussionaire additional payments in the form of an earnout agreement were to be made to the founder of sprl percussionaire  and we accrued an amount due of  in september in fiscal breas entered into a settlement agreement with the founder of sprl percussionaire and terminated this earnout agreement obligation 
sleep services of america in june through may  we purchased million of common stock and convertible preferred stock of national sleep technologies  a company engaged in the operation of diagnostic sleep centers 
in june  we converted our preferred stock into common stock of national sleep technologies  at that point  we owned of the common stock 
on january   our national sleep technologies business was merged with hsi medical services corporation  a subsidiary of the johns hopkins health system corporation  to form sleep services of america 
no cash was contributed at that time 
instead  we received a equity interest in sleep services of america  an affiliate of johns hopkins health system corporation received a equity interest in sleep services of america and the other minority shareholders of national sleep technologies received a interest in sleep services of america 
subsequent to the merger  we paid  to certain of the minority shareholders to increase our ownership to  and reduce the minority ownership to 
initially  we reported our interest in national sleep technologies under the equity accounting method 
as a result  our share of national sleep technologies losses of  in fiscal   in fiscal  and  in fiscal was included in our other income expenses for our fiscal years and and for the first eight months of fiscal when we converted our preferred stock investment into common stock  we began consolidating the results of national sleep technologies in our consolidated financial statements

see results of operations for fiscal and revenue and operating income information 
stelex tvg on march   we acquired stelex inc for million in cash 
stelex was a private company which  like our subsidiary  the validation group  inc  was engaged in regulatory compliance counseling 
we structured the transaction as a merger of stelex into the validation group  renamed the surviving corporation stelex the validation group  inc and accounted for the transaction as a purchase 
the subsidiary now operates under the name stelex  inc critical accounting principles and estimates we have identified the following critical accounting principles that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to asset impairment  revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  and contingencies and litigation 
we state these accounting policies in the notes to our consolidated financial statements and at relevant places in this discussion and analysis 
these estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could vary from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting principles affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements through september   we amortized goodwill and intangibles on a straight line basis over their estimated lives 
upon our adoption of sfas no 
on october   we ceased amortizing goodwill and we perform an annual impairment analysis based upon discounted cash flows to assess the recoverability of the goodwill  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
we completed this impairment test during the three month period ended march  and found no impairment 
if we are required to record impairment charges in the future  it would have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments  which results in bad debt expense 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was  at september  and  at september  we determine the adequacy of this allowance by evaluating individual customer receivables  considering the customer s financial condition and credit history and analyzing current economic conditions 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
our sales to us distributors are made at our established price 
each distributor subsequently provides us with documentation that our products have been shipped to particular end users ie particular hospitals 
in general  the end user is entitled  on a case by case basis  to a price lower than our established price 
accordingly  we owe the distributor a rebate the difference between the established price and the lower price to which the end user is entitled upon our receipt of the documentation from the distributor 
at the time that the distributor remits payment to us for the products purchased  the distributor deducts an amount for the related rebates 
the allowance for rebates is recorded at the time we record the revenue for the product shipped to the distributor 
the rebate is recorded as sales allowance reducing gross revenue 
for several years  we utilized an historical moving average to estimate the allowance for rebates 
based upon a review conducted in connection with our filing of our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended march   we concluded that the moving average estimate does not necessarily result in the appropriate liability due to the distributor 
accordingly  we have changed our method of estimating rebate claims to record the allowance for rebates based upon the documentation provided by the distributor adjusting from estimate to actual at the time of remittance 
we are subject to various claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of our business 
these matters frequently arise in disputes regarding the rights to intellectual property  where it is difficult to assess the likelihood of success and even more difficult to assess the probable ranges of recovery 
although we currently are not aware of any legal proceeding that is reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations  if we become aware of any such claims against us  we will evaluate the probability of an adverse outcome and provide accruals for such contingencies as necessary 
we have established an allowance for inventory obsolescence 
the allowance was determined by performing an aging analysis of the inventory  based upon this review  inventory is stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or its net realizable value 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the company wrote off certain inventory amounting to  our inventory allowance for obsolescence was  at september  and  at september  accounting principles

cost of goods sold and services performed increased from million for the year ended september  to million for the year ended september  cost of goods sold increased  from million for the year ended september  to million for the year ended september  the million increase results primarily from an increase of approximately million at our breas subsidiary due to foreign exchange rate changes  the write off of certain inventory amounting to million resulting from our continuing evaluation of inventory  and  representing a twelve month volume related expense adjustment from a supplier 
these increases were partially offset by approximately  of savings realized from cost improvement projects at our new jersey and colorado plants 
cost of services performed increased  from million for the year ended september  to million for the year ended september   reflecting the increased pharmaceutical technology outsourcing services achieved with the acquisition of stelex inc in the second quarter of fiscal and the increased volume in sleep services revenue resulting from the merger in the second quarter of fiscal of our national sleep technologies subsidiary with the johns hopkins health system subsidiary 
gross profit 
our gross profit increased  from million for the year ended september  to million for the year ended september  our overall gross profit margin was for the year ended september  and for the year ended september  in addition to the items noted above in cost of goods sold and cost of services  the decrease in gross margin percentage primarily reflects the increase in rebate expense see note to the consolidated financial statements  charges for the write off of certain inventory see note to the consolidated financial statements and  to a lesser extent  the lower gross margin realized from a change in mix attributable to the increase in revenues of our sleep and pharmaceutical technology services segments  which operate at a lower gross margin
