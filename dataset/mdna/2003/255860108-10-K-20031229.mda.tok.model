us consumer accounted for the majority of this net improvement  as the company s manufacturing consolidation efforts led to significantly improved gross margins 
higher revenues and a decrease of approximately  in interest costs also contributed to the us improvement 
foreign consumer operating income also improved in all geographic areas due principally to higher gross margins from lower pencil raw materials costs and improved manufacturing overhead efficiencies 
vs 
income before taxes  minority interest and discontinued operations decreased  restructuring costs increased  as the company announced its final phase of plant consolidations 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
administrative costs in the us increased primarily due to higher bank financing costs and the prior year administrative expenses reflecting a  reduction for settlement of a lawsuit 
higher administrative expenses were partially offset by lower interest costs as interest expense decreased  in revenues revenues in increased  over the prior year 
the changes are as follows decrease increase decrease in thousands total volume price mix us  foreign  us revenue increased primarily in the educational market 
foreign revenue decreases were primarily in mexico where an approximate reduction in the value of the peso resulted in a decline of approximately million 
this decrease was partially offset by mexico price increases  an increase in the value of the canadian dollar and higher volume in europe 
overall revenues increased  from the prior year 
the changes are as follows increase decrease increase decrease in thousands total volume price mix us  foreign  us revenue decreased in the educational and promotional products markets primarily due to customer consolidations and their related inventory reduction efforts 
revenue increased in the retail channel  principally in the office supply superstores  partially offsetting reductions in other channels 
foreign revenue increased primarily in mexico due to higher volume with existing mass market customers and additional government business 
while the company has operations in canada  mexico and the uk  historically only the operating results in mexico have been materially impacted by currency fluctuations 
there has been a significant devaluation of the mexican peso at least once in each of the last three decades  the last one being in august of in the short term after such devaluations  consumer confidence has been shaken  leading to an immediate reduction in revenues in the months following the devaluation 
then  after the immediate shock  and as the peso stabilizes  revenues tend to grow 
selling prices tend to rise over the long term to offset any inflationary increases in costs 
the peso  as well as any currency value  depends on many factors including international trade  investor confidence and government policy  to name a few 
these factors are impossible for the company to predict  and thus  an estimate of potential effect on results of operations for the future cannot be made 
this currency risk in mexico is presently managed through occasional foreign currency hedges  local currency financing and by export sales to the us denominated in us dollars 
operating income in  operating income increased  as compared to the prior year

the reduction was principally due to lower sales and marketing salaries and related expenses  reflecting recent cost reduction activities 
foreign operating profit increased  as savings from consolidation efforts in mexico and lower raw material costs and increased production resulted in higher profits in china 
all of the aforementioned manufacturing efficiencies and costs savings contributed to a decrease in overall consolidated cost of sales of revenues as compared to in the prior year 
operating income decreased  in from the prior year 
us operating income decreased  excluding restructuring charges due to the aforementioned lower revenues and increased administrative costs 
us administrative costs also increased principally due to the prior year reflecting a reduction for legal settlements of  and significantly higher bank financing costs approximately 
these factors were primarily responsible for an increase in selling and administrative costs of sales as compared to of sales in the prior year 
restructuring and related costs increased  as the company announced its final phase of its consolidation plan

current economic environment and events although not directly impacted by recent events in the us and abroad  management believes that softening economic conditions have recently affected and could continue to affect the retail mass or other markets served by the company s consumer group and thus could lead to reduced overall revenues 
in addition  certain expenses which have risen recently such as insurance costs could continue to trend significantly higher in the coming years due to recent events 
liquidity and capital resources despite significantly improved results from operations  the company s cash flows used in operating activities approximated  in fiscal the company has generated annual cash flows from operating activities exceeding million on average for the previous three fiscal years 
after significant prior year reductions in inventories from its strict inventory management plan  the company did not significantly reduce inventories in  except from the sale of its new castle refractories division 
certain safety stock levels were increased as new manufacturing processes were implemented in mexico 
however  the company did extinguish certain significant liabilities aggregating approximately million in consisting principally of deferred interest and restructuring charges 
cash flows from accounts receivable also decreased approximately million in due to large mexico government sales late in the fiscal year having payment terms extending beyond september  the company s investing activities provided approximately million in cash flows as compared with when million in cash flows were used for purchase of plant and equipment  net of the effects of disposals 
major capital projects are discretionary in nature with no material purchase commitments 
capital expenditures are usually funded from operations and existing lending and leasing arrangements 
in  the company s net capital expenditures were only  due to shrinking manufacturing facilities 
cash flows were provided from the sale of the aforementioned division assets and proceeds from the sale of securities received from insurance company demutualizations 
in october  the company completed a financing agreement with a new senior lender and its existing subordinated lenders to restructure its present us debt through fiscal foothill capital corporation provided a three year million senior debt facility which replaced the company s previous senior debt with a consortium of lenders 
the new senior debt arrangement provided approximately million in increased working capital liquidity for operations and to make certain subordinated debt payments 
the senior debt facility includes a million revolving loan  which bears interest at either the prime rate at september   plus  or the prevailing libor rate approximately at september   plus 
borrowings under the revolving loan are based upon of eligible us and canada accounts receivable  as defined  of certain accounts receivable having extended payment terms  and varying advance rates for us and canada raw materials and finished goods inventories 
the facility also includes term loans aggregating an initial amount of million  which bear interest at either the prime rate  plus  or the prevailing libor rate  plus 
these loans are payable in monthly installments of  plus interest  with the balance due in a balloon payment in october the loan agreement also contains restrictions regarding the payment of dividends as well as subordinated debt payments discussed below  a requirement to maintain a minimum level of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization and net worth and a limitation on the amount of annual capital expenditures 
to better balance and manage overall interest rate exposure  the company previously executed an interest rate swap agreement that effectively fixed the rate of interest on million of its senior debt at through august these financing arrangements are collateralized by the tangible and intangible assets of the us and canada operations including accounts receivable  inventories  property  plant and equipment  patents and trademarks and a guarantee by and pledge of capital stock of the company s subsidiaries 
as of september   the company had approximately million of unused lines of credit available 
in october  the company also reached agreement with the holders of million of senior subordinated notes to restructure the notes  extending the maturity date to the company is only required to pay monthly installments of  through december and  per month from january through the maturity date 
however  the company paid million in principal and million of accrued interest at closing of the new senior debt facility and made additional payments to its subordinated lenders of approximately million in fiscal payments to the subordinated lenders are subject to certain restrictions imposed under the senior debt facility 
interest on the balance of subordinated debt is paid quarterly 
if the company is unable to make scheduled and additional excess payments totaling at least million by due to restrictions imposed under the new senior debt facility or otherwise the noteholders will receive warrants equivalent to approximately of the diluted common shares outstanding for each million in unpaid principal 
the company made sufficient payments in fiscal and expects to do so in fiscal to avoid the issuance of any such warrants  at least through that date 
any warrants received or earned will be relinquished if the notes are paid in full during the term of the new agreement 
the agreement also grants the subordinated lenders a lien on company assets junior in all aspects to the new senior debt collateral agreements described above 
the interest rate on the notes is through maturity in october the new subordinated note agreement includes certain other provisions  including restrictions as to the payment of dividends and the elimination or adjustment of financial covenants contained in the original agreement to conform to those contained in the new senior debt agreements 
in addition  the company s mexican subsidiary had approximately million in bank lines of credit million unused as of september   currently expiring at various dates from january through december  which bear interest at a rate based upon either a floating us bank rate or the rate of certain mexican government securities 
the company is presently reviewing other debt proposals for this subsidiary 
the company relies heavily upon the availability of the lines of credit in the us and mexico for liquidity in its operations 
the company believes that amounts available from its lines of credit under its senior debt and under lines of credit available to its mexican subsidiary are sufficient to fulfill all current and anticipated operating requirements of its business through the company s mexican subsidiary cannot assure that each of its lines of credit will continue to be available after their respective expiration dates  or that replacement lines of credit will be secured 
however  the company believes there should be sufficient amounts available under its present or future facilities or lines of credit to cover any potential shortfalls due to any expiring lines of credit 
refer to notes and to consolidated financial statements for further description of the aforementioned financing arrangements 
the company has been assisted by investment bankers and certain other outside consultants to advise it in evaluating certain strategic alternatives  including capital restructuring  mergers and acquisitions  and or other measures designed to maximize shareholder value

recent accounting pronouncements in april  the fasb issued statement no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities which amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contacts and for hedging activities under fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
statement no 
provides greater clarification of the characteristics of a derivative instrument so that contracts with similar characteristics will be accounted for consistently 
in general  the statement is effective for contracts with similar characteristics will be accounted for consistently 
in general  the statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june   and for hedging relationships designated after june  the company did not enter into or modify any of their derivative financial instruments which consists of only an interest rate swap agreement since june  and thus the adoption of statement no 
did not have any impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  which clarifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity and requires that those instruments be classified as liabilities in statements of financial position 
previously  many of those financial instruments were classified as equity 
statement no 
is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  and otherwise is effective a the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  as the company does not have any of these financial instruments  the adoption of statement no 
is not expected to have any impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the period reported 
the following accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the period that they are determined to be necessary 
if actual results differ significantly from management s estimates  the financial statements could be materially impacted 
the company promotes its products with significant marketing activities  including advertising  consumer incentives and trade promotions 
advertising costs are expensed as incurred 
the company records consumer incentive and trade promotion costs as a reduction of revenues in the year in which these programs are offered  based upon estimates of utilization and redemption rates that are developed from historical information 
accounts receivable is recorded net of allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company regularly reviews the adequacy of its accounts receivable allowance after considering the size of the accounts receivable  the age of each invoice  each customer s expected ability to pay and the collection history with each customer 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents management s best estimate  but changes in circumstances relating to accounts receivable may result in a requirement for additional allowances in the near future 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
the company regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on the company s estimated forecast of product demand 
the company s estimate of forecasted product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case the company may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if the company s inventory is determined to be overvalued  the company would be required to recognize such costs in its cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
likewise if the company s inventory is determined to be undervalued  the company may have over reported costs of goods sold 
therefore  although the company makes every effort to ensure the accuracy of its forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of inventory and the company s reported operating results 
long lived assets  such as property  plant and equipment  are reviewed for impairment when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
when such events occur  the company compares the carrying amount of the assets to undiscounted expected future cash flows 
should this comparison indicate that there is an impairment  the amount of the impairment is calculated using discounted expected future cash flows 
if the estimate of an asset s future cash flows is significantly different from the asset s actual cash flows  the company may over or under estimate the value of an asset s impairment 
a long lived asset s value is also dependent upon its estimated useful life 
a change in the useful life of a long lived asset could result in higher or lower depreciation and amortization expense 
if the asset s actual life is different than its estimated life  the asset could be over valued or under valued 
restructuring and related costs reserves are recorded in connection with the restructuring initiatives as they are announced 
these reserves include estimates pertaining to employee severance costs  the settlement of contractual obligations and other matters 
although management does not anticipate significant changes  the actual costs may differ from these estimates  resulting in further charges or reversals of previously recorded charges 
the carrying value of the company s net deferred tax assets assumes that the company will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record additional valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
management evaluates the recoverability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and assesses the need for additional valuation allowances quarterly 
in fiscal  the company provided additional valuation allowances for certain us deferred tax assets  as more fully described above and in note to consolidated financial statements 
forward looking statements the statements in this annual report on form k that are not purely historical are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of  including statements about the company s expectations  beliefs  intentions or strategies regarding the future 
forward looking statements include statements regarding  among other things  the effects of the devaluation of the mexican peso  the sufficiency and continued availability of the company s lines of credit and its ability to meet its current and anticipated obligations and operating requirements  including payments due under its subordinated debt  management s expectation as to the company s ability to avoid the issuance of warrants to its subordinated lenders  management s expectation for continuing savings from the restructuring and cost reduction program  the company s ability to increase revenues in its core businesses  and its expectations regarding the company s ability to utilize certain tax benefits in the future

such risks include but are not limited to the risk that the shareholders ownership will be diluted by the issuance of common stock to the company s subordinated lenders  the company s lenders will not continue to fund the company in the future  the cancellation of the lines of credit available to the company s mexico subsidiary  the inability to maintain and or secure new sources of capital  manufacturing inefficiencies  difficulties encountered with the consolidation and cost reduction program  increased competition  decreases in revenues  us and foreign economic factors  foreign currency exchange risk  interest rate fluctuation risk  and the inability to generate taxable income to utilize certain tax benefits in the future  among others 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as discussed elsewhere  the company is exposed to the following principal market risks ie risks of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates foreign exchange rates and interest rates on debt 
the company s exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk in its international operations is principally limited to mexico and  to a lesser degree  canada 
approximately of the company s fiscal net revenues were derived in mexico and canada  combined exclusive of intercompany activities 
foreign exchange transaction gains and losses arise from monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the business unit s functional local currency 
it is estimated that a change in both the mexican peso and canadian dollar exchange rates would impact reported operating profit by approximately  this quantitative measure has inherent limitations because it does not take into account the changes in customer purchasing patterns or any adjustment to the company s financing or operating strategies in response to such a change in rates 
moreover  this measure does not take into account the possibility that these currency rates can move in opposite directions  such that gains from one may offset losses from another 
in addition  the company s cash flows and earnings are subject to changes in interest rates 
as of september   approximately of total short and long term debt is fixed  at rates between and 
the balance of the company debt is variable  principally based upon the prevailing us bank prime rate or libor rate 
an interest rate swap  which expires in  fixes the rate of interest on million of this debt at 
a change in the average prevailing interest rates of the remaining debt of would have an estimated impact of  upon the company s pre tax results of operations and cash flows 
this quantitative measure does not take into account the possibility that the prevailing rates us bank prime and libor can move in opposite directions and that the company has  in most cases  the option to elect either as the determining interest rate factor
