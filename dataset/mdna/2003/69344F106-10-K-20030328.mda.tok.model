item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of the financial condition and results of our operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report 
net revenues  change change networking products non networking products total net revenues net revenues for decreased by million  or  from net revenues in  which decreased by million  or  from net revenues in networking in and  our net revenues were impacted by several factors o weakness in the us and global economies o depressed spending levels by telecommunications companies and enterprises that incorporate our products into their networking equipment o excess inventory levels at oem s prior to the onset of these adverse market conditions  our customers had accumulated significant inventories of our products in anticipation of rapid networking equipment sales growth 
in  rather than grow  the market for our customers products contracted  causing a sharp decline in the demand for our products 
consequently  our networking revenues declined million  or in from and declined million  or  in from the lower demand of our products in was not as severe as the decline in from  as our customers consumed a portion of the excess inventories of our products they held 
the majority of the revenue decline resulted from reduced volume shipments of our parts  however price reductions for high volume products also reduced revenues by and in and respectively 
non networking non networking revenues declined million  or  in and million  or  in due to decreased unit sales to our principal customer in this segment 
this product reached the end of its life after the first quarter of  with only insignificant revenues thereafter 
gross profit  change change networking products percentage of networking revenues non networking products percentage of non networking revenues total gross profit percentage of net revenues total gross profit for decreased by million  or  from gross profit in  which decreased by million  or  from gross profit in networking our networking gross profit for decreased by million from the decrease in networking gross profit related primarily to lower sales volume in compared to partially offset by a lower write down of excess inventory of million in compared with a million write down of excess inventory in our networking gross profit for decreased by million from excluding the million write down of excess inventory in  the decrease in networking gross profit in related primarily to the reduced sales volume 
while networking gross profit as a percentage of networking revenues remained constant at for and  the following factors impacted the margin in o a write down of excess inventory in was million lower than a similar write down in  increasing gross profit by percentage points  o reduced shipment volumes resulted in manufacturing costs being spread over fewer units resulting in lowering gross margin by percentage points  despite reducing manufacturing costs by million 
o a shift in mix from the higher margin networking products to those sold into higher volume lower margin applications further reduced gross profit by percentage points 
our networking gross profit as a percentage of networking revenues decreased percentage points from in to in this decrease resulted from the following factors o a million write down of excess inventory which lowered gross profit by percentage points  o a shift in product mix towards lower margin products  which lowered gross profit by percentage points  and o the effect of applying fixed manufacturing costs over reduced shipment volumes which lowered margins by percentage points 
non networking non networking gross profit for both and decreased as a result of declining sales volume 
this product reached the end of its life in other costs and expenses  change change research and development percentage of net revenues marketing  general and administrative percentage of net revenues amortization of deferred stock compensation research and development marketing  general and administrative percentage of net revenues impairment of property and equipment percentage of net revenues restructuring costs and other special charges percentage of net revenues impairment of goodwill and purchased intangible assets percentage of net revenues amortization of goodwill percentage of net revenues costs of merger percentage of net revenues in process research and development percentage of net revenues research and development expenses our research and development  or r d  expenses decreased million  or  in compared to due to the company s restructuring and cost reduction programs implemented in the first and fourth quarters of as a result of these programs  we reduced our r d personnel and related costs by million and other r d expenses by million compared to our r d expenses for were million  or  higher than as the effect of increased hiring and expansion of development programs and costs during was only partially offset by the restructuring and cost reduction programs implemented in we reduced our r d personnel by by the end of from the end of but because we made substantial additions to our personnel and tools during the latter part of and because we realized less than months savings from our fourth quarter restructuring  our r d personnel and related costs for exceeded by million and our tools and equipment costs for exceeded by million 
acquisitions that we completed during and accounted for under the purchase method increased our r d expenses by million compared to marketing  general and administrative expenses our marketing  general and administrative  or mg a  expenses decreased by million  or  in compared to of this decrease  million was attributable to lower variable sales commissions as a result of lower revenues 
the remainder was attributable to the restructuring and cost reduction programs implemented in  which reduced our mg a personnel and related costs by million and other mg a expenses by million compared to our mg a expenses decreased by million  or  in compared to due primarily to a million reduction in sales commissions resulting from the decline in our revenues 
the restructuring programs implemented in reduced our mg a personnel by from the end of  but due to growth in the latter part of resulted in only a year over year decrease in our mg a personnel costs 
this decrease in personnel costs combined with the decrease in recruitment costs resulting from less hiring activity in was more than offset by increases in the cost of facilities due to the prior year s expansion 
acquisitions that we completed during and accounted for under the purchase method increased our mg a expenses by million compared to amortization of deferred stock compensation we recorded a non cash charge of million for amortization of deferred stock compensation in compared to a non cash charge of million in and million in deferred stock compensation charges decreased by million in compared to because we accelerated vesting for certain employees terminated as part of our restructurings 
this acceleration of vesting also resulted in higher charges in compared to impairment of property and equipment in  we recorded an impairment charge of million reflecting a reduction in the estimated fair value of a product tester 
this equipment was removed from service because lower manufacturing and product development volumes resulted in excess product tester capacity 
there were no impairments of property and equipment in or  other than those assets impaired as a result of our restructurings as described below 
restructuring costs and other special charges on january   we announced that we are undertaking a further corporate restructuring to further reduce our operating expenses 
the restructuring plan includes the termination of approximately employees and the closure of design centers in maryland  ireland and india 
we expect that we will record a restructuring charge for workforce reduction  facility lease costs and related asset impairments as these liabilities will be incurred in the first and second quarters of during the year  we paid out million in connection with october restructuring activities 
see critical accounting policies and significant estimates 
cash payments made in for restructuring activities related to the march restructuring plan were million 
we did not have any additional restructurings in during  we did not have any changes in estimates related to restructurings that affected the statement of operations 
restructuring october  due to a continued decline in market conditions  we implemented a second restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of to reduce our operating cost structure 
this restructuring plan included the termination of employees  the consolidation of additional excess facilities  and the curtailment of additional research and development projects 
as a result  we recorded a second restructuring charge of million in the fourth quarter of the following summarizes the activity in the october restructuring liability write down of facility lease software licenses and and workforce contract settlement property and in thousands reduction costs equipment  net total total charge october      noncash charges   cash payments   balance at december     adjustments   cash payments    balance at december    we have completed the restructuring activities contemplated in the october plan  but have not yet disposed of all of our surplus leased facilities 
upon the final disposition of our surplus leased facilities  we expect to achieve annualized savings of approximately million in cost of revenues and operating expenses based on the expenditure levels at the time of this restructuring 
restructuring march  in the first quarter of  we implemented a restructuring plan in response to the decline in demand for our networking products and consequently recorded a restructuring charge of million 
the restructuring plan included the involuntary termination of employees across all business functions  the consolidation of a number of facilities and the curtailment of certain research and development projects 
the following summarizes the activity in the march restructuring liability facility lease write down of and property workforce contract settlement and in thousands reduction costs equipment  net total total charge march      noncash charges   cash payments    balance at december     we completed the restructuring activities contemplated in the march plan by june  and achieved annualized savings of approximately million in cost of revenues and operating expenses based on the expenditure levels at the time of this restructuring 
during the first six months of fiscal  we made cash payments of million in connection with the march restructuring 
the remaining restructuring liability of million at june  related primarily to facility lease payments  net of estimated sublease revenues  and was classified as accrued liabilities on the balance sheet 
we do not expect this restructuring to have any impact on our statement of operations in the future 
amortization of goodwill and impairment of goodwill and purchased intangibles we adopted the statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets on a prospective basis at the beginning of and stopped amortizing goodwill in accordance with the provisions of sfas the impact of not amortizing goodwill on the net income and net income per share for and is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in conjunction with the implementation of sfas  we completed the transitional impairment test as of the beginning of and determined that a transitional impairment charge would not be required 
we also completed our annual impairment test in december and determined that there was no impairment of goodwill 
amortization of goodwill increased to million in from million in primarily as a result of the goodwill recorded in connection with the malleable and datum acquisitions  which were completed in mid during the second quarter of  we discontinued further development of the technology acquired in the purchase of malleable 
we did not expect to have any future cash flows related to the malleable assets and had no alternative use for the technology 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge of million  equal to the remaining net book value of goodwill and intangible assets related to malleable 
as a result  there was no remaining malleable goodwill or intangibles to amortize in the second half of in the fourth quarter of  due to a continued decline in current market conditions and a delay in the introduction of certain products to the market  we completed an assessment of the future revenue potential and estimated costs associated with all acquired technologies 
as a result of this review  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to the acquired goodwill and intangibles recognized in the purchase of datum 
the impairment charge was calculated by the excess of the carrying value of assets over the present value of estimated future cash flow related to these assets 
the impairment charge reduced the amounts subject to amortization for the remainder of costs of merger we did not make any pooling acquisitions  and therefore did not incur any merger costs in or the million of merger costs that were incurred in related to five pooling acquisitions and consisted primarily of investment banking and other professional fees 
in process research and development ipr d we did not make any acquisitions that were accounted for using the purchase method in or  and therefore did not incur any ipr d charges in either of those years 
the million expensed to in process research and development in arose from the acquisitions of malleable and datum 
we calculated the charge for ipr d related to malleable and datum by determining the fair value of the existing products as well as the technology that was currently under development using the income approach 
under the income approach  expected future after tax cash flows from each of the projects under development are estimated and discounted to their net present value at an appropriate risk adjusted rate of return 
revenues were estimated based on relevant market size and growth factors  expected industry trends  individual product sales cycles and the estimated life of each product s underlying technology 
estimated operating expenses  income taxes and charges for the use of contributory assets were deducted from estimated revenues to determine estimated after tax cash flows for each project 
these projected future cash flows were further adjusted for the value contributed by any core technology and development efforts expected to be completed post acquisition 
these forecasted cash flows were then discounted based on rates derived from our weighted average cost of capital  weighted average return on assets and venture capital rates of return adjusted upward to reflect additional risks inherent in the development life cycle 
the risk adjusted discount rates used involved consideration of the characteristics and applications of each product  the inherent uncertainties in achieving technological feasibility  anticipated levels of market acceptance and penetration  market growth rates and risks related to the impact of potential changes in future target markets 
after considering these factors  we determined risk adjusted discount rates of for malleable and for datum 
in our opinion  the pricing model used for products related to these acquisitions were standard within the high technology industry and the estimated ipr d amounts so determined represented fair value and did not exceed the amounts that a third party would have paid for these projects 
when we acquired these companies  we did not expect to achieve a material amount of expense reduction or synergies as a result of integrating the acquired in process technology 
therefore  the valuation assumptions did not include anticipated cost savings 
a description of the ipr d projects acquired is set forth below the in process technology acquired from malleable was planned to detect incoming voice channels and process them using voice compression algorithms 
the compressed voice was to be converted  using the appropriate protocols  to atm cells or ip packets to achieve higher channel density and support multiple speech compression protocols and different packetization requirements 
at the date of acquisition we estimated that malleable s technology was complete and the costs to complete the project to be million 
the technology acquired from datum is a digitally controlled amplifier architecture  which was designed to increase base station system capacities  while reducing cost  size and power consumption of radio networks 
at the date of acquisition  we estimated that datum s technology was complete and the costs to complete the project to be million 
the above estimates were determined by comparing the time and costs spent to date and the complexity of the technologies achieved to date to the total costs  time and complexities that were expected to be expended to bring the technologies to completion 
progress on the technology acquired from malleable was slower than originally estimated and as a result  costs incurred on this project exceeded our original estimates 
in the second quarter of  we discontinued development of this technology and recorded an impairment charge related to the malleable goodwill and purchased intangible assets see amortization of goodwill and impairment of intangibles 
development of the chip incorporating the technology acquired from datum was completed in the fourth quarter of and the costs incurred to that date were in line with our initial expectations 
since then  we have completed the required firmware related to this chip and have extended development of the datum technology to a follow on product 
the general economic slowdown has delayed our customers introduction of the third generation base stations into which we had expected the datum technology to be incorporated 
it is currently uncertain when the datum products will begin to generate significant revenues 
as a result of the delay in introduction of the third generation base stations  we failed to achieve the revenues  net income  and return on investment expected at the time that the acquisition was completed 
we recorded an impairment charge related to the datum goodwill and purchased intangible assets during the fourth quarter of see amortization of goodwill and impairment of intangibles 
interest and other income  net  change change interest and other income  net percentage of net revenues net interest and other income declined in by million  or 
excluding interest expense and the amortization of debt financing costs  interest and other income for was million as compared to million in while our interest income declined by approximately million as a result of a decline of average yields on our cash  short term and long term investments  this decline was partially offset by an additional million in interest income from an overall increase in our average cash balances 
our interest expense and amortization of our debt issuance costs increased to million in  from million in  because our convertible subordinated notes were outstanding for the entire year of compared to less than five months in our net interest income decreased to million in from million in while our interest income declined by approximately million as a result of a decline of average yields on our cash  short term and long term investments  this decline was offset by an additional million in interest income from an overall increase in our cash balances 
interest expense increased by million and we incurred million in amortized debt issuance costs in compared to due to the issuance of our convertible subordinated notes in august other income in included income from an equity interest in another company of million 
gain loss on investments  change change gain loss on investments percentage of net revenues we reported a net loss on investments of million in  million in and a gain on investments of million in in  we recorded a million gain on the sale of a portion of our investment in sierra wireless  inc  a public company  as well as other investments 
this gain was offset by a million charge to recognize the impairment of our investments in non public entities 
see critical accounting policies and significant estimates 
in  we recorded a million gain on the sale of a portion of our investment in sierra wireless  as well as other investments 
this gain was offset by a million charge to recognize the impairment of our investments in non public entities 
see critical accounting policies and significant estimates 
in  gains of million and million resulted from the sale of a portion of our investment in sierra wireless and our investment in cypress semiconductor  inc  respectively 
our investment in cypress semiconductor was received through its acquisition of ic works  a company in which we had invested 
provision for income taxes 
our annual effective tax rate for the year ended december  was a recovery of 
excluding the effects of non deductible amortization of purchased intangibles and deferred stock compensation  and incremental taxes on foreign earnings  the effective income tax rate for was a recovery of compared to the statutory tax rate of 
our effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate as a result of a valuation allowance provided on deferred tax assets  where timing of realization is uncertain 
our annual effective tax rate for the year ended december  was a recovery of 
excluding the effects of non deductible goodwill  deferred stock compensation amortization  impairment of purchased intangibles  and incremental taxes on foreign earnings  the effective income tax rate for was a recovery of compared to the statutory tax rate of 
our effective tax rate was lower than the statutory rate for the same reason as in our annual effective tax rate for the year ended december  was an expense of compared to a statutory tax rate of 
our increased effective tax rate primarily reflects the higher provision for income taxes for our canadian subsidiary and the non tax deductible charges for in process research and development  goodwill amortization  deferred stock compensation and acquisition costs related to acquisitions completed during the year 
these factors were partially offset by the utilization of tax losses and other deferred tax assets for which benefits were previously not recognized 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding income taxes 
recently issued accounting standards 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas requires that the liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized at its fair value when the liability is incurred 
under previous guidance  a liability for certain exit costs was recognized at the date that management committed to an exit plan 
as sfas is effective only for exit or disposal activities initiated after december   the adoption of this statement will not impact our financial statements for  but will affect the accounting for any restructurings initiated after in january  we announced a third restructuring plan  the costs of which will be accounted for in accordance with sfas in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires that upon issuance of a guarantee  a guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of an obligation assumed under a guarantee 
fin also requires additional disclosures by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about the obligations associated with guarantees issued 
the recognition provisions of fin will be effective for any guarantees that are issued or modified after december  we adopted the disclosure requirements and are currently evaluating the effects of the recognition provisions of fin  however  we do not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas also requires prominent disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies of both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
we adopted sfas for our fiscal year end 
adoption of this statement has affected the location of this disclosure within our consolidated financial statements  but will not impact our results of operation or financial position unless we change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
critical accounting estimates general management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported by us of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are reasonable in the circumstances 
senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of pmc s board of directors 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are outlined in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in management s opinion the following critical accounting policies require the most significant judgment and involve complex estimation 
we also have other policies that we consider to be key accounting policies  such as our policies of revenue recognition  including the deferral of revenues on sales to major distributors  however these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates as they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
restructuring charges facilities in calculating the cost to dispose of our excess facilities we had to estimate for each location the amount to be paid in lease termination payments  the future lease and operating costs to be paid until the lease is terminated  and the amount  if any  of sublease revenues 
this required us to estimate the timing and costs of each lease to be terminated  the amount of operating costs for the affected facilities  and the timing and rate at which we might be able to sublease each site 
to form our estimates for these costs we performed an assessment of the affected facilities and considered the current market conditions for each site 
during  we recorded total charges of million for the restructuring of excess facilities as part of restructuring plans  which was approximately of the estimated total future operating cost and lease obligation for those sites 
as at the end of  the remaining restructuring accrual is of the estimated total future operating costs and lease obligations for the remaining sites 
to the best of our knowledge  this estimate remains sufficient to cover anticipated settlement costs 
however  our assumptions on either the lease termination payments  operating costs until terminated  or the amounts and timing of offsetting sublease revenues may turn out to be incorrect and our actual cost may be materially different from our estimates 
inventory we periodically compare our inventory levels to sales forecasts for the future twelve months on a part by part basis and record a charge for inventory on hand in excess of the estimated twelve month demand 
in  our inventory of networking products exceeded estimated month demand by million and we recorded a charge of that amount 
if future demand for our products continues to decline  we may have to take an additional write down of inventory 
income taxes we have incurred losses and other costs that can be applied against future taxable earnings to reduce our tax liability on those earnings 
as we are uncertain of realizing the future benefit of those losses and expenditures  we have taken a valuation allowance against all domestic deferred tax assets and recorded only deferred tax assets that can be applied in currently taxable foreign jurisdictions 
investment in non public entities we have invested in non public companies and in venture capital funds  which we review periodically to determine if there has been a non temporary decline in the market value of those investments below our carrying value 
our assessment of impairment in carrying value is based on the market value trends of similar public companies  the current business performance of the entities in which we have invested  and if available  the estimated future market potential of the companies and venture funds 
we recorded an impairment of our investments in non public entities of million in the fourth quarter of when we perform future assessments of these investments  a further decline in the value of these companies and venture funds may require us to recognize additional impairment on the remaining million investment 
valuation of long lived assets including goodwill and purchased intangible assets we review property and equipment  goodwill and purchased intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
such events may include a change in business strategy  significant declines in our sales forecast or prolonged negative industry or economic trends 
our asset impairment review assesses the fair value of the assets based on the future cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
for long lived assets  an impairment loss is recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset if any are less than the carrying value of the asset 
for goodwill  an impairment loss will be recorded to the extent than the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
in  we recorded an impairment charge of million reflecting the reduction in fair value of a product tester 
we did not identify any impairment to goodwill or purchased intangibles during our annual assessment in business outlook our annual networking revenues are impacted by short and longer term trends in the demand for the networking equipment that incorporate our products 
future demand for our customers products is in turn affected by the plans of their customers 
our customers demand for our products is also impacted by levels of inventories of our parts held by them or their supply chain partners 
in and  many of our customers experienced significant declines in demand for their products  and accumulated significant inventories of our products that exceed the amounts required to meet current production levels 
consequently  the demand for our products declined in from approximately million in the first quarter to approximately million in the fourth quarter 
quarterly revenues during ranged from million to million 
because the level of demand for the networking equipment that our customers sell depends upon global economic conditions  it is difficult to predict when end market demand for our products will improve 
however  we believe that our customers may consume much of their inventories of some of our older products in and begin to purchase more of our products as their inventories become depleted 
we expect our networking revenues for the first quarter of to increase slightly from the fourth quarter of beyond the first quarter of  we anticipate revenues will vary depending on changes in the demand environment and customer component inventory levels 
we do not anticipate any meaningful revenue from our non networking products in the future as the single product in this revenue category has reached end of life 
we anticipate our gross margins will be in the high to low range in but could vary significantly depending on the volumes and mix of products sold 
excluding the impact of any restructuring activities that are reflected in r d and mg a expenses  we expect these costs to decline in as compared to due to our cost cutting initiatives  including the restructuring we announced in january we anticipate that interest and other income will decline significantly in compared to because we expect to earn lower average yields on our cash balances and expect to consume cash throughout to primarily meet restructuring obligations accrued as current liabilities 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity at december  were our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
we also held million of investments in bonds and notes with maturities ranging from to years 
the aggregate cash and investments of million at december  was million lower than it was on december  and included million of restricted cash see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in  we used million of cash for operating activities  million for purchases of property and equipment and million  net of proceeds on sales  for other investments 
we generated million of cash through financing activities  primarily through the issuance of common stock 
we invested our portfolio of short and long term bonds and notes in corporate and us and canadian government securities having an s p  moody s or equivalent rating of a or better 
all of our bond and note investments mature in less than years 
we invest these capital resources primarily for preservation of capital and secondarily for yield 
we have a line of credit with a bank that allows us to borrow up to million at the bank s alternate base rate as long as the company maintains eligible investments with the bank in an amount equal to its drawings 
at december  we had committed all of this facility under letters of credit as security for office leases 
these letters of credit renew automatically each year and expire in we have commitments made up of the following as at december  in thousands payments due after contractual obligations total operating lease obligations minimum rental payments        estimated operating cost payments        long term debt principal repayment   interest payments      purchase obligations    venture investment commitments see below  total contractual cash obligations  approximately million of the minimum rental payments and estimated operating costs identified in the table above relate to operating leases for vacant and excess office facilities 
we are currently negotiating settlements of these leases and may incur significant related cash expenditures 
we expect to expend the majority of the million we have accrued for restructuring costs in settlement of these obligations in see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding restructuring and other costs 
we participate in four professionally managed venture funds that invest in early stage private technology companies in markets of strategic interest to us 
from time to time these funds request additional capital for private placements 
we have committed to invest an additional million into these funds  which may be requested by the fund managers at any time over the next seven years 
we have not entered into any derivative contracts other than our convertible notes and through our stock option plans  and we have not entered into any synthetic leases 
we believe that existing sources of liquidity will satisfy our projected restructuring  operating  working capital  venture investing  debt interest  capital expenditure and wafer deposit requirements through the end of we expect to spend approximately million on new capital additions during factors that you should consider before investing in pmc sierra our company is subject to a number of risks some are normal to the fabless networking semiconductor industry  some are the same or similar to those disclosed in previous sec filings  and some may be present in the future 
you should carefully consider all of these risks and the other information in this report before investing in pmc 
the fact that certain risks are endemic to the industry does not lessen the significance of the risk 
as a result of these risks  our business  financial condition or operating results could be materially adversely affected 
this could cause the trading price of our securities to decline  and you may lose part or all of your investment 
we are subject to rapid changes in demand for our products due to customer inventory levels  production schedules  fluctuations in demand for networking equipment and our customer concentration 
as a result of these factors  we have very limited revenue visibility and the rate by which revenues are booked and shipped within the same reporting period is typically volatile 
in addition  our net bookings can vary sharply up and down within a quarter 
our revenues have declined due to reduced demand in the markets we serve  and may decline further in several of our customers clients have reported lower than expected demand for their services or products  which has resulted in poor operating results and difficulty in accessing the capital needed to build their networks or survive to profitability 
many of these companies are facing increased competition and have either filed for bankruptcy or may become insolvent in the near future 
concurrently  many of our customers more viable network service provider clients have accumulated significant debt loads to finance capital projects that have yet to generate significant positive cash flows 
in addition  most of our customers clients have announced a shift in forecasted expenditures on the equipment our customers sell  which may generate financial return in a shorter time horizon 
this equipment to which they shift may not incorporate  or may incorporate fewer  of our products 
in response to the actual and anticipated declines in networking equipment demand  many of our customers and their contract manufacturers have undertaken initiatives to significantly reduce expenditures and excess component inventories 
many platforms in which our products are designed have been cancelled as our customers cancel or restructure product development initiatives or as venture financed startup companies fail 
our revenues may be materially and adversely impacted in if these conditions continue or worsen 
our customers actions have materially and adversely impacted our revenues  reduced our visibility of future revenue streams  caused an increase in our inventory levels  and made a portion of our inventory obsolete 
as most of our costs are fixed in the short term  a further reduction in demand for our products may cause a further decline in our gross and net margins 
while we believe that our customers and their contract manufacturers are consuming a portion of their inventory of pmc products  we believe that those inventories  as well as the weakened demand that our customers are experiencing for their products  may further depress our revenues and profit margins beyond see business outlook above 
we cannot accurately predict when demand for our products will strengthen or how quickly our customers will consume their inventories of our products 
our customers may cancel or delay the purchase of our products for reasons other than the industry downturn described above 
many of our customers have numerous product lines  numerous component requirements for each product  sizeable and complex supplier structures  and often engage contract manufacturers to supplement their manufacturing capacity 
this makes forecasting their production requirements difficult and can lead to an inventory surplus of certain of their components 
our customers often shift buying patterns as they manage inventory levels  decide to use competing products  are acquired or divested  market different products  or change production schedules 
in addition  we believe that uncertainty in our customers end markets and our customers increased focus on cash management has caused our customers to delay product orders and reduce delivery lead time expectations 
we expect this will increase the proportion of our revenues in future periods that will be from orders placed and fulfilled within the same period 
this will decrease our ability to accurately forecast and may lead to greater fluctuations in operating results 
we rely on a few customers for a major portion of our sales  any one of which could materially impact our revenues should they change their ordering pattern 
we depend on a limited number of customers for a major portion of our revenues 
through direct  distributor and subcontractor purchases  cisco systems and hewlett packard each accounted for more than of our fiscal revenues 
both of these customers have announced order shortfalls for some of their products 
we do not have long term volume purchase commitments from any of our major customers 
accordingly  our future operating results will continue to depend on the success of our largest customers and on our ability to sell existing and new products to these customers in significant quantities 
the loss of a key customer  or a reduction in our sales to any key customer or our inability to attract new significant customers could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if the current downturn continues  we may have to add to our inventory reserve  which would lead to a further decline in our operating profits 
as a result of the industry wide reduction in capital spending and resulting significant decrease in demand for our products  we determined that we had inventory levels that exceeded our anticipated demand over the next twelve months 
accordingly  in we recorded an inventory write down of million related to excess inventory on hand 
the inventory reserve was based on our revenue expectations through if future demand of our products does not meet our expectations  we may need to take an additional write down of inventory 
we anticipate lower margins on high volume products  which could adversely affect our profitability 
we expect the average selling prices of our products to decline as they mature 
historically  competition in the semiconductor industry has driven down the average selling prices of products 
if we price our products too high  our customers may use a competitor s product or an in house solution 
to maintain profit margins  we must reduce our costs sufficiently to offset declines in average selling prices  or successfully sell proportionately more new products with higher average selling prices 
yield or other production problems  or shortages of supply may preclude us from lowering or maintaining current operating costs 
oems are becoming more price conscious than in the past as a result of the industry downturn  and as semiconductors sourced from third party suppliers comprise a greater portion of the total materials cost in oem equipment 
we have also experienced more aggressive price competition from competitors that wish to enter into the market segments in which we participate 
these circumstances may make some of our products less competitive and we may be forced to decrease our prices significantly to win a design 
we may lose design opportunities or may experience overall declines in gross margins as a result of increased price competition 
in addition  our networking products range widely in terms of the margins they generate 
a change in product sales mix could impact our operating results materially 
design wins do not translate into near term revenues and the timing of revenues from newly designed products is often uncertain 
we have announced a number of new products and design wins for existing and new products 
while some industry analysts may use design wins as a metric for future revenues  many design wins have not  nor will not generate any revenues as customer projects are cancelled or rejected by their end market 
in the event a design win generates revenue  the amount of revenue will vary greatly from one design win to another 
in addition  most revenue generating design wins do not translate into near term revenues 
most revenue generating design wins take greater than years to generate meaningful revenue 
our revenue expectations may include growing sales of newer semiconductors based on early adoption of those products by customers 
these expectations would not be achieved if early sales of new system level products by our customers do not increase over time 
we may experience this more with design wins from early stage companies  who tend to focus on leading edge technologies that may be adopted less rapidly in the current environment by telecommunications service providers 
our restructurings have curtailed our resources and may have insufficiently addressed market conditions 
we announced in plans to restructure our operations in response to the decline in demand for our networking products 
the restructuring plans included a workforce reduction of employees  consolidation of excess facilities  and contract settlement activities 
as a result of our restructuring plans  we recorded a charge of million in on january th   we announced plans to further restructure our operations through a workforce reduction of employees and the shutdown of four of our research and development sites 
we will record a charge in the first two quarters of of our estimate of the costs for the restructuring 
we reduced the work force and consolidated or shut down excess facilities in an effort to bring our expenses into line with our reduced revenue expectations 
however  for much of  we do not expect that these measures will be sufficient to offset lower revenues  and as such  we expect to continue to incur net losses 
while management uses all available information to estimate these restructuring costs  particularly facilities costs  our accruals may prove to be inadequate 
if our actual sublease revenues or exiting negotiations differ from our original assumptions  we may have to record additional charges  which could materially affect our results of operations  financial position and cash flow 
restructuring plans require significant management resources to execute and we may fail to achieve our targeted goals and our expected annualized savings 
we may have incorrectly anticipated the demand for our products  we may be forced to restructure further or may incur further operating charges due to poor business conditions and some of our product development initiatives may be delayed due to the reduction in our development resources 
our revenues may decline if our customers use our competitors products instead of ours  suffer further reductions in demand for their products or are acquired or sold 
we are experiencing significantly greater competition from many different market participants as the market in which we participate matures 
in addition  we are expanding into markets  such as the wireless infrastructure and generic microprocessor markets  which have established incumbents with substantial financial and technological resources 
we expect fiercer competition than that which we have traditionally faced as some of these incumbents derive a majority of their earnings from these markets 
all of our competitors pose the following threats to us as our customers design next generation systems and select the chips for those new systems  our competitors have an opportunity to convince our customers to use their products  which may cause our revenues to decline 
we typically face competition at the design stage  where customers evaluate alternative design approaches requiring integrated circuits 
our competitors may have more opportunities to supplant our products in next generation systems because of the shortening product life and design in cycles in many of our customers products 
in addition  as a result of the industry downturn  and as semiconductors sourced from third party suppliers comprise a greater portion of the total materials cost in oem equipment  oems are becoming more price conscious than in the past 
we have also experienced increased price aggressiveness from some competitors that wish to enter into the market segments in which we participate 
these circumstances may make some of our products price uncompetitive or force us to match low prices 
we may lose design opportunities or may experience overall declines in gross margins as a result of increased price competition 
the markets for our products are intensely competitive and subject to rapid technological advancement in design tools  wafer manufacturing techniques  process tools and alternate networking technologies 
we may not be able to develop new products at competitive pricing and performance levels 
even if we are able to do so  we may not complete a new product and introduce it to market in a timely manner 
our customers may substitute use of our products in their next generation equipment with those of current or future competitors 
increasing competition in our industry will make it more difficult to achieve design wins 
we face significant competition from three major fronts 
first  we compete against established peer group semiconductor companies that focus on the communications semiconductor business 
these companies include agere systems  applied micro circuits corporation  broadcom  exar corporation  conexant systems  marvell technology group  multilink technology corporation  silicon image  transwitch and vitesse semiconductor 
these companies are well financed  have significant communications semiconductor technology assets  have established sales channels  and are dependent on the market in which we participate for the bulk of their revenues 
other competitors include major domestic and international semiconductor companies  such as agilent  cypress semiconductor  intel  ibm  infineon  integrated device technology  maxim integrated products  motorola  nortel networks  and texas instruments 
these companies are concentrating an increasing amount of their substantial financial and other resources on the markets in which we participate 
this represents a serious competitive threat to us 
emerging venture backed companies also provide significant competition in our segment of the semiconductor market 
these companies tend to focus on specific portions of our broad range of products and in the aggregate  represent a significant threat to our product lines 
in addition  these companies could introduce disruptive technologies that may make our technologies and products obsolete 
over the next few years  we expect additional competitors  some of which may also have greater financial and other resources  to enter the market with new products 
these companies  individually or collectively  could represent future competition for many design wins  and subsequent product sales 
we must often redesign our products to meet evolving industry standards and customer specifications  which may prevent or delay future revenue growth 
we sell products to a market whose characteristics include evolving industry standards  product obsolescence  and new manufacturing and design technologies 
many of the standards and protocols for our products are based on high speed networking technologies that have not been widely adopted or ratified by one or more of the standard setting bodies in our customers industry 
our customers often delay or alter their design demands during this standard setting process 
in response  we must redesign our products to suit these changing demands 
redesign usually delays the production of our products 
our products may become obsolete during these delays 
since many of the products we develop do not reach full production sales volumes for a number of years  we may incorrectly anticipate market demand and develop products that achieve little or no market acceptance 
our products generally take between and months from initial conceptualization to development of a viable prototype  and another to months to be designed into our customers equipment and into production 
our products often must be redesigned because manufacturing yields on prototypes are unacceptable or customers redefine their products to meet changing industry standards or customer specifications 
as a result  we develop products many years before volume production and may inaccurately anticipate our customers needs 
our strategy includes broadening our business into the enterprise  storage and consumer markets 
we may not be successful in achieving significant sales in these new markets 
the enterprise  storage and consumer markets are already addressed by incumbent suppliers which have established relationships with customers 
we may be unsuccessful in displacing these suppliers  or having our products designed into products for different market needs 
we may incur increased research  development and sales costs to address these new markets 
we are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and we may have difficulty collecting receivables from customers based in foreign countries 
many of our customers employ contract manufacturers to produce their products and manage their inventories 
many of these contract manufacturers represent greater credit risk than our networking equipment customers  who generally do not guarantee our credit receivables related to their contract manufacturers 
in addition  international debt rating agencies have significantly downgraded the bond ratings on a number of our larger customers  which had traditionally been considered financially stable 
should these companies enter into bankruptcy proceedings or breach their debt covenants  our significant accounts receivables with these companies could be jeopardized 
the complexity of our products could result in unforeseen delays or expenses and in undetected defects or bugs  which could adversely affect the market acceptance of new products and damage our reputation with current or prospective customers 
although we  or our customers and our suppliers rigorously test our products  our highly complex products regularly contain defects or bugs 
we have in the past experienced  and may in the future experience  these defects and bugs 
if any of our products contain defects or bugs  or have reliability  quality or compatibility problems that are significant to our customers  our reputation may be damaged and customers may be reluctant to buy our products 
this could materially and adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers or attract new customers 
in addition  these defects or bugs could interrupt or delay sales to our customers 
we may have to invest significant capital and other resources to alleviate problems with our products 
if any of these problems are not found until after we have commenced commercial production of a new product  we may be required to incur additional development costs and product recall  repair or replacement costs 
these problems may also result in claims against us by our customers or others 
in addition  these problems may divert our technical and other resources from other development efforts 
moreover  we would likely lose  or experience a delay in  market acceptance of the affected product or products  and we could lose credibility with our current and prospective customers 
we may be unsuccessful in transitioning the design of our new products to new manufacturing processes 
many of our new products are designed to take advantage of new manufacturing processes offering smaller manufacturing geometries as they become available  as the smaller geometry products can provide a product with improved features such as lower power requirements  more functionality and lower cost 
we believe that the transition of our products to smaller geometries is critical for us to remain competitive 
we could experience difficulties in migrating to future geometries or manufacturing processes  which would result in the delay of the production of our products 
our products may become obsolete during these delays  or allow competitors parts to be chosen by customers during the design process 
our business strategy contemplates acquisition of other companies or technologies  which could adversely affect our operating performance 
acquiring products  technologies or businesses from third parties is part of our business strategy 
management may be diverted from our operations while they identify and negotiate these acquisitions and integrate an acquired entity into our operations 
also  we may be forced to develop expertise outside our existing businesses  and replace key personnel who leave due to an acquisition 
an acquisition could absorb substantial cash resources  require us to incur or assume debt obligations  or issue additional equity 
if we issue more equity  we may dilute our common stock with securities that have an equal or a senior interest 
acquired entities also may have unknown liabilities  and the combined entity may not achieve the results that were anticipated at the time of the acquisition 
the timing of revenues from newly designed products is often uncertain 
in the past  we have had to redesign products that we acquired when buying other businesses  resulting in increased expenses and delayed revenues 
this may occur in the future as we commercialize the new products resulting from acquisitions 
we participate in funds that invest in early stage private technology companies to gain access to emerging technologies 
these companies possess unproven technologies and our investments may or may not yield positive returns 
we currently have commitments to invest million in such funds 
in addition to consuming significant amounts of cash  these investments are risky because the technologies that these companies are developing may not reach commercialization 
we may record an impairment charge to our operating results should we determine that these funds have incurred a non temporary decline in value 
the loss of personnel could preclude us from designing new products 
to succeed  we must retain and hire technical personnel highly skilled at the design and test functions needed to develop high speed networking products and related software 
the competition for such employees is intense 
we do not have employment agreements in place with many of our key personnel 
as employee incentives  we issue common stock options that generally have exercise prices at the market value at the time of grant and that are subject to vesting 
recently  our stock price has declined substantially 
the stock options we grant to employees are effective as retention incentives only if they have economic value 
our recent restructurings have significantly reduced the number of our technical employees 
we may experience customer dissatisfaction as a result of delayed or cancelled product development initiatives 
we may not be able to meet customer demand for our products if we do not accurately predict demand or if we fail to secure adequate wafer fabrication or assembly capacity 
we currently do not have the ability to accurately predict what products our customers will need in the future 
anticipating demand is difficult because our customers face volatile pricing and demand for their end user networking equipment  our customers are focusing more on cash preservation and tighter inventory management  and because we supply a large number of products to a variety of customers and contract manufacturers who have many equipment programs for which they purchase our products 
our customers are frequently requesting shipment of our products earlier than our normal lead times 
if we do not accurately predict what mix of products our customers may order  we may not be able to meet our customers demand in a timely manner or we may be left with unwanted inventory 
a shortage in supply could adversely impact our ability to satisfy customer demand  which could adversely affect our customer relationships along with our current and future operating results 
we rely on limited sources of wafer fabrication  the loss of which could delay and limit our product shipments 
we do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility 
three outside foundries supply greater than of our semiconductor device requirements 
our foundry suppliers also produce products for themselves and other companies 
in addition  we may not have access to adequate capacity or certain process technologies 
we have less control over delivery schedules  manufacturing yields and costs than competitors with their own fabrication facilities 
if the foundries we use are unable or unwilling to manufacture our products in required volumes  we may have to identify and qualify acceptable additional or alternative foundries 
this qualification process could take six months or longer 
we may not find sufficient capacity quickly enough  if ever  to satisfy our production requirements 
some companies that supply our customers are similarly dependent on a limited number of suppliers to produce their products 
these other companies products may be designed into the same networking equipment into which our products are designed 
our order levels could be reduced materially if these companies are unable to access sufficient production capacity to produce in volumes demanded by our customers because our customers may be forced to slow down or halt production on the equipment into which our products are designed 
we depend on third parties in asia for assembly of our semiconductor products that could delay and limit our product shipments 
sub assemblers in asia assemble all of our semiconductor products 
raw material shortages  political and social instability  assembly house service disruptions  currency fluctuations  or other circumstances in the region could force us to seek additional or alternative sources of supply or assembly 
this could lead to supply constraints or product delivery delays that  in turn  may result in the loss of revenues 
we have less control over delivery schedules  assembly processes  quality assurances and costs than competitors that do not outsource these tasks 
we depend on a limited number of design software suppliers  the loss of which could impede our product development 
a limited number of suppliers provide the computer aided design  or cad  software we use to design our products 
factors affecting the price  availability or technical capability of these products could affect our ability to access appropriate cad tools for the development of highly complex products 
in particular  the cad software industry has been the subject of extensive intellectual property rights litigation  the results of which could materially change the pricing and nature of the software we use 
we also have limited control over whether our software suppliers will be able to overcome technical barriers in time to fulfill our needs 
we are subject to the risks of conducting business outside the united states to a greater extent than companies that operate their businesses mostly in the united states  which may impair our sales  development or manufacturing of our products 
we are subject to the risks of conducting business outside the united states to a greater extent than most companies because  in addition to selling our products in a number of countries  a significant portion of our research and development and manufacturing is conducted outside the united states 
the geographic diversity of our business operations could hinder our ability to coordinate design and sales activities 
if we are unable to develop systems and communication processes to support our geographic diversity  we may suffer product development delays or strained customer relationships 
we may lose our ability to design or produce products  could face additional unforeseen costs or could lose access to key customers if any of the nations in which we conduct business impose trade barriers or new communications standards 
we may have difficulty obtaining export licenses for certain technology produced for us outside the united states 
if a foreign country imposes new taxes  tariffs  quotas  and other trade barriers and restrictions or the united states and a foreign country develop hostilities or change diplomatic and trade relationships  we may not be able to continue manufacturing or sub assembly of our products in that country and may have fewer sales in that country 
we may also have fewer sales in a country that imposes new communications standards or technologies 
this could inhibit our ability to meet our customers demand for our products and lower our revenues 
if foreign exchange rates fluctuate significantly  our profitability may decline 
we are exposed to foreign currency rate fluctuations because a significant part of our development  test  marketing and administrative costs are denominated in canadian dollars  and our selling costs are denominated in a variety of currencies around the world 
while we have adopted a foreign currency risk management policy  which is intended to reduce the effects of short term fluctuations  our policy may not be effective and it does not address long term fluctuations 
in addition  while all of our sales are denominated in us dollars  our customers products are sold worldwide 
any further decline in the world networking markets could seriously depress our customers order levels for our products 
this effect could be exacerbated if fluctuations in currency exchange rates decrease the demand for our customers products 
from time to time  we become defendants in legal proceedings about which we are unable to assess our exposure and which could become significant liabilities upon judgment 
we become defendants in legal proceedings from time to time 
companies in our industry have been subject to claims related to patent infringement and product liability  as well as contract and personal claims 
we may not be able to accurately assess the risk related to these suits  and we may be unable to accurately assess our level of exposure 
these proceedings may result in material charges to our operating results in the future if our exposure is material and if our ability to assess our exposure becomes clearer 
if we cannot protect our proprietary technology  we may not be able to prevent competitors from copying our technology and selling similar products  which would harm our revenues 
to compete effectively  we must protect our proprietary information 
we rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  copyrights  trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property rights 
we hold several patents and have a number of pending patent applications 
we might not succeed in attaining patents from any of our pending applications 
even if we are awarded patents  they may not provide any meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us  as they may not be of sufficient scope or strength  or may not be issued in all countries where our products can be sold 
in addition  our competitors may be able to design around our patents 
we develop  manufacture and sell our products in asian and other countries that may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
this makes piracy of our technology and products more likely 
steps we take to protect our proprietary information may not be adequate to prevent theft of our technology 
we may not be able to prevent our competitors from independently developing technologies that are similar to or better than ours 
our products employ technology that may infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties  which may expose us to litigation and prevent us from selling our products 
vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights or positions characterize the semiconductor industry 
this often results in expensive and lengthy litigation 
we  and our customers or suppliers  may be accused of infringing on patents or other intellectual property rights owned by third parties 
this has happened in the past 
an adverse result in any litigation could force us to pay substantial damages  stop manufacturing  using and selling the infringing products  spend significant resources to develop non infringing technology  discontinue using certain processes or obtain licenses to the infringing technology 
in addition  we may not be able to develop non infringing technology  nor might we be able to find appropriate licenses on reasonable terms 
patent disputes in the semiconductor industry are often settled through cross licensing arrangements 
because we currently do not have a substantial portfolio of patents compared to our larger competitors  we may not be able to settle an alleged patent infringement claim through a cross licensing arrangement 
we are therefore more exposed to third party claims than some of our larger competitors and customers 
in the past  our customers have been required to obtain licenses from and pay royalties to third parties for the sale of systems incorporating our semiconductor devices 
customers may also make claims against us with respect to infringement 
furthermore  we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringing our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights 
this could consume significant resources and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel  regardless of the litigation s outcome 
we have significantly increased our debt level as a result of the sale of convertible subordinated notes 
on august   we raised million through the issuance of convertible subordinated notes 
as a result  our interest payment obligations have increased substantially 
the degree to which we are leveraged could materially and adversely affect our ability to obtain financing for working capital  acquisitions or other purposes and could make us more vulnerable to industry downturns and competitive pressures 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations will be dependent upon our future performance  which will be subject to financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
on august   we are obliged to repay the full remaining principal amount of the notes that have not been converted into our common stock 
securities we issue to fund our operations could dilute your ownership 
we may decide to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing to fund our operations 
if we raise funds by issuing equity securities  the percentage ownership of current stockholders will be reduced and the new equity securities may have priority rights to your investment 
we may not obtain sufficient financing on terms that are favorable to you or us 
we may delay  limit or eliminate some or all of our proposed operations if adequate funds are not available 
our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile 
in the past  our common stock price has fluctuated significantly 
in particular  our stock price declined significantly in the context of announcements made by us and other semiconductor suppliers of reduced revenue expectations and of a general slowdown in the markets we serve 
given these general economic conditions and the reduced demand for our products that we have experienced  we expect that our stock price will continue to be volatile 
in addition  fluctuations in our stock price and our price to earnings multiple may have made our stock attractive to momentum  hedge or day trading investors who often shift funds into and out of stocks rapidly  exacerbating price fluctuations in either direction particularly when viewed on a quarterly basis 
securities class action litigation has often been instituted against a company following periods of volatility and decline in the market price of their securities 
if instituted against us  regardless of the outcome  such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of our management s attention and resources and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
we could be required to pay substantial damages  including punitive damages  if we were to lose such a lawsuit 
provisions in our charter documents and delaware law and our adoption of a stockholder rights plan may delay or prevent acquisition of us  which could decrease the value of our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could make it harder for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
delaware law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of or more of our outstanding common stock 
in addition  our board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval  which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer 
although we believe these provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and delaware law and our stockholder rights plan will provide for an opportunity to receive a higher bid by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors  these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders 
our board of directors adopted a stockholder rights plan  pursuant to which we declared and paid a dividend of one right for each share of common stock held by stockholders of record as of may  unless redeemed by us prior to the time the rights are exercised  upon the occurrence of certain events  the rights will entitle the holders to receive upon exercise thereof shares of our preferred stock  or shares of an acquiring entity  having a value equal to twice the then current exercise price of the right 
the issuance of the rights could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion regarding our risk management activities contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
cash equivalents  short term investments and investments in bonds and notes we regularly maintain a short and long term investment portfolio of various types of government and corporate debt instruments 
our investments are made in accordance with an investment policy approved by our board of directors 
maturities of these instruments are less than two and one half years  with the majority being within one year 
to minimize credit risk  we diversify our investments and select minimum ratings of p or a by moody s  or a or a by standard and poor s  or equivalent 
we classify these securities as held to maturity or available for sale depending on our investment intention 
held to maturity investments are held at amortized cost  while available for sale investments are held at fair market value 
available for sale securities represented approximately of our investment portfolio as of december  investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted because of a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations because of changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if we were to sell securities that have declined in market value because of changes in interest rates 
we do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our exposure to interest rate risk through the use of derivative financial instruments 
based on a sensitivity analysis performed on the financial instruments held at december  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  the impact to the fair value of our investment portfolio by an immediate hypothetical parallel shift in the yield curve of plus or minus  or basis points would result in a decline or increase in portfolio value of approximately million  million and million respectively 
other investments other investments at december  include a minority investment of approximately million shares of sierra wireless inc  a publicly traded company 
the securities are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income  net of income taxes 
we also periodically receive distributions of public company stock as a result of venture investments 
these shares are usually subject to resale restrictions and typically include a number of shares held in escrow that may or may not be released at a later date 
at december   we held approximately  shares of intel corporation  which we received when intel acquired a private company in which we had an investment 
it is our intention to sell these securities in the first quarter of our public company investments are subject to considerable market price volatility and are additionally risky due to resale restrictions 
we may lose some or all of our investment in these shares 
our other investments also include numerous strategic investments in privately held companies or venture funds that are carried on our balance sheet at cost 
we expect to make additional investments like these in the future 
these investments are inherently risky  as they typically are comprised of investments in companies and partnerships that are still in the start up or development stages 
the market for the technologies or products that they have under development is typically in the early stages  and may never materialize 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment of our other investments of million in response to declining market valuations for these investments 
we could lose our entire investment in these companies and partnerships or may incur an additional expense if we determine that the value of these assets have been further impaired 
foreign currency we generate a significant portion of our revenues from sales to customers located outside of the united states including canada  europe  the middle east and asia 
we are subject to risks typical of an international business including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely affected by changes in these or other factors 
our sales and corresponding receivables are made primarily in united states dollars 
through our operations in canada and elsewhere outside of the united states  we incur research and development  customer support costs and administrative expenses in canadian and other local currencies 
we are exposed  in the normal course of business  to foreign currency risks on these expenditures 
in our effort to manage such risks  we have adopted a foreign currency risk management policy intended to reduce the effects of potential short term fluctuations on the results of operations stemming from our exposure to these risks 
as part of this risk management  we typically forecast our operational currency needs  purchase such currency on the open market at the beginning of an operational period  and hold these funds as a hedge against currency fluctuations 
we usually limit the operational period to months or less 
because we do not engage in foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation risk management techniques beyond these periods  our cost structure is subject to long term changes in foreign exchange rates 
while we expect to continue to use this method to manage our foreign currency risk  in the future we may decide to use foreign exchange contracts to manage this risk 
we regularly analyze the sensitivity of our foreign exchange positions to measure our foreign exchange risk 
at december   a shift in foreign exchange rates would not have materially impacted our foreign exchange income because our foreign currency net asset position was immaterial 
debt we issued  of convertible subordinated notes in august because we pay fixed interest coupons on our notes  market interest rate fluctuations do not impact our debt interest payments 
however  the fair value of our convertible subordinated notes will fluctuate as a result of changes in the price of our common stock  changes in market interest rates and changes in our credit worthiness 
our convertible subordinated notes are not listed on any securities exchange or included in any automated quotation system  but have been traded over the counter  on the portal market or under rule of the securities act of the exchange prices from these trades are not always available to us and may not be reliable 
trades under the portal market do not reflect all trades of the securities and the figures recorded are not independently verified 
the average bid and ask price of our convertible subordinated notes on the portal market on december  was per in face value  resulting in an aggregate fair value of approximately million 
there were no reported trades on december or december
