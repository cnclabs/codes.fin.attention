item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward looking statements due to certain factors  including those discussed in this management s discussion and analysis under the heading outlook  and in exhibit to this form k which is incoroporated herein by reference and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a leading producer of ion implantation  dry strip and photostabilization equipment used in the fabrication of semiconductors 
we also manufacture rapid thermal processing equipment  which is used in semiconductor manufacturing primarily before and after the ion implantation process 
in addition  we provide extensive aftermarket service and support  including spare parts  equipment upgrades  maintenance services and customer training 
we have a joint venture with sumitomo heavy industries  ltd 
in japan 
separation from eaton corporation prior to the initial public offering on july   we were a wholly owned subsidiary of eaton corporation eaton 
on june   eaton substantially completed the transfer to us of all of the assets of its semiconductor equipment operations that were not previously owned by us  and we assumed the related liabilities 
on december   eaton completed the divestiture of its investment in axcelis by distributing its remaining ownership interest in axcelis in the form of a spin off to eaton shareholders 
we also entered into various other agreements with eaton which provided for transitional services and support  including those associated with voice and data transmissions and other data related operations  accounts receivable  accounts payable  fixed assets  payroll  general accounting  financial accounting consolidation  cash management  human resources  tax  legal and real estate 
under these agreements  we reimbursed eaton for its direct and indirect costs of providing these services until completion of the divestiture  and thereafter  for a limited time  we reimbursed eaton for its costs plus an additional fee 
the transition periods covered by these agreements generally expired on december  the agreements did not necessarily reflect the costs of obtaining these services from unrelated third parties or of providing the applicable services in house 
however  management believed that purchasing these services from eaton provided an efficient means of obtaining these services during the transition period 
basis of presentation on june   eaton substantially completed the transfer of all the assets and related liabilities of its semiconductor equipment operations to us 
prior to the transfer  the financial statements of the semiconductor equipment operations were presented on a combined basis 
prior to the initial public offering  eaton did not account for or operate axcelis as a separate  stand alone entity and  as a result  the financial information included herein may not reflect what our consolidated financial position  operating results and cash flows would have been during the periods presented prior to the initial public offering  if we had been a separate  stand alone entity 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon axcelis consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  income taxes  accounts receivable  inventory and warranty and installation obligations 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following accounting policies are critical in that they both are most important for portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company s revenue recognition policy involves significant judgment by management 
the company s revenue recognition policy is described in detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
as note describes in detail  the company considers a broad array of facts and circumstances in determining when to recognize revenue  including the complexity of the customer s post delivery acceptance provisions and the installation process 
in the future  if the post delivery acceptance provisions and installation process become more complex or result in a materially lower rate of acceptance than we now experience  the company may have to revise its revenue recognition policy  which could affect the timing of revenue recognition 
deferred tax assets as of december   we have approximately million of deferred tax assets related principally to domestic loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards that expire at various times through  for which a million valuation allowance has been recorded 
the realization of these assets is based upon estimates of future taxable income 
projections of future earnings are based on revenue assumptions consistent with industry forecasts for the next three years along with the necessary operating expenses to support our revenue assumptions 
based on these projections  we estimate that the loss carryforwards will be fully utilized within three years 
we update these projections quarterly based on current industry trends and company specific events 
should trends within our industry or specific to the company cause our projections not to materialize and future taxable losses continue  a valuation allowance of up to million may be required 
such a valuation allowance  if required  would result in a non cash charge to earnings 
goodwill and other intangible assets we account for our acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting pursuant to statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 business combinations 
goodwill represents the excess of cost over net assets  including all identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses that are consolidated 
pursuant to sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is not amortized 
other intangible assets that are separable from goodwill and have determinable useful lives are valued separately and amortized over their useful lives 
such other identifiable intangible assets consist mainly of developed technology and are generally amortized over approximately ten years 
we have determined that all of our intangible assets have finite lives 
during  in accordance with sfas no 
 we ceased to amortize goodwill arising primarily from our acquisition of our curing and cleaning business 
in lieu of amortization  we perform an impairment review of our goodwill 
impairment tests are performed annually  or more frequently if there are other indicators of impairment the annual impairment test consists of determining the fair market value of the business unit through a discounted cash flow analysis 
management s best judgments are employed in determining future market conditions that impact this discounted cash flow analysis 
as a result of our annual review  we determined that there was no impairment of our goodwill as of december  in the future  we will conduct an annual impairment review 
if we determine through the impairment review process that goodwill has been impaired  we would record the impairment charge in our statement of operations as a non cash charge to earnings 
net goodwill amounted to million as of december  we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following a significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  a significant change in the manner of our use of the acquired asset or the strategy for our overall business  a significant negative industry or economic trend  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
as part of this assessment  we would review the expected future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles may not be recoverable  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
net intangible assets amounted to million as of december  accounts receivable axcelis records an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of axcelis customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be necessary 
inventory axcelis records an allowance for estimated excess and obsolete inventory 
the allowance is based upon management s assumptions of future materials usage and obsolescence  which are a result of future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions become less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
product warranty and installation costs axcelis provides for the estimated cost of product warranties and installations at the time of shipment 
the company s warranty and installation obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service labor costs incurred in correcting a product failure or installing a system at a customer s site 
if actual product failure rates  material usage or service labor costs differ from management s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty and installation liability may be required

liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december  were million  compared to million at december  the increase in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments between years was due mainly to the net proceeds of million received from the company s convertible subordinated note offering in january offset by cash used in operations of million and purchases of plant and equipment of million 
net working capital was million at december  as compared to net working capital of million at december  the increase in net working capital was due mainly to the increase in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december  compared to december  cash used by operating activities was million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal the cash used by operating activities for fiscal was primarily due to the company s pre tax loss 
capital expenditures were million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in capital expenditures was principally due to the completion of the company s addition to its beverly  massachusetts facility during the first fiscal quarter of the amount of future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including the timing and rate of the expansion of our business 
net cash provided by financing activities amounted to million in fiscal due mainly to the company s completion of an offering in january of million of convertible subordinated notes the notes  which mature on january  interest on the notes is payable on january and july of each year  commencing july  the notes are convertible into shares of axcelis common stock at any time prior to the close of business on the maturity date  unless previously redeemed  at a conversion price of per share  subject to certain adjustments 
the notes are redeemable  in whole or in part  at the option of the company beginning on january  with at least days notice at redemption prices starting at and at diminishing prices thereafter  plus accrued interest 
the notes are unsecured and subordinated in right of payment in full to all existing and future senior indebtedness  as defined  of the company 
in the fourth quarter of  the company established a million secured  three year revolving credit facility comprised of a million  day tranche and a million  three year tranche 
the million  day tranche was renewed in the fourth quarter of in january  the overall facility was increased to million and is comprised of a million  day tranche and a million  three year tranche 
the purpose of this facility is to provide funds for working capital and general corporate purposes 
borrowings under this credit arrangement are limited to the lesser of million or the sum of a percentage of certain eligible domestic accounts receivable and inventory and bear interest at libor plus an applicable spread 
there are no borrowings currently outstanding under this facility 
the facility contains certain financial and other restrictive covenants including minimum profitability  liquidity and leverage ratios as well as maximum capital expenditure levels

outlook the company s performance in fiscal year was directly related to the continuing low levels of capital expenditures by semiconductor manufacturers  especially manufacturers opening new or expanding existing fabrication facilities 
the level of capital expenditures by these manufacturers depends upon the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and the products utilizing them  the available manufacturing capacity in manufacturers fabrication facilities  and the ability of manufacturers to increase productivity in existing facilities without incurring additional capital expenditures 
currently  management believes that its customers see limited growth in important end markets such as telecommunications and personal computers 
as a result  management took actions to reduce manufacturing costs  research and development expense and sg a expense during on january   the company announced its expectation that its revenues for the first quarter of fiscal will be in the range of to million  an increase over the million in revenues that the company reported in the fourth quarter of on these forecast revenues  management stated on january  that gross margins would be approximately and the net loss for the first quarter of fiscal was expected to be to per share 
management is continuing to manage the company s cost structure on a quarterly basis with the objective of improving profitability  while at the same time making sure that the company has the right resources for an upturn in demand for its systems 
it is difficult for us to predict our customers capital spending plans  which can change very quickly 
in addition  at our current sales level  each sale  or failure to make a sale  could have a material effect on us in a particular quarter 
risk factors as defined under safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  some of the matters discussed in this filing contain forward looking statements regarding future events that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
the following important factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those described by such statements 
these factors include  but are not limited to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  our ability to keep pace with rapid technological changes in semiconductor manufacturing processes  the highly competitive nature of the semiconductor equipment industry  quarterly fluctuations in operating results attributable to the timing and amount of orders for our products and services  dependence on sen our japanese joint venture for access to the japanese semiconductor equipment market  and those risk factors contained in the section titled outlook and exhibit of this form k 
if any of those risk factors actually occurs  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed and the trading price of our common stock could decline 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity axcelis exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio  which consists entirely of cash equivalents and short term investments as of december  the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
this is accomplished by investing in marketable high investment grade securities  and by limiting exposure to any one issue or issuer 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in managing our investment portfolio and  due to the nature of our investments  we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by any change in market interest rates 
as of december   all investments mature within days and are carried at cost  which approximates fair value 
foreign currency exchange risk prior to our separation from eaton  our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk was managed on an enterprise wide basis as part of eaton s risk management strategy 
we now manage our exchange rate risk on an independent basis 
currently  substantially all of our sales are billed in us dollars  thereby reducing the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on our results 
our investment in sen and our royalty and equity income from sen are subject to foreign currency exchange risks 
the effect of a depreciation of the japanese yen compared to the us dollar would result in a write down in the company s investment in sen and a corresponding increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss included in stockholders equity of million at december
