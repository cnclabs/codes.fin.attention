on many of our products we offer multiple value choices in a good better best assortment  with appropriate price and quality increases from the good products to the better and best products 
we believe that our overall prices compare favorably to those of our competitors 

table of contents marketing we believe that targeted advertising and marketing play important roles in succeeding in today s environment 
we are constantly working to understand our customers wants and needs so that we can build long lasting  loyal relationships 
we utilize marketing and advertising primarily to educate customers about the overall importance of vehicle maintenance

maintenance products  accessories and miscellaneous items are attractively displayed for easy browsing by customers 
in store signage and special displays promote products in floor displays  endcaps and on the shelf 
store managers are able to customize areas of the store to prominently display products that are in demand in the local community 
az commercial we believe we are the third largest aftermarket seller of automotive parts and products to repair shops in the united states 
az commercial is our program that sells parts and other products to local  regional and national repair garages  dealers and service stations 
as a part of the program we offer credit and delivery to some of our commercial customers 
the program operated out of  stores as of august  through our hub stores  we offer a greater range of parts and products desired by professional technicians and can also be used as additional available inventory for local stores 
in addition  some of our commercial customers receive shipments directly from our distribution centers 
az commercial has a national sales team focused on national and regional commercial accounts  as well as an outside sales force for customers located immediately around our commercial stores 

table of contents store operations store formats as of august   we had domestic auto parts stores in the following square footage ranges square footage number of stores less than   to  more than  substantially all autozone stores are based on standard store formats resulting in generally consistent appearance  merchandising and product mix 
approximately to of each store s square footage is selling space  of which approximately to is dedicated to hard parts inventory 
the hard parts inventory area is generally fronted by a counter or pods that run the depth or length of the store  dividing the hard parts area from the remainder of the store 
the remaining selling space contains displays of accessories and maintenance items 
we have knowledgeable autozoners available to assist customers with their parts needs utilizing our proprietary electronic parts catalog with a display screen that is visible to both the autozoner and the customer 
in addition to helping ensure fast  accurate parts lookup  the parts catalog will suggest additional items that a customer should purchase in order to properly install the merchandise being purchased 
we believe that our stores are destination stores  generating their own traffic rather than relying on traffic created by adjacent stores 
therefore  we situate most stores on major thoroughfares with easy access and good parking 
approximately  of our auto parts stores are freestanding  with the balance principally located within strip shopping centers 
freestanding large format stores typically have parking for approximately to cars on a lot of approximately to one acre 
our smaller stores typically have parking for approximately to cars and are usually located on a lot of approximately to acre 
store personnel and training each auto parts store typically employs from to autozoners  including a manager and  in some cases  an assistant manager

in addition  our growth has provided opportunities for the promotion of qualified autozoners 
we believe these opportunities are important to attract  motivate and retain quality autozoners 
our domestic auto parts stores are primarily supervised through district managers who oversee approximately to stores each and who report to regional managers 
regional managers with approximately to stores each  in turn  report to five vice presidents of operations 
all store support functions are centralized in our store support center in memphis  tennessee 
we believe that this centralization enhances consistent execution of our merchandising and marketing strategies at the store level  while reducing expenses and cost of sales 
store automation all of our stores have a proprietary electronic parts catalog that provides parts information based on the make  model and year of an automobile 
the catalog display screens are placed on the hard parts counter or pods where both autozoners and customers can view the screen 
in addition  our satellite system enables the stores to expedite credit or debit card and check approval processes  immediately access national warranty data  implement real time inventory controls and locate and hold parts at neighboring autozone stores 
our domestic auto parts stores utilize our computerized store management system  which includes bar code scanning and point of sale data collection terminals 
the store management system provides administrative assistance and improved personnel scheduling at the store level  as well as enhanced merchandising information and improved inventory control 
we believe the store management system also enhances customer service through faster processing of transactions and simplified warranty and product return procedures 
store development the following table reflects domestic auto parts store development during the past five fiscal years fiscal year beginning stores new stores replaced stores closed stores net new stores ending stores 
table of contents we believe that expansion opportunities exist both in markets that we do not currently serve  and in markets where we can achieve a larger presence 
we attempt to obtain high visibility sites in high traffic locations and undertake substantial research prior to entering new markets 
the most important criteria for opening a new store are its projected future profitability and its ability to achieve our required investment hurdle rate 
key factors in selecting new site and market locations include population  demographics  vehicle profile  number and strength of competitors stores and the cost of real estate 
in reviewing the vehicle profile  we also consider the number of vehicles that are seven years old and older  our kind of vehicles okvs  as these are no longer under the original manufacturers warranty and will require more maintenance and repair than younger vehicles 
we generally seek to open new stores within or contiguous to existing market areas and attempt to cluster development in new urban markets in a relatively short period of time to achieve economies of scale in distribution and marketing costs 
in addition to continuing to lease or develop our own stores  we may occasionally evaluate potential acquisition candidates 
purchasing and supply chain merchandise is selected and purchased for all stores through our store support center in memphis  tennessee 
no one class of product accounts for as much as percent of our total sales 
in fiscal  no single supplier accounted for more than percent of our total purchases 
we generally have few long term contracts for the purchase of merchandise 
we believe that we have excellent relationships with suppliers 
we also believe that alternative sources of supply exist  at similar cost  for substantially all types of product sold 
our vendors ship substantially all of our merchandise to our distribution centers 
stores typically place orders on a weekly basis with merchandise shipped from the warehouse generally within hours of receipt of the order 
our hub stores have increased our ability to distribute products on a timely basis to each store 
a hub store is able to provide replenishment of sold products and deliver special order products to a store in its coverage area generally within hours 
hub stores are replenished from distribution centers multiple times per week

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations for an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the past three fiscal years  this financial review should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements presented in this form k

same store sales  or sales for domestic stores open at least one year  increased approximately during the year  including flat retail same store sales and an increase for commercial sales in same stores by approximately

comparable operating profit for fiscal increased by  as operating margin improved percentage points to from last year see reconciliation of non gaap financial measures 
the improvements in gross profit and gross margin reflect the additive impact of new merchandise  a reduction in our product warranty expense  and the benefit of more strategic and disciplined pricing derived from our category management system 
improvements  in operating profit and operating margin  reflect our relentless expense discipline  in particular  the leveraging of salaries and information technology spending during fiscal net interest expense for fiscal was million compared with million during fiscal the increase in interest expense for fiscal was primarily due to higher levels of debt compared with the fiscal year 
weighted average borrowings for fiscal were billion  compared with billion for fiscal  and  weighted average borrowing rates  excluding the impact of debt amortization and facility fees  remained relatively flat at for both fiscal years

comparable store sales increased in fiscal as a result of an increase in customer count and an increase in average dollars spent per transaction over the amounts in the fiscal year

gross margin improvement for fiscal reflected lower product costs  more efficient supply chain costs  reduced inventory shrinkage  the benefits of more strategic and disciplined pricing due to category management and the addition of more value added  high margin merchandise than in the fiscal year 
operating  selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased by million over such expenses for fiscal but declined as a percentage of net sales from to 
the improved ratio reflected the fact that revenues rose more rapidly than the growth of store level expenses a percentage point improvement  combined with operating savings resulting from the restructuring in fiscal related to controlling staffing  base salaries and technology spending of percentage points

table of contents inflation autozone does not believe its operations have been materially affected by inflation 
we have been successful  in many cases  in mitigating the effects of merchandise cost increases principally through efficiencies gained through economies of scale  selective forward buying and the use of alternative suppliers 
seasonality and quarterly periods autozone s business is somewhat seasonal in nature  with the highest sales occurring in the summer months of june through august  in which average weekly per store sales historically have been about to higher than in the slower months of december through february 
during short periods of time  a store s sales can be affected by weather conditions 
extremely hot or extremely cold weather may enhance sales by causing parts to fail and spurring sales of seasonal products 
mild or rainy weather tends to soften sales as parts failure rates are lower in mild weather and elective maintenance is deferred during periods of rainy weather 
over the longer term  the effects of weather balance out  as we have stores throughout the united states 
each of the first three quarters of autozone s fiscal year consists of weeks  and the fourth quarter consists of weeks weeks in fiscal 
because the fourth quarter contains the seasonally high sales volume and consists of weeks weeks in fiscal  compared with weeks for each of the first three quarters  our fourth quarter represents a disproportionate share of the annual net sales and net income 
the fourth quarter of fiscal represented of annual net sales and of net income  the fourth quarter of fiscal  represented of annual net sales and of net income 
fiscal consisted of weeks  with the fiscal fourth quarter including weeks 
accordingly  the fourth quarter of fiscal included the benefit of an additional week of net sales of million and net income of million 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal cash flow generated from store operations provides us with a significant source of liquidity 
our new store development program requires working capital  predominantly for inventories 
during the past three fiscal year periods  we have improved our accounts payable to inventory ratio to at august   from at august   and at august  in each of the three year periods  the improvement in this ratio was a source of cash from operations  particularly in fiscal when the ratio increased percentage points 
the increase in merchandise inventories  required to support new store development and sales growth  has largely been financed by our vendors  as evidenced by the higher accounts payable to inventory ratio 

table of contents autozone s primary capital requirement has been the funding of its continued new store development program 
from the beginning of fiscal to august   we have opened net new domestic auto parts stores 
net cash flows used in investing activities were million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in cash used in investing activities during fiscal as compared to fiscal is due primarily to increased store development activities in the current year and proceeds from the sale of the truckpro business in the prior year 
we invested million in capital assets in fiscal compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal new store openings in the us were for fiscal  for fiscal and for fiscal during fiscal  we sold truckpro  our heavy duty truck parts subsidiary  which operated stores  for cash proceeds of million 
proceeds from capital asset disposals totaled million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the net cash used in financing activities is primarily attributable to purchases of treasury stock which totaled million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal fiscal net proceeds from the issuance of debt securities  including repayments on other debt and the net change in commercial paper borrowings  offset the increased level of treasury stock purchases by approximately million 
we expect to open approximately new stores during fiscal our new store development program requires working capital  predominantly for inventories 
historically  we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers  reducing the working capital required by expansion 
we believe that we will be able to continue to finance much of our inventory requirements through favorable payment terms from suppliers 
depending on the timing and magnitude of our future investments either in the form of leased or purchased properties or acquisitions  we anticipate that we will rely primarily on internally generated funds to support a majority of our capital expenditures  working capital requirements and stock repurchases 
the balance will be funded through borrowings 
we anticipate that we will be able to obtain such financing in view of our credit rating and favorable experiences in the debt markets in the past 
credit ratings at august   autozone had a senior unsecured debt credit rating from standard poor s of bbb and a commercial paper rating of a moody s investors service had assigned us a senior unsecured debt credit rating of baa and a commercial paper rating of p as of august   both moody s and standard poor s had autozone listed as having a stable outlook 
subsequent to the fiscal year end  moody s changed our outlook to negative  while confirming autozone s existing credit ratings 
if our credit ratings drop  our interest expense may increase  similarly  we anticipate that our interest expense may decrease if our investment ratings are raised 
if our commercial paper ratings drop below current levels  we may have difficulty continuing to utilize the commercial paper market and our interest expense will 
table of contents increase  as we will then be required to access more expensive bank lines of credit 
if our senior unsecured debt ratings drop below investment grade  our access to financing may become more limited 
debt facilities we maintain million of revolving credit facilities with a group of banks 
of the million  million expires in may the remaining million expires in may the portion expiring in may includes a renewal feature as well as an option to extend the maturity date of the then outstanding debt by one year 
the credit facilities exist largely to support commercial paper borrowings and other short term unsecured bank loans 
at august   outstanding commercial paper of million  the notes due november of million and other debt of million are classified as long term  as we have the ability and intention to refinance them on a long term basis 
the rate of interest payable under the credit facilities is a function of the london interbank offered rate libor  the lending bank s base rate as defined in the agreement or a competitive bid rate at our option 
we have agreed to observe certain covenants under the terms of our credit agreements  including limitations on total indebtedness  restrictions on liens and minimum fixed charge coverage 
as of august   we are in compliance with all covenants 
on october   we issued million of senior notes 
the notes mature in october  and interest is payable semi annually on april and october a portion of the proceeds from these senior notes was used to prepay a million unsecured bank term loan due december  to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper borrowings  and to settle interest rate hedges associated with the issuance and repayment of the related debt securities 
on june   we issued million of senior notes 
these senior notes mature in june  and interest is payable semi annually on june and december the proceeds were used to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper borrowings  to prepay million of the million unsecured bank loan due november  and to settle interest rate hedges associated with the issuance of the debt securities 
on august   we filed a shelf registration with the securities and exchange commission  which was declared effective on august  this filing will allow us to sell up to million in debt securities to fund general corporate purposes  including repaying  redeeming or repurchasing outstanding debt  and for working capital  capital expenditures  new store openings  stock repurchases and acquisitions 
no debt had been issued under this registration statement as of august  all of the repayment obligations under our bank lines of credit may be accelerated and come due prior to the scheduled payment date if autozone experiences a change in control as defined in the agreements of autozone or its board of directors or if covenants are breached related to total indebtedness and minimum fixed charge coverage 
we expect to remain in compliance with these covenants 

table of contents stock repurchases as of august   our board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to billion of common stock in the open market 
from january to august   approximately billion of common stock had been repurchased 
during fiscal  we repurchased million of common stock 
at times in the past  we utilized equity forward agreements to facilitate our repurchase of common stock 
there were no outstanding equity forward agreements for share repurchases as of august  at august   we held equity forward agreements  which were settled in cash during fiscal  for the purchase of approximately million shares of common stock at an average cost of per share 
such obligations under equity forward agreements at august   were not reflected on our balance sheet 
financial commitments the following table shows autozone s obligations and commitments to make future payments under contractual obligations payment due by period total contractual less than between between over in thousands obligations year years years years long term debt operating leases construction obligations long term debt balances represent principal maturities  excluding interest 
at august   debt balances due in less than one year of million are classified as long term in our consolidated financial statements  as we have the ability and intention to refinance them on a long term basis 
operating lease obligations include related interest 
the following table shows autozone s other commitments which all have expiration periods of less than one year total other in thousands commitments standby letters of credit surety bonds off balance sheet arrangements the above table reflects the outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds as of august  a substantial portion of the outstanding standby letters of credit which are primarily 
table of contents renewed on an annual basis and surety bonds are used to cover reimbursement obligations to our workers compensation carriers 
there are no additional contingent liabilities associated with them as the underlying liabilities are already reflected in our balance sheet 
the letters of credit and surety bonds arrangements have automatic renewal clauses 
in conjunction with our commercial sales program  we offer credit to some of our commercial customers 
the receivables related to the credit program are sold to a third party at a discount for cash with limited recourse 
autozone has recorded a reserve for this recourse 
at august   the receivables facility had an outstanding balance of million and the balance of the recourse reserve was million 
guarantee and indemnification arrangements during fiscal  autozone adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
effective for interim and annual periods ending after december   fin elaborates on the disclosures that must be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees and indemnities 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize the fair value of guarantee and indemnification arrangements issued or modified by autozone after december   if these arrangements are within the scope of fin the adoption of fin did not have a significant impact on autozone s consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies product warranties limited warranties on certain products that range from days to lifetime warranties are provided to our customers by autozone or the vendors supplying its products 
warranty costs relating to merchandise sold under warranty not covered by vendors are estimated and recorded as warranty obligations at the time of sale based on each product s historical return rate 
we periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liability and adjust the amount as necessary 
litigation and other contingent liabilities we have received claims related to and been notified that we are a defendant in a number of legal proceedings resulting from our business  such as employment matters  product liability  general liability related to our store premises and alleged violation of the robinson patman act as specifically described in note m in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
generally  we calculate contingent loss accruals using our best estimate of our probable and reasonably estimable contingent liabilities  such as lawsuits and our retained liability for insured claims 

table of contents vendor allowances autozone receives various payments and allowances from its vendors based on the volume of purchases or for services that autozone provides to the vendors 
monies received from vendors include rebates  allowances and promotional funds 
typically these funds are dependent on purchase volumes and advertising plans 
the amounts to be received are subject to changes in market conditions  vendor marketing strategies and changes in the profitability or sell through of the related merchandise for autozone 
rebates and other miscellaneous incentives are earned based on purchases or product sales 
these monies are treated as a reduction of inventories and are recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as the inventories are sold 
certain vendor allowances are used exclusively for promotions and to partially or fully offset certain other direct expenses 
such vendor funding arrangements  that were entered into on or before december   were recognized as a reduction to selling  general and administrative expenses when earned 
however  for such vendor funding arrangements entered into or modified after december   autozone applied the new guidance pursuant to the emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for cash consideration received from a vendor eitf issue no 

accordingly  all such vendor funds are recognized as a reduction to cost of sales as the inventories are sold 
the new accounting pronouncement for vendor funding does not impact the way autozone runs its business or its relationships with vendors 
it does  however  require the deferral of certain vendor funding which is calculated based upon vendor inventory turns 
based on the timing of the issuance of the pronouncement and guidelines  we were precluded from adopting eitf issue no 
as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
our timing and accounting treatment of eitf issue no 
was not discretionary 
impairments in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amounts of long lived assets  such as property and equipment  covered by this standard whenever events or changes in circumstances dictate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
as part of the evaluation  we review performance at the store level to identify any stores with current period operating losses that should be considered for impairment 
we compare the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows with the carrying amounts of the assets 
under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  we perform an annual test of goodwill to compare the estimated fair value of goodwill to the carrying amount to determine if any impairment exists 
we perform the annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  unless circumstances dictate more frequent assessments 
if impairments are indicated by either of the above evaluations  the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets is recognized as an impairment 
table of contents loss 
such evaluations require management to make certain assumptions based upon information available at the time the evaluation is performed  which could differ from actual results 
restructuring and impairment charges in fiscal  autozone recorded restructuring and impairment charges of million  including restructuring accruals of million 
the accrued obligations for restructuring charges totaled approximately million at august   and million at august  the original charges and activity in the restructuring accruals is described more fully in note l in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal  we reevaluated remaining excess properties related to the fiscal impairment charges and determined that several properties could be developed 
this resulted in the reversal of accrued lease obligations totaling million 
we also determined that additional writedowns of million were needed to state remaining excess properties at fair value 
in addition  we recognized million of gains in fiscal as a result of closing certain stores associated with the restructuring and impairment charges in fiscal during fiscal  autozone recognized million of gains as a result of the disposition of properties associated with the restructuring and impairment charges in fiscal included in the fiscal impairment and restructure charges were asset writedowns and contractual obligations aggregating million related to the planned sale of truckpro  our heavy duty truck parts subsidiary 
in december  truckpro was sold to a group of investors for cash proceeds of million and a promissory note 
a deferred gain of million was recorded as part of the sale due to uncertainties associated with the realization of the gain 
during fiscal  the note was paid and certain liabilities were settled 
as a result  a total pre tax gain of million was recognized in income during fiscal as part of operating  selling  general and administrative expenses 
no other significant gains or charges are anticipated under the fiscal restructuring plan 
value of pension assets at august   the fair market value of autozone s pension assets was million  and the related accumulated benefit obligation was million 
on january   our defined benefit pension plans were frozen 
accordingly  plan participants earn no new benefits under the plan formulas  and no new participants may join the plans 
the material assumptions for fiscal are an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of and a discount rate of 
for additional information regarding autozone s qualified and non qualified pension plans refer to note j in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
fin clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin requires the consolidation of certain types of entities in which a company absorbs a majority of another entity s expected losses or residual returns  or both  as a result of ownership  contractual or other financial interests in the other entity 
these entities are called variable interest entities 
fin applies immediately to variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin must be applied at the end of periods ending after december  the company is currently evaluating the impact of fin and does not expect its adoption to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements 
risk factors we may not be able to increase sales by the same historic growth rates 
we have increased our domestic store count in the past five fiscal years  growing from  stores at august   to  stores at august   an average store count increase per year of 
in addition  a portion of our total sales increases each year resulted from increases in sales at existing stores 
we cannot provide any assurance that we can continue to open stores at historical rates or increase same store sales 
our business depends upon qualified employees 
at the end of fiscal  our consolidated employee count was approximately  we can not assure that we can continue to hire and retain qualified employees at current wage rates 
if we do not maintain competitive wages  our customer service could suffer by reason of a declining quality of our workforce or  alternatively  our earnings could decrease if we increase our wage rates 
if demand for our products slows  then our business may be materially affected 
demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors 
in the short term  it may depend upon the number of miles vehicles are driven annually  as higher vehicle mileage increases the need for maintenance and repair 
mileage levels may be affected by gas prices and other factors 

table of contents the number of vehicles in current service that are seven years old and older  as these vehicles are no longer under the original vehicle manufacturers warranty and will need more maintenance and repair than younger vehicles 
the weather  as vehicle maintenance may be disrupted due to catastrophic weather conditions impacting a wide geographic area 
the economy 
in periods of rapidly declining economic conditions  both diy and difm customers may defer vehicle maintenance or repair 
during periods of expansionary economic conditions  more of our diy customers may pay others to repair and maintain their cars instead of working on their own vehicles or they may purchase new vehicles 
for the long term  demand for our products may depend upon the quality of the vehicles manufactured by the original vehicle manufacturers and the length of the warranty or maintenance offered on new vehicles 
restrictions on access to diagnostic tools and repair information imposed by the original vehicle manufacturers or by governmental regulation 
if we are unable to compete successfully against other businesses that sell the products that we sell  we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline 
the sale of automotive parts  accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many areas  including name recognition  product availability  customer service  store location and price 
autozone competes in both the retail diy and commercial difm auto parts and accessories markets 
competitors include national and regional auto parts chains  independently owned parts stores  wholesalers and jobbers  repair shops  car washes and auto dealers  in addition to discount and mass merchandise stores  department stores  hardware stores  supermarkets  drugstores and home stores that sell aftermarket vehicle parts and supplies  chemicals  accessories  tools and maintenance parts 
although we believe we compete effectively on the basis of customer service  including the knowledge and expertise of our autozoners  merchandise quality  selection and availability  product warranty  store layout  location and convenience  and the strength of our autozone brand name  trademarks and service marks  some competitors may have competitive advantages  such as greater financial and marketing resources  larger stores with more merchandise  longer operating histories  more frequent customer visits and more effective advertising 
if we are unable to continue to develop successful competitive strategies  or if our competitors develop more effective strategies  we could lose customers and our sales and profits may decline 
if we cannot profitably increase market share in the commercial auto parts business  our sales growth may be limited 
although we are one of the largest sellers of auto parts in the commercial difm market  to increase commercial sales we must compete against automotive aftermarket jobbers and 
table of contents warehouse distributors  in addition to other auto parts retailers that have entered the commercial business 
although we believe we compete effectively on the basis of customer service  merchandise quality  selection and availability  and distribution locations  some automotive aftermarket jobbers and warehouse distributors have been in business for substantially longer periods of time than we have  have developed long term customer relationships and have larger available inventories 
we can make no assurances that we can profitably develop new commercial customers or make available inventories required by commercial customers 
if our vendors continue to consolidate  we may pay higher prices for our merchandise 
recently  several of our vendors have merged and others have announced plans to merge 
further vendor consolidation could limit the number of vendors from which we may purchase products and could materially affect the prices we pay for these products 
consolidation among our competitors may negatively impact our business 
recently  several large auto parts chains have merged 
we do not know the impact these mergers will have upon competition in the retail automotive aftermarket 
if our competitors are able to achieve efficiencies in their mergers  then there may be greater competitive pressures in the markets in which they are stronger 
war or acts of terrorism or the threat of either may negatively impact availability of merchandise and adversely impact our sales 
war  or acts of terrorism or the threat of either  may have a negative impact on our ability to obtain merchandise available for sale in our stores 
some of our merchandise is imported from other countries 
if imported goods become difficult or impossible to bring into the united states  and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs  our sales and profit margins may be negatively affected 
in the event that commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed  our business may be adversely impacted  as we may have difficulty shipping merchandise to our distribution centers and stores

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk autozone is exposed to market risk from  among other things  changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and fuel prices 
from time to time  we use various financial instruments to reduce such risks 
to date  based upon our current level of foreign operations  hedging costs and past changes in the associated foreign exchange rates  no instruments have been utilized to reduce this market risk 
all of our hedging activities are governed by guidelines that are authorized by our board of directors 
further  we do not buy or sell financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate risk autozone s financial market risk results primarily from changes in interest rates 
at times  we reduce our exposure to changes in interest rates by entering into various interest rate hedge instruments such as interest rate swap contracts  treasury lock agreements and forward starting interest rate swaps 
autozone has utilized interest rate swaps to convert variable rate debt to fixed rate debt 
at august   we held an interest rate swap contract  with a september maturity date  to hedge million of variable rate debt associated with commercial paper borrowings 
at august   we also held treasury lock agreements with notional amounts of million and forward starting interest rate swaps with notional amounts of million 
these agreements  which expire in november  are used to hedge the exposure to variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in variable interest rates relating to anticipated debt transactions 
it is expected that upon settlement of the agreements  the realized gain or loss will be deferred in other comprehensive income and reclassified to interest expense over the life of the underlying debt 
in addition  during fiscal  we entered into and settled a forward starting interest rate swap with a notional amount of million  used to hedge the variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in variable interest rates related to autozone s issuance of million senior notes 
the loss realized upon settlement was deferred in other comprehensive income and is being reclassified to interest expense over the life of the underlying senior notes  resulting in an effective interest rate of 
at august   we held interest rate swap contracts related to million of variable rate debt 
of the million  million of the swaps  due in december  were used to hedge the variable rate debt associated with autozone s million term loan 
the remaining million of swaps  with expiration dates throughout fiscal years and  were designated to hedge the variable rate debt associated with commercial paper borrowings 
additionally  at august   we held treasury lock agreements with notional amounts of million that expired in october and hedged the exposure to variability in future cash flows resulting from changes in variable interest rates related to autozone s issuance of million senior notes 
the loss realized upon settlement was deferred in other comprehensive income and is being reclassified to interest expense over the life of the underlying senior notes  resulting in an effective interest rate of 
a portion of the proceeds generated 
table of contents from the issuance of the senior notes was used to prepay a million term loan 
accordingly  the related interest rate swap agreements were settled in cash and the realized loss was deferred in other comprehensive income and is being reclassified to interest expense over the life of the underlying term loan 
autozone reflects the current fair value of all interest rate hedge instruments on our balance sheet 
the related gains or losses on these transactions are deferred in stockholders equity as a component of other comprehensive income or loss 
these deferred gains and losses are recognized in income in the period in which the related interest rates being hedged are recognized in expense 
however  to the extent that the change in value of an interest rate hedge instrument does not perfectly offset the change in the value of the interest rate being hedged  that ineffective portion is immediately recognized in income 
for the years ended august   and august   all of our hedge instruments were determined to be highly effective  and no ineffective portion was recognized in income 
the fair values of the interest rate hedge instruments at august   were an asset of million 
the fair values of the interest rate hedge instruments at august   were a liability of million 
the fair value of autozone s debt was estimated at billion as of august   and billion as of august   based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar debt issues or on the current rates available to autozone for debt of the same remaining maturities 
such fair value is greater than the carrying value of debt at august   by million  and greater than the carrying value of debt at august   by million 
we had million of variable rate debt outstanding at august   and million outstanding at august   both of which exclude the effect of interest rate swaps designated and effective as cash flow hedges of such variable rate debt 
at these borrowing levels for variable rate debt  a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have had an unfavorable impact on autozone s pretax earnings and cash flows of million in and million in fiscal  which includes the effects of interest rate swaps 
the primary interest rate exposure on variable rate debt is based on libor 
we had million of fixed rate debt outstanding at august  a one percentage point increase in interest rates would reduce the fair value of autozone s fixed rate debt of million 
fuel price risk fuel swap contracts utilized by autozone have not previously been designated as hedging instruments under the provisions of sfas and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment  although the instruments were executed to economically hedge the consumption of diesel fuel used to distribute our products 
accordingly  mark to market gains and losses related to such fuel swap contracts are recorded in cost of sales as a component of distribution costs 
as of august   no fuel swap contracts were outstanding 
during fiscal  we entered into fuel swaps to economically hedge a portion of our diesel fuel exposure between april and august these swaps were settled prior to august   and had no significant impact on cost of sales for fiscal year
