part i item business 
general mcgrath rentcorp the company is a california corporation organized in the company is comprised of three business segments mobile modular management corporation mmmc  its modular building rental division  rentelco  its electronic test equipment rental division  and enviroplex  its majority owned subsidiary classroom manufacturing business 
the company s corporate offices are located in livermore  california 
in addition  branch operations for both rental divisions are conducted from this facility 
mmmc rents and sells modular buildings and accessories to fulfill customers temporary and permanent space needs in california and texas 
these units are used as temporary offices adjacent to existing facilities  and are used as classrooms  sales offices  construction field offices  health care clinics  child care facilities and for a variety of other purposes 
mmmc purchases the relocatable modular buildings  or modulars  from various manufacturers who build them to mmmc s design specifications 
mmmc operates from two branch offices in california and one in texas 
although mmmc s primary emphasis is on rentals  sales of modulars routinely occur and can fluctuate quarter to quarter and year to year depending on customer demands and requirements 
the educational market is the largest segment of the modular business 
mmmc provides classroom and specialty space needs serving schools from pre school to post secondary grade levels 
fueled by increasing student population  insufficient funding for new school construction and aging school facilities  demand continues to be very strong in california 
within the educational market  rentals and sales to california public school districts by mmmc represent a significant portion of mmmc s total revenues 
rentelco rents and sells electronic test equipment nationally from two locations 
the plano  texas location houses the company s communications and fiber optic test equipment inventory  calibration laboratory and eastern us sales engineer and operations staffs 
the livermore  california location houses the company s general purpose test equipment inventory  calibration laboratory and western us sales engineer and operations staffs 
significant portions of rentelco s rental and sale revenues are derived from the telecommunications industry 
rentelco continues to be affected by the severe and prolonged broad based weakness in the telecommunications industry  which has significantly impacted the company s overall revenues 
communications and fiber optic test equipment is utilized by field technicians  engineers and installer contractors in evaluating voice  data and multimedia communications networks  installing optical fiber cabling and in the development of switch  network and wireless products 
rentelco rents this test equipment primarily to network systems companies  electrical contractors  local long distance carriers and manufacturers of communications transmission equipment 
rentelco s communications equipment includes a broad spectrum of products from over different manufacturers domestically and abroad 
engineers  scientists and technicians utilize general purpose test equipment in evaluating the performance of their own electrical and electronic equipment  developing products  controlling manufacturing processes and in field service applications 
these instruments are rented primarily to electronics  industrial  research and aerospace companies 
the majority of rentelco s general purpose equipment is manufactured by agilent formerly hewlett packard and tektronix 
mcgrath rentcorp owns of enviroplex  a california corporation organized in enviroplex manufactures portable classrooms built to the requirements of the california division of the state architect dsa and sells directly to california public school districts 
enviroplex conducts its sales and manufacturing operations from its facility located in stockton  california 
since inception  mcgrath rentcorp has assisted enviroplex in a variety of corporate functions such as accounting  human resources  facility improvements and insurance 
mcgrath rentcorp has not purchased significant quantities of manufactured product from enviroplex 
a significant portion of the company s total revenues is derived from the educational market 
within the educational market  the rental by mmmc and sale by enviroplex and mmmc of modulars to california public school districts for use as portable classrooms  restroom buildings and administrative offices for kindergarten through grade twelve k comprised approximately  and  of the company s consolidated rental and sales revenues for  and  respectively 
please see note to the consolidated financial statements on page for more information on the company s business segments 
as of december   the company had employees  of whom are primarily administrative and executive personnel  and the remaining are engaged in manufacturing or rental operations 
the operations of the company share common facilities  financing  senior management  and operating and accounting systems  which results in the efficient use of overhead 
each product line has its own sales and technical personnel 
no single customer has accounted for more than of the company s total revenues generated in any given year 
the company s business is not seasonal  except for the rental and sale of classrooms  which is heaviest in the several months prior to the opening of school each fall 
the company s common stock is traded on the nasdaq national market system under the symbol mgrc 
relocatable modular buildings description modulars are designed for use as temporary office space and may be moved from one location to another 
modulars vary from simple single unit construction site offices to multi modular facilities  complete with wood exteriors and mansard roofs 
the rental fleet includes a full range of styles and sizes 
mmmc considers its modulars to be among the most attractive and well designed available 
the units are constructed with wood siding  sturdily built and physically capable of a long useful life 
units are provided with installed heat  air conditioning  lighting  electricity and floor covering  and may have customized interiors including partitioning  carpeting  cabinetwork and plumbing facilities 
mmmc purchases new modulars from various manufacturers who build to mmmc s design specifications 
with the exception of enviroplex  none of the principal suppliers are affiliated with the company 
during  mmmc purchased of its modular product from one manufacturer 
mmmc believes that the loss of its primary manufacturer of modulars could have an effect on its operations since mmmc could experience higher prices and longer lead times for modular product until other manufacturers increased their capacity 
the modular product is manufactured to state building codes  has a low risk of obsolescence  and can be modified or reconfigured to accommodate a wide variety of customer needs 
historically  as state building codes have changed over the years  mmmc has continued to be able to use existing modular equipment  with minimal required upgrades  if any 
mmmc has no assurance that it will continue to be able to use existing modular equipment with minimal upgrades as building codes change in the future 
mmmc operates from three regional inventory centers serving large geographic areas in california and texas with in house infrastructure and operational capabilities to support quick and efficient repair  modification  and refurbishment of equipment for the next rental opportunity 
mmmc believes operating from large regional inventory centers results in better operating margins as operating costs are spread over a large installed customer base 
mmmc actively maintains and repairs its rental equipment  and management believes this insures the continued use of the modular product over its long life and  when sold  generates high sale proceeds relative to its capitalized cost 
when rental equipment returns from a customer  the necessary repairs and preventative maintenance are performed prior to its next rental 
making these expenditures for repair and maintenance throughout the equipment s life results in older equipment renting for similar rates as newer equipment 
management believes the condition of the equipment is a more significant factor in determining the rental rate and sale price than its age 
over the last three years  used equipment sold represented less than of rental equipment  and has been  on average  years old with sale proceeds averaging better than of the equipment s capitalized cost 
mmmc depreciates its rental equipment over years using a residual value effective january  and using an residual value prior to marketing mmmc s largest single demand is for temporary classroom and other educational space needs of public and private schools  colleges and universities 
management believes the demand for classrooms is caused by shifting and fluctuating school populations  the lack of state funds for new construction  the need for temporary classroom space during reconstruction of older schools and  several years ago  class size reduction see classroom rentals and sales to california public schools k below 
other customer applications include sales offices  construction field offices  health care facilities  sanctuaries and child care services 
industrial  manufacturing  entertainment and utility companies  as well as governmental agencies commonly use large multi modular complexes to serve their interim administrative and operational space needs 
the modular product offers customers quick  cost effective space solutions while conserving their capital 
the company s branch and corporate offices  with the exception of rentelco s plano facility and enviroplex s facility  are housed in various sizes of modulars 
since most of mmmc s customer requirements are to fill temporary space needs  mmmc s marketing emphasis is on rentals rather than sales 
mmmc attracts customers through its website at www 
mobilemodularrents 
com  extensive yellow page advertising  telemarketing and direct mail 
customers are encouraged to visit an inventory center to view different models on display and to see a branch office  which is a working example of a modular application 
because service is a major competitive factor in the rental of modulars  mmmc offers quick response to requests for information  assistance in the choice of a suitable size and floor plan  in house customization services  rapid delivery  timely installation and maintenance of its units 
customers are able to view and select inventory for quote on mmmc s website 
rentals rental periods range from one month to ten years with a typical rental period of eighteen months 
most rental agreements are operating leases that provide no purchase options  and when a rental agreement does provide the customer with a purchase option  it is generally on terms attractive to mmmc 
the customer is responsible for obtaining the necessary use permits and the costs of insuring the unit  transporting the unit to the site  preparation of the site  installation of the unit  dismantle and return delivery of the unit to one of mmmc s three inventory centers  and certain costs for customization 
mmmc maintains the units in good working condition while on rent 
upon return  the units are inspected for damage and customers are billed for items considered beyond normal wear and tear 
generally  the units are then repaired for subsequent use 
repair and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred and can include floor tile repairs  roof maintenance  cleaning  painting and other cosmetic repairs 
the costs of major refurbishment of equipment are capitalized to the extent the refurbishment significantly improves the quality and adds value or life to the equipment 
at december   mmmc had  new or previously rented modulars in its rental fleet with an aggregate original cost including accessories of million or an average cost per unit of  utilization is calculated each month by dividing the cost of rental equipment on rent by the total cost of rental equipment  excluding new equipment inventory and accessory equipment 
at december   fleet utilization was and average fleet utilization during was 
sales in addition to operating its rental fleet  mmmc sells modulars to customers 
these sales typically arise out of its marketing efforts for the rental fleet 
such sales can be of either new or used units from the rental fleet  which permits an orderly turnover of older units 
during  mmmc s largest sale of modulars was for new buildings to a county agency for approximately million 
this sale represented approximately of mmmc s sales  of the company s consolidated sales  and of the company s consolidated revenues 
mmmc provides limited day warranties on used modulars and passes through the manufacturers one year warranty on new units to its customers 
warranty costs have not been significant to mmmc s operations to date  and mmmc attributes this to its commitment to high quality standards and regular maintenance programs 
however  there can be no assurance that warranty costs will continue to be insignificant to mmmc s operations in the future 
in addition to mmmc s sales  the company s subsidiary  enviroplex  manufactures and sells dsa portable classrooms to school districts in california see classroom sales by enviroplex below 
competition management estimates the business of renting relocatable modular buildings is an industry that today has equipment on rent or available for rent in the united states with an aggregate original cost in excess of billion 
competition in the rental and sale of relocatable modular buildings is intense 
two national firms are engaged in the rental of modulars  have many offices throughout the country and may have substantially greater financial resources than mmmc 
several hundred other companies are estimated to operate regionally throughout the country 
mmmc operates primarily in california and texas 
significant competitive factors in the rental business include availability  price  service  reliability  appearance and functionality of the product 
mmmc markets high quality  well constructed and attractive modulars 
mmmc believes that part of the strategy for modulars should be to create facilities and infrastructure capabilities that its competitors cannot easily duplicate 
the company s facilities and related infrastructure enable it to modify modulars efficiently and cost effectively to meet its customers needs 
management s goal is to be more responsive at less expense 
management believes this strategy  together with its emphasis on prompt and efficient customer service  gives mmmc a competitive advantage 
mmmc is determined to offer quick response to requests for information  experienced assistance for the first time user  rapid delivery and timely maintenance of its units 
mmmc s efficiency and responsiveness continues to improve as procedures  processes and computer systems that control its internal operations are enhanced 
mmmc anticipates strong competition in the future and believes its process of improving its products and services is ongoing 
classroom sales by enviroplex enviroplex manufactures moment resistant  rigid steel framed portable classrooms built to the requirements of the dsa and sells directly to california public school districts 
the moment resistant  rigid steel framed classroom is engineered to have the structural columns support the weight of the building 
this offers the customer greater design flexibility as to overall classroom size and the placement of doors and windows 
enviroplex fabricates most of the structural steel component parts using only mill certified sheet steel 
enviroplex s standard designs have been engineered for strength and durability using lighter weight steel 
customers are offered a wide variety of dsa pre approved classroom sizes and features with market established pricing  saving them valuable time on their classroom project 
customization features include restrooms  computer lab setups  interior offices  cabinetwork and kitchen facilities 
during  enviroplex s largest sale was for million of new classrooms to a school district 
this sale represented of enviroplex s sales  of the company s consolidated sales and of the company s consolidated revenues 
all of enviroplex s sales occur in california  with most sales occurring directly with california public school districts 
since enviroplex s customers are predominantly california public school districts  enviroplex markets directly to these schools through telemarketing  targeted mailings and participation in the annual cash coalition for adequate school housing tradeshow 
enviroplex also attracts customers through its website at www 
enviroplexinc 
com where customers are able to view a variety of dsa approved floor plans 
customers are encouraged to tour the manufacturing facility to experience the production process and examine the quality product built 
competition in the manufacture of dsa classrooms is broad  intense  and highly competitive 
several manufacturers have greater capacity for production and have been in business longer than enviroplex 
larger manufacturers with greater capacity have a larger appetite for the standard classroom while enviroplex caters to schools requirements for more customized classrooms 
the remaining manufacturers are of a similar size or smaller and do not have the production capacity nor the financial resources of enviroplex 
enviroplex has simplified its manufacturing process through value engineering by changing materials  determining which components are made in house versus purchased  reducing the number of components and increasing the production efficiency at an overall lower cost without sacrificing quality 
enviroplex s strategy is to improve the quality and flexibility of its product 
enviroplex understands that in addition to quality classrooms that are competitively priced and delivered on time  its customers want choices in design flexibility and customization 
management believes enviroplex s niche in providing these additional features in its products gives it a competitive edge 
however  there can be no assurance that enviroplex will be able to continue to provide design flexibility and customization that can effectively compete in the market 
enviroplex provides a one year warranty on manufactured equipment 
warranty costs have not been significant to enviroplex s operations to date  which can be attributed to enviroplex s dedication to manufacturing and delivering a quality  problem free product 
however  there can be no assurance that warranty costs will continue to be insignificant to enviroplex s operations in the future 
enviroplex purchases raw materials from a variety of suppliers 
each component part has multiple suppliers 
enviroplex believes the loss of any one of these suppliers would not have a material adverse affect on its operations 
classroom rentals and sales to california public schools k the rental and sales of modulars to california public school districts for use as portable classrooms  restroom buildings and administrative offices for kindergarten through grade twelve k are a significant portion of the company s revenues 
the following table shows the approximate percentages of the company s modular rental and sales revenues  and of its consolidated rental and sales revenues for the past five years  that rentals and sales to these schools constitute rentals and sales to california public schools k as a percentage of total rental and sales revenues percentage of modular rental revenues mmmc modular sales revenues mmmc enviroplex consolidated rental and sales revenues consolidated rental and sales revenue percentage is calculated by dividing modular rental and sales revenues by the company s consolidated rental and sales revenues 
the elevated modular sales percentage shown for can be attributed to the class size reduction program instituted by the state of california 
school districts were given great incentive to reduce class size in the lower grades from students to no greater than students 
this highly popular program created a great demand for both purchasing and renting classroom buildings and was essentially implemented by the end of in  the increased modular sales percentages resulted from new requirements beyond class size reduction by school districts 
the great majority of funding for facility requirements in california s public schools k and community colleges is derived from the passage of both statewide and local facility bond measures 
historically  the company has benefited from the passage of these types of facility bonds and believes these are essential to its business 
looking forward  the company believes that any interruption in the passage of these types of facility bonds  contraction of the class size reduction program  a lack of fiscal funding  or a significant reduction of funding from the state of california to public schools may have a material adverse effect on both rental and sale revenues of the company 
legislation in california where most of the company s educational rentals have occurred  school districts are permitted to purchase only portable classrooms built to the requirements of the dsa 
however  school districts may rent classrooms that meet either the department of housing doh or dsa requirements 
in  california adopted a law which limited the term for which school districts may rent portable classrooms built to doh standards for up to three years under a waiver process  and also required the school board to indemnify the state against any claims arising out of the use of such classrooms 
prior to the majority of the classrooms in the company s rental fleet were built to the doh requirements  and since almost all new classrooms have been built to the dsa requirements 
during the s additional legislation was passed extending the use of these doh classroom buildings under the waiver process through september  in  new california legislation was passed allowing for doh classroom buildings already in use for classroom purposes as of may  to be utilized until september   provided various upgrades were made to their foundation and ceiling systems 
school districts initially had until august  and then december  to make the necessary modifications to extend their usage of these buildings 
to the extent that school districts have not retrofitted these buildings and return the equipment  rental income levels could be impacted negatively 
currently  regulations and policies are in place that allow for the ongoing use of doh classrooms from the company s inventory to meet shorter term space needs of school districts for periods up to months  provided they receive a temporary certification or temporary exemption from the dsa 
as a consequence  the tendency is for school districts to rent the doh classrooms for shorter periods and to rent the dsa classrooms for longer periods 
at december   the net book value of doh classrooms represented less than of the net book value of the company s modular rental equipment and of the total assets of the company  and the utilization of these doh classrooms was 
electronic test and measurement instruments description rentelco s communications and fiber optics rental inventory includes fiber  telecom  sonet  atm  broadcast  copper  line simulator  microwave  network and transmission test equipment 
the general purpose inventory includes oscilloscopes  amplifiers  spectrum  network and logic analyzers  catv  component measurement  industrial  signal source  microprocessor development and power source test equipment 
rentelco s communications inventory includes equipment from over manufacturers and the majority of the general purpose inventory is manufactured by agilent formerly hewlett packard and tektronix 
rentelco also rents electronic instruments from other rental companies and re rents the instruments to customers 
during the first six months of  rentelco recorded noncash impairment charges of million resulting from the depressed and low projected demand for its rental products coupled with high inventory levels  especially communications equipment 
rentelco s business activity levels are directly attributable to the severe and prolonged broad based weakness in the telecommunications industry 
rentelco has limited visibility as to when the recovery in this sector will occur  and there can be no assurance as to the effect of such recovery on rentelco s operations 
at december   rentelco had an aggregate cost of electronics rental inventory and accessories of million 
utilization is calculated each month by dividing the cost of the rental equipment on rent by the total cost of the rental equipment  excluding accessory equipment 
utilization was as of december  and averaged during the year 
generally  rentelco targets utilization levels in a range between and 
there can be no assurance that in the future rentelco s utilization levels will reach rentelco s target utilization levels or even remain at their average 
rentelco rents electronic test equipment for a typical rental period of one to six months at monthly rental rates ranging from approximately to of the current manufacturers list price 
rentelco depreciates its equipment over to years with no residual value 
rentelco endeavors to maintain an inventory of equipment meeting more current technological standards and attempts to sell equipment so that the majority of the inventory is less than five years old 
rentelco generally sells used equipment after approximately four years of service to permit an orderly turnover and replenishment of the electronics inventory 
with weak market demand and lower than target utilization levels  rentelco will continue to sell rental equipment determined to be in excess of the required levels to meet projected customer rental demand 
there can be no assurance that rentelco will be successful in these efforts 
in  approximately of the electronics revenues were derived from sales 
the largest electronics sale during represented of electronics sales and less than of the company s consolidated sales and consolidated revenues 
market the business of renting electronic test and measurement instruments is an industry which today has equipment on rent or available for rent in the united states with an aggregate original cost in excess of a half billion dollars 
while there is a broad customer base for the rental of such instruments  most rentals are to electronics  communications  network systems  electrical contractor  installer contractor  industrial  research and aerospace companies 
rentelco markets its electronic equipment throughout the united states 
rentelco attracts customers through its website at www 
rentelco 
com  an extensive telemarketing program  trade show participation and direct mail campaigns 
rentelco believes that customers rent electronic test and measurement instruments for many reasons 
customers frequently need equipment for short term projects  for backup to avoid costly downtime and to evaluate new products 
delivery times for the purchase of such equipment can be lengthy  thus  renting allows the customer to obtain the equipment expeditiously 
rentelco also believes that a substantial portion of electronic test and measurement instruments are used for research and development projects where the relative certainty of rental costs can facilitate cost control and be useful in bidding for government contracts 
finally  as is true with the rental of any equipment  renting rather than purchasing may better satisfy the customer s budgetary constraints 
the industry consists primarily of three major companies 
rentelco competes with these major companies on the basis of product availability  price  service  and reliability 
however  all three companies are much larger than rentelco  may have substantially greater financial resources and are well established in the industry with a large inventory of equipment  several branch offices and experienced personnel  and there can be no assurance that rentelco will be able to compete effectively with these major companies in the future
