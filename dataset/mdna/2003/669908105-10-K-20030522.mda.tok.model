the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes and contingencies and litigation  on an ongoing basis 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements the company recognizes revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
under sab  revenue is recognized when the title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company recognizes revenues at time of shipment of its products and sales are recorded net of discounts and returns 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated bad debts 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their inability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
inventories are recorded at the lower of cost or market 
write downs of inventories to market value are based upon product franchise agreements governing price protection  stock rotation and obsolescence  as well as assumptions about future demand and market conditions

fiscal year versus results of continuing operations net sales for the year ended february  aggregated  as compared to  for the year ended february   an increase of  or approximately 
management attributes this increase in sales for the period to the core semiconductor and passive component distribution business  which has recently experienced a moderate increase in demand 
management believes that the current slowdown stabilized during the prior fiscal year and that market conditions have begun to marginally improve 
although the marketplace continues to afford poor visibility  management continues to believe that the first half of fiscal will continue to be flat or provide modest growth opportunities at best 
we are hopeful that the second half of fiscal will bring a return of low double digit growth patterns as the technology sector moves toward a substantial recovery  however  no assurances can be given in this regard 
gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was for the year ended february  as compared to for the year ended february  this continuing decrease in gross margin percentage reflects decreasing prices due to increased competitive pressures resulting from the industry wide decline in demand coupled with an oversupply of product in the marketplace 
the aforementioned reduction in margin percentage resulted in a  decrease in total gross margin dollars in fiscal in spite of the or  increase in sales 
management believes that the margin pressure during the first quarter of fiscal could continue for the balance of the first half of fiscal  with a return to relative margin stability in the second half of fiscal  however  no assurances can be given in this regard 
operating expenses decreased by  to  for the year ended february  from  for the year ended february   a decrease of approximately

net loss from continuing operations for the year ended february  was  or 
per share  as compared to a loss of  or 
per share for the year ended february  management attributes the fiscal loss of  to a continued reduction of gross margin dollars exceeding the reduction in operating and interest expense 
the  loss for fiscal is due to reduced sales volumes in excess of reductions in operating expenses  resulting in a loss of  and a one time charge for the impairment of the value of goodwill  which had previously been amortized over a fifteen year period  resulting in an additional  loss

the remaining decrease of approximately  or approximately of the total is a result of decreases in various other general and administrative expenses 
operating expenses as a percentage of sales  however  increased to of sales as compared to for the prior year 
the sharp reduction in sales has resulted in higher operating expenses as a percentage of sales and a loss of the economies of scale the company enjoyed in its prior fiscal year

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued interest expense decreased by  from  for the year ended february  to  for the year ended february  this decrease was primarily due to the lower average levels of bank debt during the year resulting from the decrease in the company s inventory and accounts receivable levels required to support reduced sales activity  repayment of indebtedness with the proceeds of the sale of the nu visions manufacturing nuv subsidiary and substantially lower interest rates overall

however  the company believes that there is a risk that  due to the overall decline in sales in the electronic components market  coupled with its decision to continue to invest both domestically and in the asian market  commencing in june  the company may violate the covenant related to minimum tangible net worth

the company anticipates that its resources provided by its cash flow from operations  without entering into the aforementioned agreement  will be sufficient to meet its financing requirements for at least the next twelve month period

item a 
market and other business risks the company s credit facility bears interest based on interest rates tied to the prime or libor rate  either of which may fluctuate over time based on economic conditions 
as a result  the company is subject to market risk for changes in interest rates and could be subjected to increased or decreased interest payments if market rates fluctuate and the company has borrowings outstanding under its line of credit 
the company has several foreign subsidiaries and acquires certain inventory from foreign suppliers and as such  faces risk due to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily the singapore dollar and the british pound 
these risks could have a material impact on the company s financial results in future periods 
the electronic component industry is cyclical which can cause significant fluctuations in sales  gross margins and profits  from year to year 
for example  during calendar  the industry experienced a severe decline in the demand for electronic components  which caused sales to decrease by 
the prior year reflected a increase in net sales 
it is difficult to predict the timing of the changing cycles in the electronic component industry
