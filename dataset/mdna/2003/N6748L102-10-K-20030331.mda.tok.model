general we design  develop  manufacture  market and distribute medical equipment  used principally by musculoskeletal medical specialists for orthopedic applications 
our main products are external and internal fixation devices used in fracture treatment  limb lengthening and bone reconstruction  and non invasive stimulation products used to enhance the success rate of spinal fusions and to treat non union fractures 
our products also include devices for removal of the bone cement used to fix artificial implants  the ultrasonic treatment of musculoskeletal pain  bracing products and a bone substitute compound 
we also produce a device for enhancing venous circulation 
we have administrative and training facilities in the united states  the united kingdom and italy and manufacturing facilities in the united states  the united kingdom  italy and seychelles 
we directly distribute our products in the united states  the united kingdom  ireland  italy  germany  switzerland  austria  france  belgium  mexico and brazil 
in these and other markets  we also distribute our products through independent distributors 
our revenues are generally derived from two primary sources sales of orthopedic and non orthopedic products 
sales of orthopedic products  including orthopedic devices  stimulation products and vascular products  accounted for of our total net sales in sales of non orthopedic products  including some vascular products and the laryngeal mask product  accounted for of our total net sales in we keep our books and records and account for net sales  costs and expenses in accordance with the geographic origination of our products 
the following table displays net sales by origination  net of intercompany eliminations  for the three most recent fiscal years ended december geographic origination year ended december  in us thousands percent of percent of percent of net sales total net sales net sales total net sales net sales total net sales americas    international    total    our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows are not significantly impacted by seasonality trends 
in addition  we do not believe our operations will be significantly affected by inflation or fluctuations in interest rates  although current lower interest rates did negatively affect interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents balances in see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
our consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the company and its wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries and entities over which the company has control 
all intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation 
the equity method of accounting is used when the company has significant influence over significant operating decisions but does not hold control 
under the equity method  original investments are recorded at cost and adjusted by the company s share of undistributed earnings or losses of these companies 
all material intercompany transactions and profits associated with the equity investees are eliminated in consolidation 
the results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statements of operations from the date of their acquisition or up to the date of their disposal 
our reporting currency is the united states dollar 
all balance sheet accounts  except shareholders equity  are translated at year end exchange rates  and revenue and expense items are translated at weighted average rates of exchange prevailing during the year 
gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in other income expense 
gains and losses resulting from the translation of foreign currency financial statements are recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of the shareholders equity 
in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations 
our objective is to limit the impact of such movements on earnings and cash flows 
in order to achieve this objective  we seek to balance non dollar income and expenditures 
we do not ordinarily use derivative instruments to hedge foreign exchange exposure 
critical accounting policies our discussion of operating results is based upon the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these statements necessarily requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
these estimates and assumptions form the basis for the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts  sales allowances and adjustments  inventories  investments  intangible assets and goodwill  income taxes  litigation and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions and believe our estimates for the carrying values of assets and liabilities are reasonable 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we have reviewed our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition for bone growth stimulation and bracing products  we recognize revenue when the product is placed on and accepted by the patient 
for sales to commercial customers  including hospitals and distributors  revenues are recognized at the time of shipment 
we derive a significant amount of our revenues in the united states from third party payors  including commercial insurance carriers  health maintenance organizations  preferred provider organizations and governmental payors such as medicare 
amounts paid by these third party payors are generally based on fixed or allowable reimbursement rates 
these revenues are recorded at the expected or pre authorized reimbursement rates  net of any contractual allowances or adjustments 
some billings are subject to review by such third party payors and may be subject to adjustment 
allowance for doubtful accounts and contractual adjustments in the judgment of management  adequate allowances have been provided for doubtful accounts and contractual adjustments 
these estimates are reviewed quarterly and periodically tested against actual collection experience 
the estimates are always subject to adjustment  which could be material 
inventory allowances we write down our inventory for inventory shrinkage and obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if conditions or assumptions used in determining these valuations change  additional inventory write down in the future would be necessary 
goodwill and other intangible assets we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january  the ongoing impact will be that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized  but instead tested at least annually for impairment 
we performed the impairment test of goodwill as required by sfas no 
and noted no impairment issues with the carrying value of goodwill as of december  tax matters we and each of our subsidiaries are taxed at the rates applicable within each of their respective jurisdictions 
the composite income tax rate  tax provisions  deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities will vary according to the jurisdiction in which profits arise 
further  certain of our subsidiaries sell products directly to our other subsidiaries or provide marketing and support services to our other subsidiaries 
these intercompany sales and support services involve subsidiaries operating in jurisdictions with differing tax rates 
the tax authorities in such jurisdictions may challenge our treatments under residency criteria  transfer pricing provisions  or other aspects of their respective tax laws  which could affect our composite tax rate and provisions

the americas unit covers the united states  mexico and brazil

participation of physicians who prescribe stimulation products in clinical studies with bmp s had an adverse impact on our stimulation sales growth in the second half of as physicians complete their participation in bmp clinical studies  we expect them to return in to their historic patterns of prescribing stimulation products 
stimulation products are sold almost exclusively in the united states  although we are attempting to expand distribution for stimulation products to europe and mexico

sales of vascular products grew to million in from million in this product is distributed in the united states by kendall healthcare products 
outside the united states  we expanded distribution of this product to several new markets

this authorization was renewed in february for another year 
in  we anticipate the use of cash for tangible and intangible capital expenditures to be approximately equivalent to the million of capital expenditures in during  executive plan options for  shares of common stock became fully vested 
the executive plan options have a per share exercise price of 
as of december    executive plan options have been exercised or cancelled 
remaining executive plan options expire by june if exercised prior to their expiration date  these remaining executive plan options will generate approximately million in proceeds for us

see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we continue to search for viable acquisition candidates that expand our worldwide presence as well as additional products appropriate for current distribution channels 
an acquisition of another company or product line by us could result in our incurrence of additional debt and contingent liabilities 
we believe that current cash balances together with projected cash flows from operating activities  the exercise of stock options and available debt capacity are sufficient to cover anticipated operating capital needs and research and development costs during the next two fiscal years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations and to the impact of changes in interest rates 
these fluctuations can vary sales and costs of operations  the cost of financing and yields on cash and short term investments 
our foreign currency exposure results from fluctuating currency exchange rates  primarily the us dollar against the euro  british pound  mexican peso and brazilian real 
we face transactional currency exposures when foreign subsidiaries or the company itself enter into transactions  generally on an intercompany basis  denominated in currencies other than their local currency 
we also face currency exposure from translating the results of our global operations into the us dollar at exchange rates that have fluctuated from the beginning of the period 
historically  we have not used financial derivatives to hedge against fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
based on our overall exposure for foreign currency at december   a hypothetical change in foreign currency rates would impact the company s balance sheet approximately million  net sales approximately million and net income and cash flows approximately million over a one year period 
our cash and cash equivalent balances and interest sensitive debt at december  were million and million 
based on such balances  a movement in interest rates would have a  and  effect on interest receivable and interest payable per year  respectively
