we conducted our first annual review for impairment of goodwill as of april  and recorded a non cash charge of million 
the impairment charge is attributable to our revised forecast for operating profits and cash flows and corresponds to the overall decline in our market capitalization 
licensing agreement with microsoft corporation on september  we entered into a licensing agreement with microsoft corporation whereby we granted microsoft a perpetual  non exclusive license to our operations manager product technology and source code for core operations management of windows and microsoft server applications 
we have received a total of million in license fees over a three year period starting november and ending august license revenue from the microsoft agreement was million during fiscal  million during fiscal  million during fiscal  and will be million in the first quarter of fiscal over the three year period  microsoft also agreed to spend million per year and pay us an additional million per year to market joint solutions of the parties

tender offers on november  we announced a voluntary stock option exchange program for our employees  excluding the chief executive officer  chief financial officer  chief operating officer  and chief technology officer 
the program was intended to balance the need to retain employees while minimizing dilution to stockholders 
the program reduced the term of re issued options to five years  generally restricted exercisability for six months following the re grant and  depending on the exercise price of the options tendered for exchange  gave employees fewer options than they had tendered 
on december   employees tendered options to purchase a total of  shares in connection with the offer  and new options for  shares were granted on june  at an exercise price of per share

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we believe there are several accounting policies that are critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements  as these policies affect the reported amounts of revenue and expenses  and involve management s judgment regarding significant estimates 
the critical accounting policies and estimates are described below 
revenue recognition revenue is generated from licensing software and providing services 
we recognize revenue in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  as set forth in american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  and aicpa sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  and securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  and other related pronouncements 
in accordance with these statements  revenue is recognized upon meeting each of the following criteria existence of persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
persuasive evidence generally is a purchase order  license agreement or other contract  delivery of product and authorization keys 
delivery has occurred when media containing the software is shipped or  in the case of electronic delivery  the customer is given access to the software  and the authorization keys are shipped or made available to the customer electronically  fee is fixed or determinable 
a fee is deemed to be fixed or determinable when it is not subject to subsequent refund or adjustment 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized when the fee becomes due and payable  collection is deemed probable  and vendor specific objective evidence exists to allocate the total fee to the elements of the arrangement 
software revenue is recognized using the residual method 
under the residual method revenue is recognized if vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for all of the undelivered elements in an arrangement 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is based on the price generally charged when the element is sold separately or  if not yet sold separately  is established by authorized management 
in situations where vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for an undelivered element does not exist  the entire amount of revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized when fair value can be established for all undelivered elements or when all such elements are delivered 
service revenue includes maintenance revenue  usage and subscription based revenue from our hosted services offerings  consulting and training services 
license revenue is deferred when the criteria noted above are not met for revenue recognition purposes  and recognized  as appropriate  when all criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
maintenance revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the maintenance term  typically one year 
advance payments for hosted services are deferred and revenue is recognized over the service period 
deferred consulting and training revenues are recognized as those services are performed 
generally  sales made through distributors  resellers  and original equipment manufacturers are recognized at the time these partners report that they have sold the software or  alternatively  when we drop ship the product to the end user  in each case after all revenue recognition criteria have been met 
sales made to international master distributors of web analytics products are recognized when sold to the master distributor once all revenue recognition criteria have been met 
additionally  we monitor master distributor inventory levels  accounts 
table of contents receivable aging  and the distributor credit history and current credit rating 
we also maintain an allowance for potential sales returns 
when licenses and services are sold together  license fees are recognized upon shipment  provided that the above criteria have been met  payment of the license fee is not dependent upon the performance of the services  and the services do not provide significant customization of the software and are not essential to the functionality of the software that was sold 
for arrangements that do not meet the above criteria  license and related service revenues are recognized upon completion of all contractual obligations 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant estimates made in the accompanying financial statements are allowance for uncollectible accounts we provide an allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable as part of our general and administrative expenses based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and an analysis of the remaining accounts receivable 
the allowance was reduced by  during fiscal due to improvement in the accounts receivable aging  which resulted in a decrease in general and administrative expenses 
the actual write offs for uncollectible accounts during fiscal were  and recoveries from previously written off amounts were  resulting in an ending balance of  at june  in the future  if our actual collections differ significantly from our estimates it may result in additional charges to or decreases in our general and administrative expenses 
allowance for sales returns we provide an allowance for sales returns based on historical trends in product returns 
revenue is recognized net of the provision for sales returns 
during fiscal  we increased our allowance for sales returns by million reducing revenues commensurately and recorded million in actual product returns  resulting in an ending balance of million at june  if actual future returns differ significantly from our estimates  it may result in a decrease or increase in future revenue 
other intangible assets we record intangible assets when we acquire companies 
the cost of the acquisition is allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired  including identifiable intangible assets  with the remaining amount being classified as goodwill 
certain identifiable intangible assets such as purchased technology and customer lists are amortized over time  while in process research and development is recorded as a charge on the date of acquisition and goodwill is capitalized  subject to periodic review for impairment 
accordingly  the allocation of the acquisition cost to identifiable intangible assets has a significant impact on our future operating results 
the allocation process requires extensive use of estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets 
should conditions be different than management s current assessment  material write downs of intangible assets may be required 
we recorded a charge of  during the fourth quarter of fiscal related to discontinuance of the vigilent user manager technology purchased as part of the pentasafe acquisition 
we periodically review the estimated remaining useful lives of our other intangible assets 
a reduction in the estimate of remaining useful life could result in accelerated amortization expense in future periods 
during fiscal  we reclassified amortization of purchased technology from operating expenses to cost of revenue for all periods presented 
as such  any future amortization or write downs of these assets would adversely affect our gross margin 
goodwill under current accounting guidelines adopted on july  we no longer amortize goodwill to expense  but rather periodically assess goodwill for impairment 
accordingly  goodwill recorded in business combinations may significantly impact our future operating results to the extent impaired  but the magnitude and timing of any such impairment is uncertain 
when we conduct our annual evaluation of goodwill or if 
table of contents impairment indicators are identified with respect to previously recorded goodwill  the fair value of goodwill is determined using valuation techniques that require significant management judgment 
should conditions be different than management s original assessment  significant write downs of goodwill may be required 
upon adoption of sfas no 
in july  we ceased amortization of approximately million of goodwill 
we also recorded a one time  non cash transitional impairment charge of million because we determined that the carrying value of existing goodwill on july  exceeded its fair value by that amount 
we conducted our first annual review for impairment of goodwill as of april  and recorded a non cash charge of million 
the impairment charge is attributable to our revised forecast for operating profits and cash flows and corresponds to the overall decline in our market capitalization 
at june   the carrying value of our goodwill was approximately million 
if we are required to write down this goodwill in the future  our operating results will be adversely affected 
facility reserve we have various office spaces under lease  some of which have been vacated as of june  we accrue charges to our operating expenses when we decide to vacate facilities based on management s assessment of market conditions  the time required to sublease  experience with subleasing  and remaining lease term 
at june  we had one facility in portland  oregon that was fully reserved 
at june  our facility reserve was approximately  in july  we finalized a sub lease agreement with a tenant to occupy that space starting september if actual future rental payments  net of any sub lease income  differ significantly from our estimates  it may result in an increase or decrease in our operating expenses  and any increase could adversely affect future operating results 
restructuring liability in certain of our acquisitions we have resized our business and accrued restructuring liability associated with costs of employee terminations  vacating facilities and write off of assets that will no longer be used in operations  based on management estimates 
we recorded a restructuring charge of million in december associated with our acquisition of pentasafe 
of the total remaining liability of million at june   million relates to vacated facilities and  to severance for termination of employment 
in july we finalized a sub lease agreement with a tenant and  as a result  a portion of the vacated premises now have been sub leased and we expect to reduce our restructuring liability in the first quarter of fiscal by approximately  we also recorded a restructuring charge of  related to our acquisition of webtrends during fiscal there is no remaining liability outstanding related to this restructuring as of june  if the actual future payments  net of any sub lease income  differ significantly from our estimates  it may result in an increase or decrease in our restructuring charge  and any increase could adversely affect future operating results 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes includes taxes currently payable and changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
if we do not generate sufficient taxable income  the realization of these deferred tax assets may be impaired resulting in additional income tax expense 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce net deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be recognized 
substantially all of the valuation allowance is attributable to the tax benefit of disqualifying dispositions of stock options and will be credited to equity when realized 
the valuation allowance has been established to fully reserve these deferred tax assets due to uncertainty regarding their realizability 

table of contents results of operations on december  we completed the acquisition of marshal software  inc on december  we completed the acquisition of pentasafe security technologies  inc on march  we completed the acquisition of webtrends corporation 
results of these operations from the date of acquisition forward have been included in the consolidated financial statements 
total revenue 
total revenue and year over year changes are as follows in thousands  except percentages percentage change to to software license revenue software license revenue under microsoft agreement total software license revenue service revenue total revenue total revenue increased by million and million  or and  from fiscal to and from fiscal to  respectively 
software license revenue represented  and of total revenue for  and  respectively  with service revenue representing the balance of revenue for the same periods 
we expect our service revenue to grow as a percentage of total revenue as the license revenue from the microsoft agreement ceases  our installed base increases and existing customers renew maintenance contracts 
software license revenue 
total software license revenue decreased by from fiscal to  primarily due to a million decrease in revenue under microsoft agreement during fiscal this decrease was partially offset by inclusion of license revenue from our acquisitions of pentasafe and marshal and growth in our non microsoft revenue for a total increase of million  or during the same period 
total software license revenue increased by from fiscal to  primarily due to a million increase in revenue under the microsoft agreement during fiscal and the inclusion of the operations of webtrends for all of fiscal pursuant to the schedule of payments set forth in the agreement with microsoft  software license revenue from microsoft began a sequential decline in the quarter ended december  the final million under the agreement will be received during the first quarter of fiscal service revenue 
service revenue increased by million and million  or and  from fiscal to and from fiscal to  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to additional maintenance fees associated with new software licenses  renewals by our existing customers  and the inclusion of the operations of pentasafe and marshal partially during fiscal and webtrends for all of fiscal and service revenue increased in absolute terms due to the compounding effect of our base of installed licenses  a significant majority of our customers renewing their maintenance service agreements and inclusion of a greater amount of implementation service  and increases in revenue from our hosted web analytics service 
we expect our service revenue to grow as a percentage of total revenue as the license revenue from microsoft ceases in august  our installed base increases  and existing customers renew maintenance contracts 

table of contents total cost of revenue 
total cost of revenue and year over year changes are as follows in thousands  except percentages cost of software license revenue as percentage of license revenue cost of service revenue as percentage of service revenue amortization of purchased technology impairment of purchased technology total cost of revenue as percentage of total revenue total cost of revenue increased by million and million  or and  from fiscal to and from fiscal to  respectively 
cost of software license revenue 
our cost of software license revenue includes personnel costs and costs associated with software packaging  documentation such as user manuals and cds  and production  as well as non employee commissions and royalties 
cost of software license revenue as a percentage of related license revenue increased from during fiscal and to during fiscal the increase primarily is due to increases in royalty expense  fulfillment costs  and the decline in revenue from microsoft  which does not have any costs associated with it 
we expect cost of software license revenue to increase as a percentage of software license revenue in the future as the revenue from the microsoft agreement ceases 
cost of service revenue 
cost of service revenue consists primarily of personnel costs and expenses incurred in providing telephonic support  on site consulting services and training services 
costs associated with training consist principally of labor and travel expenses as well as training materials 
cost of service revenue as a percentage of related service revenue increased from during fiscal to during fiscal  and decreased to during fiscal the improvement in our services gross margin in fiscal is primarily attributable to a majority of our customers renewing their maintenance agreements and greater efficiencies in providing technical support services 
the decline in service gross margins in fiscal was primarily due to the addition of the webtrends customer base  which requires more implementation services than our traditional customers and includes higher cost operations relating to the subscription revenue from our hosted web analytics service 
we expect service revenue to increase in absolute dollars as our installed license base grows and  as a consequence  our cost of service revenue to increase in absolute dollars 
amortization and impairment of purchased technology 
purchased technology consists of developed software capitalized in our acquisitions and is amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful life  generally three years 
during fiscal  we revised the classification of amortization of purchased technology from operating expenses to cost of revenue 
the revision in expense classification was applied to all periods presented 
amortization increased from million during fiscal to million during fiscal and million during fiscal the increase in the amortization was due to additional amounts capitalized in acquisitions 
additionally  we recorded a charge of  during the fourth quarter of fiscal related to discontinuance of the vigilent user manager technology purchased as part of the pentasafe acquisition 
we expect to amortize approximately million of purchased technology during fiscal  absent further acquisitions or impairments 

table of contents operating expenses sales and marketing 
our sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs  including salaries and employee commissions  and expenses relating to travel  advertising  public relations  seminars  marketing programs  trade shows  lead generation activities and proportionately allocated facilities and information technology costs 
sales and marketing expenses and year over year changes are as follows in thousands  except percentages and headcount sales and marketing expenses percentage increase from previous year as a percentage of total revenue headcount at june sales and marketing expenses increased by million and million  or and  from fiscal to and from fiscal to  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars resulted principally from our acquisitions of pentasafe and marshal during fiscal  and from hiring additional field sales and support  inside sales and marketing personnel  expanding our sales infrastructure  increasing the number of third party channel partners  and higher sales commissions 
sales and marketing as a percentage of revenue decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal  and increased to in fiscal the fluctuation in the percentages was principally the result of the level of revenue from microsoft in each fiscal year  which does not require significant sales or marketing effort 
during fiscal  we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars  as a result of increase in non microsoft revenue and full year of operations for our fiscal acquisitions  partially offset by our workforce reductions 
research and development 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related costs  consulting fees  depreciation and proportionately allocated facilities and information technology costs 
to date  all research and development costs have been expensed as incurred in accordance with sfas no 
 as our software development process is essentially completed concurrent with the establishment of technological feasibility 
research and development expenses and year over year changes are as follows in thousands  except percentages and headcount research and development percentage increase from previous year as a percentage of total revenue headcount at june research and development expenses increased by million and million  or and  from fiscal to and from fiscal to  respectively 
this increase in absolute dollars resulted principally from increases in headcount  including personnel from our acquisitions of pentasafe and marshal 
our strategy since signing the license agreement with microsoft in september has been to increase spending in research and development through fiscal as a result  we brought to market a number of new products 
during fiscal  we expect research and development expenses to increase in absolute dollars  as a result of full year of operations for our fiscal acquisitions  partially offset by our workforce reductions 

table of contents general and administrative 
our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for finance and administration  as well as directors and officers insurance  professional services expenses  such as legal and accounting fees  and proportionately allocated facilities and information technology costs 
general and administrative expense and year over year changes are as follows in thousands  except percentages and headcount general and administrative percentage increase from previous year as a percentage of total revenue headcount at june general and administrative expenses increased by million and million  or and  from fiscal to and from fiscal to  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increased staffing necessary to manage and support our growth 
in fiscal  we also incurred higher legal expenses  as well as higher premiums for directors and officers insurance 
in fiscal  general and administrative expenses included million associated with a warrant issued to an executive search firm in march for recruiting services in connection with recruiting our chief executive officer 
during fiscal  we expect our general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars due to an increase in our directors and officers insurance premiums and full year of operations for our fiscal acquisitions  partially offset by our workforce reductions 
employee stock based compensation 
deferred employee stock based compensation represents the intrinsic value of unvested options assumed in the acquisitions of pentasafe and webtrends and charges associated with the grant of options at less than fair market value prior to our initial public offering 
the deferred amount is being amortized over the vesting periods of the assumed and granted options  generally four years 
during fiscal  and  we recognized employee stock based compensation expense of  million and million  respectively 
the increase in expense in fiscal  and the decrease in fiscal is due to the amortization of deferred employee stock based compensation related to the assumption of webtrends options  which has decreased over time in accordance with the vesting periods 
during fiscal  we expect to amortize approximately  of deferred employee stock based compensation 
amortization of other intangible assets 
amortization of other intangible assets includes amortization of customer contracts  customer lists  patents and tradename intangibles capitalized in our acquisitions  but excludes amortization of purchased technology 
amortization of purchased technology is classified as cost of revenue in accordance with sfas no 
 computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed 
other intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful life  generally three years 
amortization increased from million during fiscal to million during fiscal and decreased to million during fiscal the increase in the amortization during fiscal was due to additional amounts capitalized from acquisitions we completed in the decrease in the amortization during fiscal resulted from the full amortization of amounts capitalized in previous acquisitions  partially offset by intangibles assets capitalized from our acquisitions in december during fiscal  we expect to amortize approximately million of other intangible assets  absent further acquisitions 
impairment and amortization of goodwill 
during fiscal and we amortized million and million of goodwill recognized in our acquisitions 
we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on july  and accordingly stopped amortizing goodwill on that date 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 we recorded a one time  non cash transitional impairment charge of million to reduce the carrying value of our goodwill from previous acquisitions 
the charge is non operational in nature and is reflected as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
there was no income tax effect of the change in accounting principle 

table of contents we conducted our first annual review for impairment of goodwill as of april  and recorded a non cash charge of million 
the impairment charge is attributable to our revised forecast for operating profits and cash flows and corresponds to the overall decline in our market capitalization 
in calculating both impairment charges as of july  and april  the fair values of the reporting units were estimated using a combination of the discounted cash flows and comparable transactions methodologies 
under sfas no 
we are required to perform an annual test of impairment of goodwill 
we have determined to perform this test as of april each year 
in addition to the annual test of impairment of goodwill we assess impairment of goodwill between annual tests  at each balance sheet date  if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount  which can result in additional non cash charges 
write off of acquired in process research and development costs 
during fiscal and we expensed million and million  respectively  related to the acquisitions of pentasafe and webtrends  respectively 
these costs associated with the purchase of in process technology were charged to operations as the technologies had not reached technological feasibility and did not have alternative future uses at the date of acquisition 
no such charges were recorded during fiscal in connection with our acquisitions of pentasafe in december and webtrends in march we acquired technology consisting of both existing technology and in process research and development 
the valuation of acquired technology was made by applying the income approach  which considers the present value of the projected free cash flows that will be generated by the products  incorporating the acquired technologies under development  assuming they will be successfully completed 
projected free cash flows used in the income approach are based on pentasafe and webtrends past experience with typical product life cycles  and expected demand from pentasafe and webtrends customers  respectively  for new products 
a discount rate of was used to take into account the novelty of the technology  the extent of the company s familiarity with the technology  the stage of completion and the risks surrounding the successful development and commercialization of each of the in process research and development projects that were valued 
the key elements of the acquired companies development processes include design of user interface  developing code  integration with existing products  technical documentation  and testing 
a project is considered technologically feasible when a prototype is available for beta or general release 
these estimates are subject to change  given the uncertainties of the development process  and no assurance can be given that deviations from these estimates will not occur 
costs incurred prior to establishment of technological feasibility are charged to research and development expense and have not been material through june  such research and development costs to bring the remaining products from pentasafe to technological feasibility in fiscal are not expected to have a material impact on our future results of operations or financial condition 
restructuring charge 
during fiscal  we recorded a restructuring charge of million related to a plan to terminate employment of employees and vacate certain of our facilities that will no longer be used due to resizing the combined business after the acquisition of pentasafe 
during fiscal  we recorded a restructuring charge of  related to our plan to terminate employment of employees due to resizing the combined business after the acquisition of webtrends 
no such charge was recorded during fiscal total other income  net 
for fiscal  and  total other income  net was million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in total other income is primarily the result of lower interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  due to the continuing decline in the yield on new investments as earlier investments mature  as well as lower cash balances due to the use of cash in december for the acquisitions of pentasafe and marshal 
in addition  total other income includes in fiscal a charge of million related to an impairment of a long term investment in an affiliate 
table of contents based on management s assessment that the decline in value was other than temporary 
during fiscal  we expect interest income to decline due to lower cash and cash equivalents and short term investments and continued decline in yields 
income taxes 
we recorded income tax expense of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in the income tax expense incorporates a decrease in our effective tax rate from during fiscal and to during fiscal  in addition to a decrease in taxable income 
the tax benefit associated with dispositions from employee stock plans reduced federal and certain state income taxes payable to zero in fiscal  and recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses accounting for restructuring and similar costs 
sfas no 
supersedes previous accounting guidance  principally emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity 
we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
for restructuring activities after december  sfas no 
requires that the liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred  while under eitf issue no 
 a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of the company s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas no 
also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value 
accordingly  sfas no 
may affect the timing of recognizing future restructuring costs as well as the amounts recognized 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires additional disclosure for guarantees  including loan guarantees such as standby letters of credit 
it also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee  the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value  or market value  of the obligations it assumes under the guarantee and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements 
the provisions related to recognizing a liability at inception of the guarantee for the fair value of the guarantor s obligations do not apply to product warranties or to guarantees accounted for as derivatives 
we adopted fin effective january  adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the transition guidance and annual disclosure provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years ending after december  we adopted the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
effective january  liquidity and capital resources as of june  we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term investments  for a total of million compared to million as of june  a decrease of million 
the primary reason for the decline during fiscal was the use of approximately million in our acquisitions of pentasafe and marshal in december  offset partially by million in cash flows from operations 
our operating activities resulted in net cash inflows of million  million and million  in fiscal  and  respectively 
sources of cash during these periods were primarily from net income 
table of contents after adjusting for non cash charges

during fiscal and  the primary non cash charge was depreciation and amortization of million and million  principally from the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets 
in addition  increases in assets and decreases in liabilities  net of acquired assets and liabilities  used cash during fiscal during fiscal and decreases in assets and increases in liabilities provided cash

warrant not approved by stockholders 
in march we issued a warrant to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share to an executive search firm in connection with the search for the our new chief executive officer 
the warrant was immediately vested and exercisable 
the warrant was valued at million using the black scholes pricing model with the following assumptions contractual life of months  risk free interest rate of  volatility of  and no dividends paid during the contractual term 
the fair value of the warrant was expensed in march and is included in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss 
no shares have been issued pursuant to the warrant 
the warrant expired unexercised on july  factors that may affect future operating results the following risk factors and other information included in this report should be carefully considered 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem less significant also may impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate for a number of reasons  some of which are beyond our control 
these fluctuations may result in volatility in our stock price 
our quarterly operating results have varied substantially from quarter to quarter in the past and likely will vary significantly in the future due to revenue fluctuations caused by many factors 
those factors include general economic conditions and the discretionary nature of our customers purchasing practices  it budgets and budget cycles  the timing of new product introductions or enhancements by us  our competitors and our platform vendors  which may result in purchase deferrals by our customers in anticipation of new products  
table of contents competitive conditions in our industry  including new products  product announcements and special pricing offered by our competitors  our ability to introduce new products and enhancements and the timing of their release  our ability to offset the expiration of license fees from microsoft with growth in other areas of our business  our ability to complete specific sales transactions in a given quarter or fiscal year  the nature of the fees we charge to our customers one time perpetual license fees versus periodic subscription or service fees  and unexpected expenses relating to past or future acquisitions and managing our growth 
we have experienced seasonality in our license bookings  with the second and fourth quarter of our fiscal year typically having the largest volume in new license bookings 
we believe that this seasonality results from the budgeting  procurement and work cycles of our customers  from the structure of our direct sales incentive and compensation program and from industry accepted practices 
we expect this seasonality to continue in the future 
in addition  the risk of quarterly fluctuations relative to our expectations is increased by the fact that a significant portion of our revenues  typically between and  has historically been generated during the last month of each fiscal quarter  with a substantial portion of that occurring in the last week and last day of the fiscal quarter 
many customers tend to make a majority of their purchases at the end of a fiscal quarter and many enterprise customers negotiate licenses near the end of the quarter 
in part  this is because these customers believe that they are able to negotiate lower prices and more favorable terms at that time 
our reliance on a large portion of revenue occurring at the end of the quarter and the increase in the dollar value of transactions that occur at the end of a quarter can result in increased uncertainty relating to quarterly revenues 
due to this end of period buying pattern  forecasts may not be achieved  either because expected sales do not occur or because they occur at lower prices or on terms that are less favorable to us 
these factors increase the chances that our results could diverge from the expectations of investors and securities analysts 
while we have traditionally focused on sales of our products to workgroups and divisions of a customer  we are increasingly pursuing enterprise sales  resulting in a sales cycle ranging between and days  and in some cases longer 
in addition  in recent quarters we have experienced longer financial and purchasing review cycles from many of our customers  which we believe to be a result of the current economic conditions 
we base our operating expenses on our expectations regarding future revenue 
because our operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term  even a relatively small revenue shortfall can materially impact our short term profitability 
given the above factors  we believe that quarter to quarter financial comparisons may not necessarily be meaningful  and should not be relied upon as single indicators of our future operating results and performance 
if our quarterly operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts or investors  the trading price of our common stock could be negatively affected 
the market price of our common stock has been volatile and we expect that our stock price will continue to fluctuate 
the value of an investment in our stock could decline due to the impact of a number of factors upon the market price of our common stock  including growth rate expectations for the technology sector generally  variations in our actual and anticipated operating results and revenues  changes in our earnings estimates by securities analysts  and our failure to meet securities analysts performance expectations 
we base a substantial portion of our marketing  sales strategy  and product development on our relationship with microsoft 
in september  we licensed a substantial portion of our operations manager technology to microsoft for million  payable over a three year period ending august microsoft may use the technology broadly with respect to windows  but its use is limited with respect to windows nt 
microsoft used that 
table of contents technology as the basis for its microsoft operations manager or mom product 
we also agreed to provide limited engineering resources for a fee and to develop and market new products  or extended management packs xmps  that operate with mom 
we received significant benefits from the agreement  but it also poses significant risks and challenges  including license revenue from the agreement was million during fiscal  million during fiscal  million during fiscal  and will be million in the first quarter of fiscal because the payments under the agreement ceased in august  we must generate significant incremental revenue from other sources to maintain overall revenue growth  and revenue from sales of appmanager products may decline due to customer concern regarding potential overlap between mom and appmanager 
the order rates for appmanager and xmp products have fluctuated in recent quarters 
more widespread adoption of mom may lead to the loss of revenue from our appmanager products 
although such adoption may increase our opportunity to earn additional revenue from licenses of xmps  such additional revenue may not be sufficient to offset the loss of revenue from our appmanager products 
we believe that our success in penetrating target markets for our systems management products depends in part on our ability to maintain a strong strategic relationship with microsoft  even after the revenue stream and marketing collaboration under our license agreement with microsoft ends 
our relationship with microsoft is important to validate our technology  facilitate broad market acceptance of our products  and enhance our sales  marketing  and distribution capabilities 
on the other hand  microsoft provides various products and management features  such as mom  that include competitive and overlapping capabilities to some of the solutions we offer on the microsoft platform  and may expand its presence in this and other markets in the future 
we participate with microsoft in a number of joint sales and marketing initiatives 
it is possible that microsoft may decline to participate in joint initiatives in the future 
we also attempt to coordinate our systems management product offerings with future releases of microsoft s operating systems and software 
it is possible that in the future microsoft may not notify us of feature enhancements to its products prior to new releases of its operating systems or may not provide us with necessary development tools and information or may choose to work more closely with our competitors 
in that case  we may not be able to introduce products on a timely basis that capitalize on new microsoft operating system releases and feature enhancements 
we may not be able to achieve or sustain the revenue growth rates we have previously experienced 
during the first three quarters of fiscal  our sequential quarterly revenue growth rates were approximately  attributable in substantial part to our agreement with microsoft 
during fiscal  the license revenue from microsoft decreased in accordance with the agreement 
as a consequence  we experienced for the first time sequential decreases in our quarterly license revenue starting in the quarter ended march  we have used the revenue resulting from our license with microsoft to fund increased development of new products that came to market in fiscal and and additional new products that we will introduce in fiscal revenue resulting from these new products  together with products acquired in our acquisitions  will require greater sales and marketing efforts resulting in higher operating expenses 
however  to achieve profitability we must increase revenue from non microsoft sources while reducing overall operating expenses 
we are increasing our reliance on indirect distribution channels as a means of growing product sales and are intensifying our emphasis on international sales made through those channels 
these relationships  both domestically and internationally  are non exclusive and typically are terminable upon short notice 
this strategy presents a number of risks and uncertainties including the ability of resellers or integrators to cease marketing or integrating our products with little or no notice  the ability of our resellers or integrators to market or use competitive products or services from third parties and to promote such third party products or services in preference to ours  the effectiveness of our resellers and integrators in marketing our products  the difficulty in 
table of contents attracting and replacing high quality resellers and integrators  the potential of conflicts between our direct and indirect sales channels resulting in lost sales and customer confusion or dissatisfaction  and risk associated with accurately reporting revenue 
to increase our revenue we also must continue to enhance our existing products and services and to develop new products  services and multiple product solutions to address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our existing and prospective customers 
the development of new products  services  solutions  and enhancement of existing products and services  entail significant technical and business risks and require substantial lead time and significant investments in product development 
the market for some of our products is in the early stage of development  and we are recent entrants to such markets and face competition from established competitors 
as is common in new and evolving industries  demand and market acceptance for recently introduced products and new market entrants are subject to high levels of uncertainty and risk 
furthermore  new products can quickly render obsolete products that were formerly in high demand  which may include products that currently provide us with significant revenue 
we have a history of losses and may experience losses in the future 
since our inception  we have incurred significant net losses 
during fiscal  and  we reported net losses of million  million and million  respectively  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these losses principally resulted from amortization and impairment of goodwill  amortization of other intangible assets and other acquisition related charges 
during fiscal and  we amortized million and million of goodwill recognized in our acquisitions 
we adopted sfas no 
on july   and accordingly ceased amortizing goodwill on that date 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 we recorded a one time  non cash charge of million to reduce the carrying value of our goodwill from previous acquisitions 
we conducted our first annual review for impairment of goodwill as of april  and recorded a non cash charge of million 
the impairment charge is attributable to our revised forecast for operating profits and cash flows and corresponds to the overall decline in our market capitalization 
if in future periods we determine that goodwill has become impaired  we will be required to record additional charges  which would negatively affect our operating results 
we recorded a charge of  during the fourth quarter of fiscal related to discontinuance of the vigilent user manager technology purchased as part of the pentasafe acquisition 
during fiscal  we also recorded an impairment charge of million on an investment in a non public company based on management s assessment that the decline in value of that investment was other than temporary 
if in the future we determine that such intangible assets and or investments have further declined in value  we may record additional charges  which would negatively affect our operating results 
we expect to experience a net loss in fiscal to the extent we have any unexpected expenses or do not achieve our revenue targets our results will be adversely affected  which may in turn adversely affect our stock price 
if recent and anticipated measures to re size and reorganize our business are not successful  we may experience distraction of management  disruptions to operations and unanticipated expenses 
in light of our recent acquisitions and changing business environment  we have adopted a number of measures to align our expenses with anticipated revenues and better prepare ourselves to exploit our target markets 
in december  as part of our acquisition of pentasafe we restructured our business  and terminated the employment of employees from netiq and employees from pentasafe 
as a result of these measures  we recorded a charge of approximately million related to the netiq restructuring  including both employee termination benefits and reserves for facilities that were vacated  and a charge of approximately million for termination benefits related to terminated employment of pentasafe employees 

table of contents in april  we announced a reduction in force designed to reduce operating costs by combining our systems and security business units and streamlining our organizational structure 
as a result  we terminated the employment of employees  including four senior executives  substantially all of whom left the company by june  in addition  on july   we re aligned our sales force from a territory orientation to a named account orientation to better focus on our existing customer base and realigned our products into solution sets 
the focus on specific customer needs and product solution sets  together with our recent implementation of a value based sales approach  is intended to enable us to meet customer needs more quickly and achieve more cost effective sales operations  but may result in disruption of sales activities 
to the extent we engage in these and other organizational changes in the future  we may incur additional costs and expenses and suffer lost revenue 
these measures  and any future steps we may adopt  may result in distraction of management  operational disruption or negative impact on customer service and satisfaction 
to the extent we are unsuccessful in implementing these changes  we may not realize the intended operational improvements and cost reductions  and our business and financial condition would be adversely affected 
we have recently experienced several changes in our senior management team 
in january  charles m 
boesenberg joined the company as president and chief executive officer  and on august  mr 
boesenberg was named chairman of the board of directors  in each instance replacing ching fa hwang  a co founder of netiq who remains a member of the board 
upon completion of the acquisition of pentasafe  douglas j 
erwin  formerly ceo of pentasafe  joined us as general manager  security business unit  and he was appointed to the board in january in april  as a result of the combination of our systems and security business units  and other efforts to streamline our business  we announced the departure of four members of our executive team 
richard j 
pleczko  senior vice president of worldwide marketing  douglas j 
erwin  general manager of the security business unit and william d 
vance  senior vice president of engineering for the security business unit  resigned their positions as officers of the company effective april   and glenn s 
winokur resigned as chief operating officer effective june  although mr 
erwin resigned his position as an officer  he remained a member of the board of directors until august   when he resigned due to other business commitments 
our success will depend to a significant extent on our ability to assimilate these changes in our leadership team and to retain the services of our executive officers and other key employees 
we do not have employment contracts for a defined term with our employees  including our executives and key employees 
if we lose the services of one or more of our executives or key employees  including if one or more of our executives or key employees decided to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us  this could harm our business and affect our ability to successfully implement our business objectives 
failure to manage our growth  improve our infrastructure  and satisfactorily implement new information and fulfillment systems may adversely affect our business 
we have grown rapidly  including through acquisitions 
our growth has resulted in new and increased responsibilities for our management personnel and the need to effectively manage multiple geographic locations  develop new products that utilize the assets and resources of the combined entities and further develop cost effective standards  controls  procedures and policies 
if we do not succeed in addressing these challenges or any other problems encountered in connection with our growth  our business  operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
our growth has resulted in a need to upgrade our operational  financial  and management information systems 
in particular  we have been required to improve our accounting and financial reporting systems in order to accommodate our growth on a global basis and to meet the requirements of a changing regulatory environment 
to meet these challenges we implemented a new customer relationship management system in fiscal  and are continuing the process of modifying and refining it to better meet our needs 
we also 
table of contents implemented a new enterprise resource planning system  including an accounting and financial bookkeeping system for tracking and reporting the company s financial information  during the december quarter and are in the process of modifying and refining it to better meet our needs 
most recently  we have implemented eservices technology that provides self service support capabilities to our customers 
while we believe that these systems will enable us to operate more efficiently and will enhance our ability to provide timely and accurate reporting  the failure  poor performance or errors of any of these systems  especially during the high volume end of quarter time periods  could impact our ability to sell and deliver our products which could in turn materially and adversely impact our business  including our ability to meet our revenue and expense targets 
changes in accounting regulations could negatively affect market perception of our results and the way we do business 
the accounting rules applicable to our business have undergone significant changes in recent years  and future changes in accounting regulations and related interpretations and policies  particularly those related to expensing of employee stock options  could cause us to account for our business in ways that may adversely affect our operating results 
as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  currently we apply accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations in accounting for our employee stock option plans 
under apb no 
 no compensation expense is recognized for options granted to employees where the exercise price equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
a change in accounting rules that would require us to change the way we account for such options to include a deferred compensation liability on our balance sheet and to include the deemed expense associated with such options in our statement of operations may  if adopted  reduce operating income or increase operating losses as a result of these non cash expenses 
in such an event  investor perception of our results of operations may be adversely affected and our stock price may fall 
changes in the way we do business may impact our operating results by changing the manner in which we are required to account for sales 
there have been various changes in the enterprise software business that may impact the manner in which we do business 
we currently sell most of our software licenses on a perpetual basis  which enables us to recognize the majority of revenue received in connection with the sale promptly upon consummation of the sale 
however  certain software vendors are moving towards a subscription based model in which periodic fees are charged for use of the software 
if customers increasingly demand that we sell licenses to our software on a subscription basis  or otherwise charge a periodic fee for its use  it will delay our recognition of revenue for that sale and will decrease the revenues attributable to such sales during the reporting period in which the sale is made although the revenue will continue to be recognized in subsequent periods 
if substantial portions of our license sales are converted to a subscription basis  this could materially impact our revenues during the initial quarters in which the change is implemented 
our international sales and operations subject us to additional risks that can adversely affect our operating results 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from customers outside the united states and are continuing to expand our international operations 
during fiscal  we have established operations in galway  ireland to provide customer support and shared administrative services for the europe middle east africa region 
with our december acquisition of marshal  we now have development  support  and administrative services operations in new zealand 
we also maintain offices in japan and the united kingdom  as well as a number of other foreign locations  to provide sales and sales support 
our international operations are subject to a variety of risks  including the overlap of different tax regimes  the difficulty of managing and staffing foreign offices  
table of contents differing regulatory and legal requirements and employment schemes  and our ability to identify and timely comply with such requirements and schemes  longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  fluctuations in currency exchange rates and difficulties in transferring funds from certain countries  the need to localize and internationalize our products and licensing programs  significant reliance on our distributors and other resellers who do not offer our products exclusively  import and export licensing requirements  including export controls on encryption technology  political and economic instability in some countries  seasonal reductions in business activity during the summer months in europe and certain other regions  and reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries 
to date  a substantial portion of our sales have been denominated in us dollars  and we have not used risk management techniques or hedged the risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
in the future  if we do not engage in hedging transactions  our results of operations will be subject to losses from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates to the extent our sales are denominated in foreign currencies 
acquisitions and investments present many risks  and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that were contemplated at the time of the transaction 
we have made investments in and acquired companies in the past  including our acquisitions of pentasafe and marshal in december we may in the future acquire or make investments in complementary companies  products  services and technologies 
the risks we may encounter in connection with an acquisition or investment include we may find that the acquired company or assets do not further our business strategy  or that we paid more than what the company or assets are later worth  or economic conditions change  all of which may generate a future impairment charge  we may have difficulty integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired business  and may have difficulty retaining the key personnel of the acquired business  we may have difficulty in incorporating the acquired technologies or products with our existing product lines  there may be customer confusion where our products overlap with those of the acquired company  we may have product liability associated with the sale of the acquired company s products  our ongoing business and management s attention may be disrupted or diverted by transition or integration issues and the complexity of managing geographically and culturally diverse locations  we may have difficulty maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies across locations  the acquisition may result in litigation from terminated employees  and we may experience significant problems or liabilities associated with product quality  technology and legal contingencies  among other matters 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition or cash flows  particularly in the case of a larger acquisition or multiple acquisitions 
from time to time  we may enter into negotiations for acquisitions or investments that are not ultimately consummated 
such negotiations could result in significant diversion of management time  as well as out of pocket costs 
in addition  should we fail to consummate an acquisition  we may be required to pay a break up fee which will be charged to our costs of operation and we may be exposed to litigation as a consequence of our failure to go forward with the proposed acquisition 

table of contents the consideration paid in connection with an investment or acquisition also impacts our operating results and financial condition 
for example  during the quarter ended december  we spent million in cash  net of cash received  issued million shares of our common stock and assumed employee stock options to purchase million shares of our common stock  for the acquisitions of pentasafe and marshal 
to the extent we pay cash for future acquisitions our cash reserves will be further reduced 
to the extent we issue shares of stock or other rights to purchase stock  including options and other rights  existing stockholders may be diluted and earnings per share may decrease 
in addition  acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt  large one time write offs such as of acquired in process research and development costs  restructuring charges  and goodwill and other intangible assets that are subject to impairment and can result in future impairment charges 
upon adoption of sfas no 
on july   we recorded a one time  non cash transitional impairment charge of million to reduce the carrying value of our goodwill from previous acquisitions 
we conducted our first annual review for impairment of goodwill as of april  and recorded a non cash charge of million 
if we are required to write down goodwill in the future  our operating results will be adversely affected 
during fiscal  we also recorded an impairment charge of million on an investment in a non public company based on management s assessment that the decline in value of that investment was other than temporary 
if in the future we determine that such investments have further declined in value  we may record additional charges  which would negatively affect our operating results 
we face competition from a number of existing competitors  as well as potential new competitors  which could result in loss of market share and diminished profits 
we currently face competition from a number of sources  including customers internal information technology departments that develop or integrate systems management  security management  or web analytics tools for their particular needs  application vendors who bundle management solutions with their products such as oracle corporation and sap ag  providers of network and systems management framework products such as computer associates international  inc  hewlett packard company  and international business machines corporation  providers of performance and availability management solutions such as bmc software  inc  concord communications  inc  and veritas software corporation  providers of content security solutions such as clearswift limited  tumbleweed communications corp  trend micro  inc  postini corporation  brightmail  inc  surfcontrol plc  and websense  inc  vendors of internet servers  operating systems or networking hardware  such as microsoft corporation  sun microsystems  inc  and others that bundle systems management solutions with their products  providers of administration products such as bindview corporation and quest software  inc  providers of security management solutions such as bindview corporation  computer associates international  inc  international business machines corporation  internet security systems  inc  network associates technology  inc  and symantec corporation  web management service providers and vendors  such as consulting firms  web design firms  internet audit firms  site management vendors  internet service providers and independent software vendors  providers of ebusiness intelligence solutions such as the netgenesis products from spss  inc  and providers of hosted web analytics solutions such as coremetrics  inc  omniture  inc  and websidestory  inc 
in the future potential competitors may bundle their products with products similar to ours  or incorporate functionality into existing products that renders certain of our products unmarketable or obsolete 
in addition  our 
table of contents ability to sell our products depends  in part  on the compatibility of our products with other third party products  such as operating systems and messaging  internet and database applications 
some of these third party software developers may change their products so that they compete with our products or are no longer compatible with our products 
any of the foregoing could lead to price reductions or a potential loss of sales of the affected products 
errors in our products could result in significant costs to us and could impair our ability to sell our products 
because our software products are complex  they may contain errors  or bugs  that could be detected at any point in a product s life cycle 
these errors could materially and adversely affect our business reputation  result in significant costs to us  and impair our ability to sell our products in the future 
the costs incurred in correcting any product errors may be substantial and could decrease our profit margins 
while we expect to continually test our products for errors and work with customers through our customer support services organization to identify and correct bugs  errors in our products may be found in the future 
because it is difficult to simulate the highly complex computing environments in which our customers use our products and because of the increasing functionality of our product offerings  testing may be complicated and fail to identify all errors 
moreover  because our products support and interoperate with third party operating systems and applications  any errors or bugs in that software may result in errors in the performance of our products and may require cooperation from the third party to resolve 
detection of any significant errors may result in  among other things  lost or delayed market acceptance and sales of our products  diversion of development resources  injury to our reputation  and increased service and warranty costs 
errors in our software also may result in expensive and time consuming litigation  and the potential award of substantial damages 
while our software license agreements typically contain limitations and disclaimers that purport to limit our liability for damages for errors in our software  there is no assurance that such limitations and disclaimers will be enforced by a court or other tribunal or will otherwise effectively protect us from such claims 
this is particularly true with respect to those of our products licensed under shrink wrap or clickwrap license agreements that are not signed by licensees  but also may apply to negotiated license agreements 
we presently carry errors and omissions insurance against such claims  but there is no assurance that such insurance coverage will be adequate to cover any losses as a result of bugs or errors or will be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms 
third parties could assert that our products infringe their intellectual property rights 
such claims could injure our reputation and adversely affect our ability to sell our products 
third parties may claim that our current or future products infringe their proprietary rights  and these claims  whether they have merit or not  could harm our business by increasing our costs or reducing our revenue 
for example in january  bmc software  inc bmc filed suit against us alleging that our appmanager product infringes a bmc patent  and that we are infringing a bmc trademark 
that litigation has now been stayed and the court has ordered that bmc submit its claims to arbitration 
although we believe these claims to be without merit  claims such as these could affect our relationships with existing customers and may discourage future customers from purchasing our products 
the intensely competitive nature of our industry and the importance of technology to our competitors businesses may enhance the likelihood of being subject to third party claims of this nature 
any such claims  even if without merit  could be time consuming  result in potentially significant litigation costs or damages  cause product shipment delays and require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
royalty or license agreements may not be available on commercially favorable terms or at all 
such claims could also force us either to stop selling  incorporating or using products or services that incorporate the challenged intellectual property or to redesign those products or services that incorporate such technology 
we expect that software developers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in the software industry grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 

table of contents if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights  competitors may be able to use our technology or trademarks and this could weaken our competitive position  reduce our revenue and increase costs 
our success is heavily dependent on proprietary technology 
we rely primarily on a combination of patent  copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property rights in our products and services 
these laws and procedures provide only limited protection 
we presently have issued patents in the united states  pending patent applications in the united states  issued foreign patent  and pending patent applications in certain foreign jurisdictions 
however  these patents may not provide sufficiently broad protection or they may not be enforceable in actions against alleged infringers 
as well  despite precautions that we take  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy or reverse engineer aspects of our current or future products or to independently develop similar or superior technology or design around the patents we own 
policing unauthorized use and transfer of our software is difficult and software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem 
in licensing our products  other than in enterprise license transactions  we typically rely on shrink wrap or clickwrap licenses that are not signed by licensees 
such licenses may be unenforceable  in whole or in part  under the laws of certain jurisdictions 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or trademarks to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
such litigation would be costly and potentially distracting to management  and there is no assurance that we will be successful in such litigation 
we incorporate software licensed from third parties into some of our products and any significant interruption in the availability of these third party software products or defects in these products could reduce the demand for  or prevent the sale or use of  our products 
certain of our software products contain components developed and maintained by third party software vendors or available through the open source software community 
we also expect that we may incorporate software from third party vendors and open source software in our future products 
our business would be disrupted if this software  or functional equivalents of this software  were either no longer available to us or no longer offered to us on commercially reasonable terms 
in either case  we would be required to either redesign our software to function with alternate third party software or open source software  or develop these components ourselves  which would result in increased costs and could result in delays in our software shipments 
furthermore  we might be forced to limit the features available in our current or future software offerings 
we presently are developing products for use on the linux platform 
the sco group sco has filed and threatened to file lawsuits against companies that operate linux for commercial purposes  alleging that such use of linux infringes sco s intellectual property rights 
the threat of such litigation and the cost of the licensing scheme presently proposed by sco may adversely affect the demand for the linux platform and  consequently  the sales of our linux based products 
natural disasters or other incidents may affect our network and data centers or otherwise disrupt our business 
we rely on our network and data center infrastructure for internal communications  communications with customers and partners  direct sales of our software products  sales lead generation and direct provision of fee based services 
that infrastructure  as well as our other facilities  is vulnerable to damage from human error  physical or electronic security breaches  power loss and other utility failures  fire  earthquake  flood  sabotage  vandalism and similar events 
despite precautions  a natural disaster or other incident could result in interruptions in our service or significant damage 
continued attempts to exploit security vulnerabilities in infrastructure products poses a real and serious threat to the stability of our it infrastructure 
recent virus and worms  like slammer in summer  have the ability to propagate across the global network quickly causing business disruption even for well prepared organizations 
we believe our processes for managing these risks are appropriate  however  there are currently no safeguards that will guarantee full protection 

table of contents in addition  failure of any of our telecommunications providers to provide consistent data communications capacity  including as a result of business failure  could result in interruptions in our services and disruption of our business operations 
any of the foregoing could impact our provision of services and fulfillment of product  and our ability to process product orders and invoices and otherwise timely conduct our business operations 
we have various mechanisms in place that may discourage takeover attempts 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain provisions of delaware law could delay or make difficult a change in control of the company that a stockholder may consider favorable 
our certificate of incorporation allows our board of directors to designate and issue one or more series of preferred stock that may have rights preferences and privileges superior to our common stock without any action by our stockholders 
we have a classified board of directors  with staggered  three year terms  that may lengthen the time required to gain control of the board of directors 
in addition  certain of our officers are parties to a change of control agreement or other agreements with the company  which provide for the acceleration of stock option vesting and the payment of certain compensation in the event such officer s employment is terminated within a specified period after a change of control 
in addition  our and stock plans provide for acceleration of stock option vesting in the event an employee s employment is terminated within a specified period after a change of control 
any of these provisions could dissuade a potential acquirer from seeking to acquire control of netiq  which in turn could result in our stockholders not being able to participate in premiums that may otherwise have been offered in potential acquisition 
compliance with certain regulatory requirements may prove difficult and costly and  should we be unsuccessful  may subject us to penalties 
we are subject to laws relating to the use and transfer of personally identifiable information about our customers  employees and other individuals  especially outside of the united states 
violation of these laws  which in many cases apply not only to third party transfers  but also to transfers of information between our subsidiaries and ourselves  and between and among ourselves  our subsidiaries and our commercial partners  could subject us to significant penalties and negative publicity 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio and have no foreign exchange contracts 
our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  trade accounts receivable  and accounts payable 
we consider investments in highly liquid debt instruments purchased with a remaining maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our short term investments  thus  fluctuations in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of these securities 
our investment policy limits the percentage of assets that can be invested in any one issuer of debt and any one type of short term investment 
our business is principally transacted in united states dollars 
during fiscal  of our invoices were in currencies other than the united states dollar 
accordingly  we are subject to exposure from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
this exposure is primarily related to local currency denominated revenue and operating expenses in australia  austria  belgium  brazil  canada  denmark  france  germany  ireland  italy  japan  netherlands  new zealand  norway  south africa  spain  sweden  switzerland  taiwan and the united kingdom 
we believe that a natural hedge exists in some local currencies  as local currency denominated revenue will substantially offset the local currency denominated operating expenses 
we assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposures on an ongoing basis 
however  as of june  we had no hedging contracts outstanding 
at june  we had million in cash and cash equivalents  and million in short term investments 
based on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at june   a hypothetical increase decrease in interest rates would increase decrease our annual interest income and cash flows by approximately
