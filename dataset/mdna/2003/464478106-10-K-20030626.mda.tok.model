item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading provider of software solutions and services to the retail industry 
we provide high value innovative solutions that help retailers understand  create  manage and fulfill consumer demand 
our solutions and services have been developed specifically to meet the needs of the retail industry 
our solutions help retailers improve the efficiency and effectiveness of their operations and build stronger  longer lasting relationships with their customers 
up until april   we also developed and distributed pc courseware and skills assessment products for both desktop and retail applications 
we developed our retail application software technology and services business through acquisitions 
the largest and most important of these acquisitions were o applied retail solutions  inc ars in july for aggregate consideration of million in cash and stock paid to the former stockholders  and o island pacific systems corporation in april for million cash 
island pacific is one of the leading providers of retail management solution 
ars was one of the leading providers of store applications  and the technology we acquired and have subsequently enhanced now forms the core of our store solutions 
we accounted for both the island pacific and ars acquisitions using purchase accounting  which has resulted in the addition of significant goodwill and capitalized software assets on our balance sheet 
we amortized capitalized software and goodwill from both of these acquisitions using ten year lives through march  see significant accounting policies below 
effective april   we restructured our operations into three strategic business units lead by experienced managers 
the business units are island pacific  svi store solutions and svi training products  inc effective april   we sold the svi training products  inc unit and discontinued the training product line of business 
our operations are conducted principally in the united states and the united kingdom 
prior to february  we also conducted business in australia 
we currently derive the majority of our revenues from the sale of application software licenses and the provision of related professional and support services 
application software license fees are dependent upon the sales volume of our customers  the number of users of the application s  and or the number of locations in which the customer plans to install and utilize the application s 
as the customer grows in sales volume  adds additional users and or adds additional locations  we charge additional license fees 
we typically charge for support  maintenance and software updates on an annual basis pursuant to renewable maintenance contracts 
we typically charge for professional services including consulting  implementation and project management services on an hourly basis 
our sales cycles for new license sales historically ranged from three to twelve months  but new license sales were limited during the past two fiscal years and sales cycles are now difficult to estimate 
our long sales cycles have in the past caused our revenues to fluctuate significantly from period to period 
the reduction of new license sales caused the revenues of our australian subsidiary to decrease substantially prior to discontinuation of operations in february  and our sales mix in the us and the uk to shift to lower margin services 
we manage long lived assets by geographic region 
the geographic distribution of our revenues and long lived assets for the fiscal years ended march   and is as follows in thousands year ended year ended year ended march  march  march  in thousands net sales continuing operations united states    united kingdom    discontinued operations united states    australia   united kingdom total net sales    long lived assets united states    australia discontinued operations  united kingdom total long lived assets    up to april   we classified our operations into two lines of business retail solutions and training products 
as revenues  results of operations and assets related to our training products subsidiary were below the threshold established for segment reporting  we consider our business for the fiscal year ended march  to have consisted of one reportable operating segment 
effective april   we sold our training products subsidiary and discontinued the training products line of business 
results of operations for fiscal reflect continued weakness in new license sales of our application software suites

critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  based on historical experience  and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements o revenue recognition 
our revenue recognition policy is significant because our revenue is a key component of our results of operations 
in addition  our revenue recognition determines the timing of certain expenses such as commissions and royalties 
we follow specific and detailed guidelines in measuring revenue  however  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue policy 
we license software under non cancelable agreements and provide related services  including consulting and customer support 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended and interpreted by statement of position  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  as well as technical practice aids issued from time to time by the american institute of certified public accountants 
software license revenue is generally recognized when a license agreement has been signed  the software product has been delivered  there are no uncertainties surrounding product acceptance  the fees are fixed and determinable  and collection is considered probable 
if a software license contains an undelivered element  the fair value of the undelivered element is deferred and the revenue recognized once the element is delivered 
in addition  if a software license contains customer acceptance criteria or a cancellation right  the software revenue is recognized upon the earlier of customer acceptance or the expiration of the acceptance period or cancellation right 
typically  payments for our software licenses are due in installments within twelve months from the date of delivery 
where software license agreements call for payment terms of twelve months or more from the date of delivery  revenue is recognized as payments become due and all other conditions for revenue recognition have been satisfied 
deferred revenue consists primarily of deferred license  prepaid services revenue and maintenance support revenue 
consulting services are separately priced  are generally available from a number of suppliers  and are not essential to the functionality of our software products 
consulting services  which include project management  system planning  design and implementation  customer configurations  and training are billed on both an hourly basis and under fixed price contracts 
consulting services revenue billed on an hourly basis is recognized as the work is performed 
on fixed price contracts  consulting services revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting by relating hours incurred to date to total estimated hours at completion 
we have from time to time provided software and consulting services under fixed price contracts that require the achievement of certain milestones 
the revenue under such arrangements is recognized as the milestones are achieved 
customer support services include post contract support and the rights to unspecified upgrades and enhancements 
maintenance revenues from ongoing customer support services are billed on a monthly basis and recorded as revenue in the applicable month  or on an annual basis with the revenue being deferred and recognized ratably over the maintenance period 
if an arrangement includes multiple elements  the fees are allocated to the various elements based upon vendor specific objective evidence of fair value 
o accounts receivable 
we typically extend credit to our customers 
software licenses are generally due in installments within twelve months from the date of delivery 
billings for customer support and consulting services performed on a time and material basis are due upon receipt 
from time to time software and consulting services are provided under fixed price contracts where the revenue and the payment of related receivable balances are due upon the achievement of certain milestones 
management estimates the probability of collection of the receivable balances and provides an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon an evaluation of our customers ability to pay and general economic conditions 
o valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
for fiscal  we have adopted sfas no 
resulting in a change in the way we value long term intangible assets and goodwill 
we were required to perform an initial transitional analysis of goodwill impairment 
we concluded this analysis as of april  and recorded an impairment of million as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the first quarter of fiscal we will no longer amortize goodwill  but will instead test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if certain events occur 
goodwill is to be measured for impairment by reporting units  which currently consist of our operating segments 
at each impairment test for a business unit  we are required to compare the carrying value of the business unit to the fair value of the business unit 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  goodwill will not be considered impaired 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  we will perform a second test comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the difference if any between the carrying amount of that goodwill and the implied fair value will be recognized as an impairment loss  and the carrying amount of the associated goodwill will be reduced to its implied fair value 
these tests require us to make estimates and assumptions concerning prices for similar assets and liabilities  if available  or estimates and assumptions for other appropriate valuation techniques 
for our intangible assets with finite lives  including our capitalized software and non compete agreements  we assess impairment at least annually or whenever events and circumstances suggest the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable based on the net future cash flows expected to be generated from the asset on an undiscounted basis 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles with finite lives may not be recoverable  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model

eitf no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
in general  this issue addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
specifically  this issue addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one earnings process and  if so  how to divide the arrangement into separate units of accounting consistent with the identified earnings processes for revenue recognition purposes 
this issue also addresses how arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting in the arrangement

many of those instruments were previously classified as equity 
sfas is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  we do not believe the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

the slow down in the us and world economy combined with the fear of future terrorist attacks and the ongoing hostilities in the world cause the retail industry to be more cautious with their investment in information systems and deliberately evaluating solutions  which resulted in decrease in sales and in extended sales cycles 
in addition  our financial condition may have interfered with our ability to sell new application software licenses  as implementation of our applications generally requires extensive future services and support  and some potential customers have expressed concern about our financial ability to provide these ongoing services 
we believe strongly that we provide and will continue to provide excellent support to our customers  as demonstrated by the continuing upgrade purchases by our top tier established customer base 
significant sales growth may however depend in part on our ability to improve our financial condition 
cost of sales gross profit cost of sales decreased million  or  to million in the fiscal year ended march  from million in the fiscal year ended march  gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in gross profit margin was due to a decrease in modification and professional services sales  which have low margin  combined with an increase in software license sales  which have much higher margin

these costs are neither capitalized nor included in application technology development expenses  but we consider them to be part of our overall application technology development program 
application development expense application development expense increased by million  or  to million in fiscal year ended march  from million in the fiscal year ended march  the increase in application development expense is primarily due to the ongoing enhancement of our suites of applications 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  to million compared to million in the fiscal year ended march  the decrease is due to decrease in sales and personnel reduction implemented in the third quarter of and fourth quarter of and control of expenditures 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization decreased by million  or  to million in the fiscal year ended march  from million in the fiscal year ended march  the decrease is mainly due a reduction of million in amortization pursuant to the non amortization provisions of statement financial accounting standard no 
sfas for goodwill with indefinite useful lives 
interest expense interest expense decreased by million  or  to million in the fiscal year ended march  from million in the fiscal year ended march  interest expense in fiscal included million interest expense on the million note payable to softline limited 
our obligations related to this note were released by softline effective in january  in connection with the integrated series of recapitalization transactions with softline 
the decrease was also due to million decrease in amortization of debt discount 
discontinued operations income from discontinued operations in fiscal represents a profit of million from operations of the training products subsidiary  offset in part by million accrual for loss on the sale of our training products subsidiary 
our training products subsidiary was sold effective april  extraordinary item gain on debt forgiveness on march   we entered into a discounted loan payoff agreement with union bank of california the bank  our senior lender 
under this agreement  we paid the bank million acquired from the sale of convertible debentures to certain investors 
we also issued to the bank million shares of our common stock and a  one year unsecured  non interest bearing convertible note payable in either cash or stock  at our option 
the cash payment  shares and convertible note were accepted by the bank in full satisfaction of our debt to the bank 
the bank also canceled the warrant to purchase million shares of our common stock and returned all collateral held  including million shares of our common stock pledged as security 
in connection with the settlement of the debt to the bank  we reported an extra ordinary gain of million

we believe our difficulties initially arose from insufficient staffing of our sales force 
although we significantly increased the staffing of our sales force in the first quarter of fiscal  the economic slowdown and the terrorist attacks of september   and the ongoing hostilities in the world increased the challenges faced by our sales force 
in addition  our financial condition may have interfered with our ability to sell new application software licenses  as implementation of our applications generally requires extensive future services and support  and some potential customers have expressed concern about our financial ability to provide these ongoing services 
cost of sales gross profit cost of sales was million in the fiscal years ended march  and gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in gross profit margin was due to a further shift in the sales mix from high margin application licenses to lower margin software modification and professional services

application development expense application development expense for the fiscal year ended march  was million as most development expenditures were client funded compared to million for the fiscal year ended march   a decrease of 
the decrease reflects a shift toward customer funded development expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  to million compared to million in the fiscal year ended march  the decrease was due to the following o personnel reduction implemented in the fourth quarter of and third quarter of and control of expenditures 
o a million reserve for bad debts in fiscal during the third quarter of  we completed an analysis of our operations and concluded that it was necessary to restructure the composition of our management and personnel 
we anticipated that the restructuring would result in an approximately million annual reduction in our expense levels compared to expenses prior to implementation of the plan 
to the extent resources are available  we expect to slowly increase our expense levels in fiscal from the reduced level after the reductions in the third quarter of fiscal additional planned expenditures are for the building of our sales force and for additions to our professional services group for us and uk retail operations as new licenses and services are sold 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization decreased by million  or  to million in the fiscal year ended march  from million in the fiscal year ended march  the decrease reflected the reduction in the base amounts of goodwill and capitalized software assets resulting from the recognition of impairments of those assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal interest income and expense interest expense was million in the fiscal years ended march  and interest income decreased million to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal due to cessation of the accrual of interest income on the note receivable received in connection with the sale of ibis after the second quarter of fiscal discontinued operations loss from discontinued operations in fiscal was million  which included million of net loss from australian operations and million of loss on disposal of the australian operations  offset in part by million of net income from the training products operations

accounts receivable increased during fiscal year primarily due to million increase in unbilled receivables 
the unbilled receivables represents license and services revenue fully earned at march  that will be billed subsequently in accordance with the contract terms 
accounts receivable decreased during fiscal year primarily due to a write off of  in receivables in connection with the discontinuation of australian operations in february and a significant improvement in collection efforts 
accounts receivable balances fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors including acquisitions and dispositions  seasonality  shifts in customer buying patterns  contractual payment terms  the underlying mix of applications and services sold  and geographic concentration of revenues

the facility was secured by substantially all of the assets of our australian subsidiary  and we have guaranteed all amounts owing on the facility 
in april  we received a formal demand under our guarantee for the full aus  approximately us  then alleged by the bank to be due under the facility 
due to the declining performance of our australian subsidiary  we decided in the third quarter of fiscal to sell certain assets of the australian subsidiary to the former management of such subsidiary  and then cease australian operations 
such sale was however subject to the approval of national australia bank  the subsidiary s secured lender 
the bank did not approve the sale and the subsidiary ceased operations in february the bank caused a receiver to be appointed in february to sell substantially all of the assets of the australian subsidiary and pursue collections on any outstanding receivables 
the receiver proceeded to sell substantially all of the assets for  in may to the entity affiliated with former management  and is actively pursuing the collection of receivables 
if the sale proceeds plus collections on receivables are insufficient to discharge the indebtedness to national australia bank  we may be called upon to pay the deficiency under our guarantee to the bank 
we have accrued  as the maximum amount of our potential exposure 
the receiver has also claimed that we are obligated to it for inter company balances of  but we do not believe any amounts are owed to the receiver  who has not as of the date of this report acknowledged the monthly corporate overhead recovery fees and other amounts charged by us to the australian subsidiary offsetting the amount claimed to be due 
other indebtedness  including related parties we issued convertible notes to entities related to icm asset management  inc  which notes were amended in july see financing transactions icm asset management  inc above

cash position as a result of our indebtedness and net losses for the past three years  we have experienced significant strains on our cash resources 
in order to manage our cash resources  we reduced expenses and discontinued our australian operations 
we have also extended payment terms with many of our trade creditors wherever possible  and we have diligently focused our collection efforts on our accounts receivable 
we had a negative working capital of million and million at march  and  respectively 
we were unable to make timely  monthly rent payments due for our irvine and carlsbad facilities during fiscal we renegotiated rent terms with the landlords of our irvine and carlsbad facilities  and we are currently in compliance with the renegotiated terms 
we have been actively engaged in attempts to resolve our liquidity problems 
we believe we will have sufficient cash to remain in compliance with our debt obligations  and meet our critical operating obligations  for the next twelve months 
we are nonetheless actively seeking a private equity placement to help discharge aged payables  pursue growth initiatives and prepay bank indebtedness 
we have no binding commitments for funding at this time

business risks investors should carefully consider the following risk factors and all other information contained in this form k 
investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
in addition to those described below  risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks occur  our business could be harmed  the price of our common stock could decline and our investors may lose all or part of their investment 
see the note regarding forward looking statements included at the beginning of this form k 
we incurred losses for the fiscal years   and we incurred losses of million  million  million and million in the fiscal years ended march    and  respectively 
the losses in the past three years have generally been due to difficulties completing sales for new application software licenses  the resulting change in sales mix toward lower margin services  and debt service expenses 
we will need to generate additional revenue to achieve profitability in future periods 
failure to achieve profitability  or maintain profitability if achieved  may have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price 
we have negative working capital  and we have extended payment terms with a number of our suppliers 
at march     we had negative working capital of million  million and million  respectively 
we have had difficulty meeting operating expenses  including interest payments on debt  lease payments and supplier obligations 
we have at times deferred payroll for our executive offices  and borrowed from related parties to meet payroll obligations 
we have extended payment terms with our trade creditors wherever possible 
as a result of extended payment arrangements with suppliers  we may be unable to secure products and services necessary to continue operations at current levels from these suppliers 
in that event  we will have to obtain these products and services from other parties  which could result in adverse consequences to our business  operations and financial condition 
our net sales have declined 
we experienced a substantial decrease in application software license sales 
our growth and profitability is dependent on the sale of higher margin licenses 
our net sales decreased by in the fiscal year ended march   compared to the fiscal year ended march  our net sales decreased by in the fiscal year ended march  compared to the fiscal year ended march  net sales for the fiscal year ended march  decreased compared to the fiscal year ended march  we experienced a substantial decrease in application license software sales  which typically carry a much higher margin than other revenue sources 
we must improve new application license sales to become profitable 
we have taken steps to refocus our sales strategy on core historic competencies  but our typically long sales cycles make it difficult to evaluate whether and when sales will improve 
we cannot be sure that the decline in sales has not been due to factors  which might continue to negatively affect sales 
our financial condition may interfere with our ability to sell new application software licenses 
future sales growth may depend on our ability to improve our financial condition 
our current financial condition has made it more difficult for us to complete sales of new application software licenses 
because our applications typically require lengthy implementation and extended servicing arrangements  potential customers require assurance that these services will be available for the expected life of the application 
these potential customers may defer buying decisions until our financial condition improves  or may choose the products of our competitors whose financial condition is or is perceived to be stronger 
customer deferrals or lost sales will adversely affect our business  financial conditions and results of operations 
our sales cycles are long and prospects are uncertain 
this makes it difficult for us to predict revenues and budget expenses 
the length of sales cycles in our business makes it difficult to evaluate the effectiveness of our sales strategies 
our sales cycles historically has ranged from three to twelve months  which has caused significant fluctuations in revenues from period to period 
due to our difficulties in completing new application software sales in recent periods and our refocused sales strategy  it is difficult to predict revenues and properly budget expenses 
our software applications are complex and perform or directly affect mission critical functions across many different functional and geographic areas of the retail enterprise 
in many cases  our customers must change established business practices when they install our software 
our sales staff must dedicate significant time consulting with a potential customer concerning the substantial technical and business concerns associated with implementing our products 
the purchase of our products is often discretionary  so lengthy sales efforts may not result in a sale 
moreover  it is difficult to predict when a license sale will occur 
all of these factors can adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past  and they may continue to do so in the future  which could adversely affect our stock price 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may fluctuate in the future as a result of several factors  many of which are outside of our control 
if revenue declines in a quarter  our operating results will be adversely affected because many of our expenses are relatively fixed 
in particular  sales and marketing  application development and general and administrative expenses do not change significantly with variations in revenue in a quarter 
it is likely that in some future quarter our net sales or operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
if that happens  our stock price will likely decline 
our revenue may vary from period to period  which makes it difficult to predict future results 
factors outside our control that could cause our revenue to fluctuate significantly from period to period include o the size and timing of individual orders  particularly with respect to our larger customers  o general health of the retail industry and the overall economy  o technological changes in platforms supporting our software products  and o market acceptance of new applications and related services 
in particular  we usually deliver our software applications when contracts are signed  so order backlog at the beginning of any quarter may represent only a portion of that quarter s expected revenues 
as a result  application license revenues in any quarter are substantially dependent on orders booked and delivered in that quarter  and this makes it difficult for us to accurately predict revenues 
we have experienced  and we expect to continue to experience  quarters or periods where individual application license or services orders are significantly larger than our typical application license or service orders 
because of the nature of our offerings  we may get one or more large orders in one quarter from a customer and then no orders the next quarter 
our expenses may vary from period to period  which could affect quarterly results and our stock price 
if we incur additional expenses in a quarter in which we do not experience increased revenue  our results of operations would be adversely affected and we may incur losses for that quarter 
factors that could cause our expenses to fluctuate from period to period include o the extent of marketing and sales efforts necessary to promote and sell our applications and services  o the timing and extent of our development efforts  and o the timing of personnel hiring 
it is difficult to evaluate our performance based on period to period comparisons of our results 
the many factors  which can cause revenues and expenses to vary  make meaningful period to period comparisons of our results difficult 
we do not believe period to period comparisons of our financial performance are necessarily meaningful  and you cannot rely on them as an indication of our future performance 
we may experience seasonal declines in sales  which could cause our operating results to fall short of expectations in some quarters 
we may experience slower sales of our applications and services from october through december of each year as a result of retailers focus on the holiday retail shopping season 
this can negatively affect revenues in our third fiscal quarter and in other quarters  depending on our sales cycles 
our debt could adversely affect us 
as of may   our debt is as follows o million in convertible debentures issued on march  to midsummer investment  ltd  omicron master trust  and islandia  lp due in full in may  with monthly redemptions to commence in february o  in convertible debentures issued on april  to mbsj investors llc due in full in october  with monthly redemptions to commence in february o  in convertible debentures issued on may  to crestview capital fund i  lp  crestview capital fund ii  lp  and crestview capital offshore fund  inc  with monthly redemptions to commence in february o million in convertible notes reissued in july to entities related to icm asset management  inc due september  o  in a convertible note issued to union bank of california na on march   due march  the substantial amount of our indebtedness impacts us in a number of ways o we have to dedicate a portion of cash flow from operations to principal and interest payments on the debt  which reduces funds available for other purposes 
o we may not have sufficient funds to pay principal and or interest payment when they become due  which could lead to a default 
these are just some factors pertaining to our debt that generally place us at a disadvantage to our less leveraged competitors 
any or all of these factors could cause our stock price to decline 
we have relied on capital contributed by related parties  and such capital may not be available in the future 
our cash from operations has not been sufficient to meet our operational needs  and we have relied on capital from related parties 
a company affiliated with donald s 
radcliffe  one of our directors  made short term loans to us in fiscal and in fiscal to meet payroll when cash on hand was not sufficient 
softline loaned us million to make a required principal payment on our union bank term loan in july a subsidiary of softline loaned us an additional  in november to meet working capital needs 
this loan was repaid in february  in part with  we borrowed from barry m 
schechter  our chairman 
we borrowed an additional  from mr 
schechter in march for operational needs related to our australian subsidiary  which was repaid in july we may not be able to obtain capital from related parties in the future 
neither softline  mr 
schechter  mr 
radcliffe nor any other officers  directors  stockholders or related parties are under any obligation to continue to provide cash to meet our future liquidity needs 
we may need to raise capital to repay debt and grow our business 
obtaining this capital could impair the value of your investment 
we may need to raise capital to discharge our aged payables and grow our business 
we will also likely need to raise capital to pay our million convertible note obligations to the entities related to icm asset management  inc due in full in september  our million and  convertible debenture obligations due in full in may  with monthly redemptions commencing in february  and our  convertible debenture obligations due in full in october  with monthly redemptions commencing in february we may also need to raise further capital to o support unanticipated capital requirements  o take advantage of acquisition or expansion opportunities  o continue our current development efforts  o develop new applications or services  or o address working capital needs 
our future capital requirements depend on many factors including our application development  sales and marketing activities 
we do not know whether additional financing will be available when needed  or available on terms acceptable to us 
if we cannot raise needed funds for the above purposes on acceptable terms  we may be forced to curtail some or all of the above activities and we may not be able to grow our business or respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated developments 
we may raise capital through public or private equity offerings or debt financings 
to the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities or convertible debt securities  our stockholders may experience substantial dilution and the new securities may have greater rights  preferences or privileges than our existing common stock 
intangible assets may be impaired making it more difficult to obtain financing 
goodwill  capitalized software  non compete agreements and other intangible assets represent approximately of our total assets as of march  and represent more than our stockholders equity 
we may have to impair or write off these assets  which will cause a charge to earnings and could cause our stock price to decline 
any such impairments will also reduce our assets  as well as the ratio of our assets to our liabilities 
these balance sheet effects could make it more difficult for us to obtain capital  and could make the terms of capital we do obtain more unfavorable to our existing stockholders 
foreign currency fluctuations may impair our competitive position and affect our operating results 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates affect the prices of our applications and services and our expenses  and foreign currency losses will negatively affect profitability or increase losses 
approximately  and of our net sales were outside north america  principally in australia and the united kingdom  in the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
many of our expenses related to foreign sales  such as corporate level administrative overhead and development  are denominated in us dollars 
when accounts receivable and accounts payable arising from international sales and services are converted to us dollars  the resulting gain or loss contributes to fluctuations in our operating results 
we do not hedge against foreign currency exchange rate risks 
we have a single customer representing a significant amount of our business 
toys r us  inc toys accounted for  and of our net sales for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
while we have a development agreement with this customer  toys has the right to terminate the agreement without cause with limited advance notice 
a reduction  delay or cancellation of orders from toys would significantly reduce our revenues and force us to substantially curtail operations 
we cannot provide any assurances that toys or any of our current customers will continue at current or historical levels or that we will be able to obtain orders from new customers 
if we lose the services of any member of our senior management or key technical and sales personnel  or if we are unable to retain or attract additional technical personnel  our ability to conduct and expand our business will be impaired 
we are heavily dependent on barry m 
schechter  our chairman  harvey braun  our chief executive officer  and steven beck  our president and chief operating officer 
mr 
schechter has an employment agreement with us  which expires september  and may be terminated on days notice 
we do not have any written employment agreements with mr 
braun or mr 
beck 
we also believe our future success will depend largely upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled software programmers  managers  and sales and marketing personnel 
competition for personnel is intense  particularly in international markets 
the software industry is characterized by a high level of employee mobility and aggressive recruiting of skilled personnel 
we compete against numerous companies  including larger  more established companies  for our personnel 
we may not be successful in attracting or retaining skilled sales  technical and managerial personnel 
the loss of key employees or our inability to attract and retain other qualified employees could negatively affect our financial performance and cause our stock price to decline 
we are dependent on the retail industry  and if economic conditions in the retail industry further decline  our revenues may also decline 
retail sales have been and may continue to be slow 
our future growth is critically dependent on increased sales to the retail industry 
we derive the substantial majority of our revenues from the licensing of software applications and the performance of related professional and consulting services to the retail industry 
demand for our applications and services could decline in the event of consolidation  instability or more downturns in the retail industry 
this decline would likely cause reduced sales and could impair our ability to collect accounts receivable 
the result would be reduced earnings and weakened financial condition  each or both of which would likely cause our stock price to decline 
the success of our customers is directly linked to economic conditions in the retail industry  which in turn are subject to intense competitive pressures and are affected by overall economic conditions 
in addition  the retail industry may be consolidating  and it is uncertain how consolidation will affect the industry 
the retail industry as a whole is currently experiencing increased competition and weakening economic conditions that could negatively impact the industry and our customers ability to pay for our products and services 
such consolidation and weakening economic conditions have in the past  and may in the future  negatively impact our revenues  reduce the demand for our products and may negatively impact our business  operating results and financial condition 
weakening economic conditions and the september  terrorist attack have adversely impacted sales of our software applications  and we believe mid tier specialty retailers may be reluctant during the current economic slowdown to make the substantial infrastructure investment that generally accompanies the implementation of our software applications 
also  the current war in iraq and the anticipated burden of rebuilding that country s infrastructure has led to some uncertainty in the economic climate  which may adversely impact our business 
there may be an increase in customer bankruptcies due to weak economic conditions 
we have in the past and may in the future be impacted by customer bankruptcies 
during weak economic conditions  such as those currently being experienced in many geographic regions around the world  there is an increased risk that certain of our customers will file bankruptcy 
when our customers file bankruptcy  we may be required to forego collection of pre petition amounts owed  and to repay amounts remitted to us during the day preference period preceding the filing 
accounts receivable balances related to pre petition amounts may in certain of these instances be large due to extended payment terms for software license fees  and significant billings for consulting and implementation services on large projects 
the bankruptcy laws  as well as the specific circumstances of each bankruptcy  may severely limit our ability to collect pre petition amounts  and may force us to disgorge payments made during the day preference period 
we also face risk from international customers which file for bankruptcy protection in foreign jurisdictions  in that the application of foreign bankruptcy laws may be less certain or harder to predict 
although we believe that we have sufficient reserves to cover anticipated customer bankruptcies  there can be no assurance that such reserves will be adequate  and if they are not adequate  our business  operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected 
we may not be able to maintain or improve our competitive position because of the intense competition in the retail software industry 
we conduct business in an industry characterized by intense competition 
most of our competitors are very large companies with an international presence 
we must also compete with smaller companies which have been able to develop strong local or regional customer bases 
many of our competitors and potential competitors are more established  benefit from greater name recognition and have significantly greater resources than us 
our competitors may also have lower cost structures and better access to the capital markets than us 
as a result  our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
our competitors may o introduce new technologies that render our existing or future products obsolete  unmarketable or less competitive  o make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with other solution providers  which would increase the ability of their products to address the needs of our customers  and o establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with our current or future strategic partners  which would limit our ability to compete through these channels 
we could be forced to reduce prices and suffer reduced margins and market share due to increased competition from providers of offerings similar to  or competitive with  our applications  or from service providers that provide services similar to our services 
competition could also render our technology obsolete 
for a further discussion of competitive factors in our industry  see business under the heading competition 
our markets are subject to rapid technological change  so our success depends heavily on our ability to develop and introduce new applications and related services 
the retail software industry is characterized by rapid technological change  evolving standards and wide fluctuations in supply and demand 
we must cost effectively develop and introduce new applications and related services that keep pace with technological developments to compete 
if we do not gain market acceptance for our existing or new offerings or if we fail to introduce progressive new offerings in a timely or cost effective manner  our financial performance will suffer 
the success of application enhancements and new applications depends on a variety of factors  including technology selection and specification  timely and efficient completion of design  and effective sales and marketing efforts 
in developing new applications and services  we may o fail to respond to technological changes in a timely or cost effective manner  o encounter applications  capabilities or technologies developed by others that render our applications and services obsolete or non competitive or that shorten the life cycles of our existing applications and services  o experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and marketing of these new applications and services  or o fail to achieve market acceptance of our applications and services 
the life cycles of our applications are difficult to estimate  particularly in the emerging electronic commerce market 
as a result  new applications and enhancements  even if successful  may become obsolete before we recoup our investment 
our proprietary rights offer only limited protection and our competitors may develop applications substantially similar to our applications and use similar technologies which may result in the loss of customers 
we may have to bring costly litigation to protect our proprietary rights 
our success and competitive position is dependent in part upon our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our intellectual property 
our intellectual property includes our trademarks  trade secrets  copyrights and other proprietary information 
our efforts to protect our intellectual property may not be successful 
effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries 
we hold no patents 
consequently  others may develop  market and sell applications substantially equivalent to ours or utilize technologies similar to those used by us  so long as they do not directly copy our applications or otherwise infringe our intellectual property rights 
we may find it necessary to bring claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to protect our trade secrets 
these actions would likely be costly and divert management resources 
these actions could also result in counterclaims challenging the validity of our proprietary rights or alleging infringement on our part 
the ultimate outcome of any litigation will be difficult to predict 
our applications may be subject to claims they infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties  which may expose us to litigation 
we may become involved in litigation involving patents or proprietary rights 
patent and proprietary rights litigation entails substantial legal and other costs  and we do not know if we will have the necessary financial resources to defend or prosecute our rights in connection with any such litigation 
responding to and defending claims related to our intellectual property rights  even ones without merit  can be time consuming and expensive and can divert management s attention from other business matters 
in addition  these actions could cause application delivery delays or require us to enter into royalty or license agreements 
royalty or license agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if they are available at all 
any or all of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
development and marketing of our offerings depends on strategic relationships with other companies 
our existing strategic relationships may not endure and may not deliver the intended benefits  and we may not be able to enter into future strategic relationships 
since we do not possess all of the technical and marketing resources necessary to develop and market our offerings to their target markets  our business strategy substantially depends on our strategic relationships 
while some of these relationships are governed by contracts  most are non exclusive and all may be terminated on short notice by either party 
if these relationships terminate or fail to deliver the intended benefits  our development and marketing efforts will be impaired and our revenues may decline 
we may not be able to enter into new strategic relationships  which could put us at a disadvantage to those of our competitors  which do successfully exploit strategic relationships 
our primary computer and telecommunications systems are in a limited number of geographic locations  which makes them more vulnerable to damage or interruption 
this damage or interruption could harm our business 
substantially all of our primary computer and telecommunications systems are located in two geographic areas 
these systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire  earthquake  water damage  sabotage  flood  power loss  technical or telecommunications failure or break ins 
our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for our lost business and will not compensate us for any liability we incur due to our inability to provide services to our customers 
although we have implemented network security measures  our systems are vulnerable to computer viruses  physical or electronic break ins and similar disruptions 
these disruptions could lead to interruptions  delays  loss of data or the inability to service our customers 
any of these occurrences could impair our ability to serve our customers and harm our business 
if product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us  we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our applications 
our business exposes us to product liability risks 
any product liability or other claims brought against us  if successful and of sufficient magnitude  could negatively affect our financial performance and cause our stock price to decline 
our applications are highly complex and sophisticated and they may occasionally contain design defects or software errors that could be difficult to detect and correct 
in addition  implementation of our applications may involve customer specific customization by us or third parties  and may involve integration with systems developed by third parties 
these aspects of our business create additional opportunities for errors and defects in our applications and services 
problems in the initial release may be discovered only after the application has been implemented and used over time with different computer systems and in a variety of other applications and environments 
our applications have in the past contained errors that were discovered after they were sold 
our customers have also occasionally experienced difficulties integrating our applications with other hardware or software in their enterprise 
we are not currently aware of any defects in our applications that might give rise to future lawsuits 
however  errors or integration problems may be discovered in the future 
such defects  errors or difficulties could result in loss of sales  delays in or elimination of market acceptance  damage to our brand or to our reputation  returns  increased costs and diversion of development resources  redesigns and increased warranty and servicing costs 
in addition  third party products  upon which our applications are dependent  may contain defects which could reduce or undermine entirely the performance of our applications 
our customers typically use our applications to perform mission critical functions 
as a result  the defects and problems discussed above could result in significant financial or other damage to our customers 
although our sales agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims  we do not know if these limitations of liability are enforceable or would otherwise protect us from liability for damages to a customer resulting from a defect in one of our applications or the performance of our services 
our product liability insurance may not cover all claims brought against us 
softline limited has the right to acquire a controlling percentage of our common stock  so we may be effectively controlled by softline  and our other stockholders are unable to affect the outcome of stockholder voting 
softline limited beneficially owns of our outstanding common stock  including shares softline has the right to acquire upon conversion of its series a convertible preferred stock 
ivan m 
epstein  softline s chief executive officer  and robert p 
wilkie  softline s chief financial officer  serve on our board of directors 
if softline converts its series a preferred stock  it may have effective control over all matters affecting us  including o the election of all of our directors  o the allocation of business opportunities that may be suitable for softline and us  o any determinations with respect to mergers or other business combinations involving us  o the acquisition or disposition of assets or businesses by us  o debt and equity financing  including future issuance of our common stock or other securities  o amendments to our charter documents  o the payment of dividends on our common stock  and o determinations with respect to our tax returns 
our business may be disadvantaged or harmed if softline s interests receive priority over our interests 
conflicts of interest have and will continue to arise between softline and us in a number of areas relating to our past and ongoing relationships 
conflicts may not be resolved in a manner that is favorable to us  and such conflicts may result in harmful consequences to our business or prospects 
softline s influence on our company could make it difficult for another company to acquire us  which could depress our stock price 
softline s potential voting control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger  takeover or other change of control transaction that may otherwise be beneficial to our business or our stockholders 
as a result  softline s control could reduce the price that investors may be willing to pay in the future for shares of our stock  or could prevent any party from attempting to acquire us at any price 
our stock price has been highly volatile 
the market price of our common stock has been  and is likely to continue to be  volatile 
when we or our competitors announce new customer orders or services  change pricing policies  experience quarterly fluctuations in operating results  announce strategic relationships or acquisitions  change earnings estimates  experience government regulatory actions or suffer from generally adverse economic conditions  our stock price could be affected 
some of the volatility in our stock price may be unrelated to our performance 
recently  companies similar to ours have experienced extreme price fluctuations  often for reasons unrelated to their performance 
for further information on our stock price trends  see price range of common stock 
we have never paid a dividend on our common stock and we do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future 
we have not previously paid any cash or other dividend on our common stock 
we anticipate that we will use our earnings and cash flow for repayment of indebtedness  to support our operations  and for future growth  and we do not have any plans to pay dividends in the foreseeable future 
softline is entitled to dividends on its series a convertible preferred stock in preference and priority to common stockholders 
future equity financing s may further restrict our ability to pay dividends 
the terms of our preferred stock may reduce the value of your common stock 
we are authorized to issue up to  shares of preferred stock in one or more series 
we issued  shares of series a convertible preferred stock to softline in may our board of directors may determine the terms of subsequent series of preferred stock without further action by our stockholders 
if we issue additional preferred stock  it could affect your rights or reduce the value of your common stock 
in particular  specific rights granted to future holders of preferred stock could be used to restrict our ability to merge with or sell our assets to a third party 
these terms may include voting rights  preferences as to dividends and liquidation  conversion and redemption rights  and sinking fund provisions 
we are actively seeking capital  and some of the arrangements we are considering may involve the issuance of preferred stock 
failure to comply with the american stock exchange s listing standards could result in our delisting from that exchange and limit the ability to sell any of our common stock 
our stock is currently traded on the american stock exchange 
the exchange has published certain guidelines it uses in determining whether a security warrants continued listing 
these guidelines include financial  market capitalization and other criteria  and as a result of our financial condition or other factors  the american stock exchange could in the future determine that our stock does not merit continued listing 
if our stock were delisted from the american stock exchange  the ability of our stockholders to sell our common stock could become limited  and we would lose the advantage of some state and federal securities regulations imposing lower regulatory burdens on exchange traded issuers 
delaware law and some provisions of our charter and bylaws may adversely affect the price of your stock 
special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the board  the chief executive officer or the board of directors 
stockholders have no right to call a meeting and may not act by written consent 
stockholders must also comply with advance notice provisions in our bylaws in order to nominate directors or propose matters for stockholder action 
these provisions of our charter documents  as well as certain provisions of delaware law  could delay or make more difficult certain types of transactions involving a change in control of the company or our management 
delaware law also contains provisions that could delay or make more difficult change in control transactions 
as a result  the price of our common stock may be adversely affected 
shares issued upon the exercise of options  warrants  debentures and convertible notes could dilute your stock holdings and adversely affect our stock price 
we have issued options and warrants to acquire common stock to our employees and certain other persons at various prices  some of which are or may in the future have exercise prices at below the market price of our stock 
we currently have outstanding options and warrants for  shares 
of these options and warrants   have exercise prices above the recent market price of per share as of june   and  have exercise prices at below that recent market price 
if exercised  these options and warrants will cause immediate and possibly substantial dilution to our stockholders 
our existing stock option plan currently has approximately  shares available for issuance as of june  future options issued under the plan may have further dilutive effects 
we issued to toys r us  our major customer  a note convertible into  shares of common stock 
this note has a conversion price of 
this note will have a dilutive effect on stockholders if converted 
we issued to entities related to icm asset management notes that are convertible into  shares of common stock 
these notes have a conversion price of per share  which is currently below the recent market price of 
these notes will have a dilutive effect on stockholders if converted 
we also recently issued to a group of investors debentures that are convertible into  shares of common stock 
these debentures have a conversion price of  which is below the recent market price of 
these debentures will have a dilutive effect on stockholders of converted 
we issued to union bank of california  na an unsecured note that is convertible into shares of common stock at a price per share of eighty percent of the average share closing price of our common stock for the ten trading day period immediately preceding the maturity date of the note 
this note will have a dilutive effect on stockholders if converted 
sales of shares pursuant to exercisable options  warrants  convertible notes  and convertible debentures could lead to subsequent sales of the shares in the public market  and could depress the market price of our stock by creating an excess in supply of shares for sale 
issuance of these shares and sale of these shares in the public market could also impair our ability to raise capital by selling equity securities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we are exposed to market risks  which include changes in foreign currency exchange rate as measured against the us dollar 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we conduct business in various foreign currencies  primarily in europe and until february  australia 
sales are typically denominated in the local foreign currency  which creates exposures to changes in exchange rates 
these changes in the foreign currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar may positively or negatively affect our sales  gross margins and retained earnings 
we attempt to minimize currency exposure risk through decentralized sales  development  marketing and support operations  in which substantially all costs are local currency based 
there can be no assurance that such an approach will be successful  especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of the foreign currency 
we do not hedge against foreign currency risk 
approximately   and of our total net sales were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar for the periods ended march    and  respectively 
interest rate risk we do not have financial instruments or investment securities 
equity price risk we have no direct equity investments
