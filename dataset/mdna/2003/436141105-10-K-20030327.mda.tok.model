item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires us to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates affect  among other things  the amounts of receivables  rental and merchandise inventories  property and equipment  net  goodwill  deferred income tax assets  other liabilities  revenue  cost of revenue  and operating costs and expenses 
we base our judgments  assumptions and estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ significantly from amounts based on our judgments  assumption and estimates 
the following critical accounting policies involve significant judgments  assumptions and estimates  which affect amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue upon the rental and sale of our products 
rental revenue for extended rental periods when the customer chooses to keep the product beyond the original rental period is recognized when the extended rental period begins 
revenue recorded for extended rental periods is net of estimated amounts that we do not anticipate collecting based upon historical collection experience 
we continuously monitor actual collections 
estimates are revised when we believe it is appropriate in light of actual collection rates and other relevant circumstances 
historically  actual collections have approximated the related net revenue recorded 
however  if actual collections in the future are less than the related net revenue recorded  our results of operations would be adversely affected 
merchandise inventory valuation merchandise inventories  consisting primarily of video games  prerecorded videocassettes and dvds  concessions  and accessories held for resale  are stated at the lower of cost or market 
due to the numerous variables associated with the judgments and assumptions we make in estimating market values  and the effects of changes in circumstances affecting these estimates including the effects of competing products and technologies  both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to substantial uncertainties and  as additional information becomes known  we may change our estimates significantly 
amortization of rental inventory rental inventory  which includes vhs videocassettes  dvds and video games  is stated at cost and amortized over its estimated useful life to an estimated residual value 
our estimates of useful lives and residual values affect the amounts of amortization recorded  which in turn affects the carrying value of our rental inventory and cost of rental product and  upon the transfer of previously viewed items from rental inventory to merchandise inventory  the carrying value of our merchandise inventory 
for new release movies acquired for rental under revenue sharing arrangements  the studios share of rental revenue is expensed as revenue is earned net of average estimated residual values 
tapes  dvds and video games acquired for rental at fixed prices are amortized to estimated residual values in periods ranging from four months to five years 
due to the numerous variables associated with the judgments and assumptions we make in estimating useful lives and residual values of these items  and the effects of changes in circumstances affecting these estimates including the effects of competing products and technologies and actual selling prices obtainable for previously viewed product  both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to substantial uncertainties and  as additional information becomes known  we may change our estimates significantly 
for example  in the fourth quarter of  a number of observations led us to change our estimates of rental inventory lives and residual values  which resulted in a million increase to amortization expense in that quarter see note to the consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill we review long lived assets and goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we periodically review and monitor our internal management reports for indicators of impairment 
we consider a trend of unsatisfactory operating results that are not in line with management s expectations to be a primary indicator of potential impairment 
when an indicator of impairment is noted  assets are evaluated for impairment at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows eg  at the store level 
we deem a store to be impaired if a forecast of undiscounted future operating cash flows directly related to the store  including estimated disposal value  if any  is less than the asset carrying amount 
if a store is determined to be impaired  the loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount on our balance sheet of the store exceeds its fair value 
fair value is estimated using a discounted future cash flow valuation technique similar to that used by management in making a new investment decision 
considerable management judgment and assumptions are necessary to estimate discounted future cash flows 
due to the numerous variables associated with our judgments and assumptions relating to the valuation of our assets in these circumstances  and the effects of changes in circumstances affecting these valuations  both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates of the related impairment charges are subject to substantial uncertainties and  as additional information becomes known  our estimates may change significantly 
income taxes we calculate income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in our financial statements and tax returns 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets  including temporary timing differences and net operating loss carryforwards  to the amount expected to be realized in the future 
in the fourth quarter of  in light of significant doubt that existed regarding our future income and therefore our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards  we recorded a million valuation allowance on our million net deferred tax asset 
in and  as a result of our operating performance for each year  as well as anticipated future operating performance  we determined that it was more likely than not that certain future tax benefits would be realized 
as such we reversed million and million of this valuation allowance in and  respectively  which resulted in a corresponding increases in net income and corresponding increases decreases in our shareholders equity deficit 
while changes in the valuation allowance have no effect on the amount of income tax we pay or on our cash flows  the effects on our reported income and shareholders equity may be viewed by some investors and potential lenders as significant 
due to the numerous variables associated with our judgments  assumptions and estimates relating to the valuation of our deferred tax assets  and the effects of changes in circumstances affecting these valuations  both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates are subject to substantial uncertainties and  as additional information becomes known  we may change our estimates significantly 
legal contingencies our estimates of our loss contingencies for legal proceedings are based on various judgments and assumptions regarding the potential resolution or disposition of the underlying claims and associated costs 
due to the numerous variables associated with these judgments and assumptions  both the precision and reliability of the resulting estimates of the related loss contingencies are subject to substantial uncertainties 
we regularly monitor our estimated exposure to these contingencies and  as additional information becomes known  may change our estimates significantly 
results of operations summary results of operations our net income for was million compared to million in and a net loss of million in the improvement in operating results was primarily the result of improved operating performance in our existing store base  adjustments to our valuation allowance on our net deferred income tax asset see note to the consolidated financial statements and the closing of the e commerce operations at reel 
com in june of the large net loss in was primarily the result of special charges summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in our press release on february   we announced net income in of million reflecting the recognition of million in deferred tax assets which were previously unrecognized 
actual deferred tax assets recognized were million and have been reflected accordingly in these financial statements

also favorably impacting revenue in was the addition  on a weighted average basis  of stores 
the closure of reel 
com in june  which had total revenue of million in  unfavorably impacted revenue 
we ended with  superstores operating in states  compared to  superstores operating in states at the end of and  stores operating in states at the end of we currently offer a day rental program on all products in the majority of our stores 
new release videos and all dvds typically rent for 
catalog videos typically rent for 
since the fourth quarter of  we have not increased prices on new release videos  dvds or catalog videos 
video games rent for and  with games designed for the newer platforms renting for the higher amount 
customers who choose not to return movies within the applicable rental period are deemed to have commenced a new rental period of equal length at the same price 
revenue recorded for extended rental periods is net of estimated amounts that we do not anticipate collecting based upon historical collection experience 
rental revenue from initial rental periods was  million   million and  million for  and  respectively 
rental revenue from extended rental periods was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
our policies with respect to these extended rental periods have been the subject of litigation 
see item legal proceedings 
effective january   we began reporting sales and related costs of previously viewed rental inventory as rental product revenue and cost of rental product  respectively 
prior to january   we included sales and related costs of sales of previously viewed rental inventory in merchandise sales and cost of merchandise sales  respectively 
for comparative purposes  sales and related costs of sales of previously viewed rental inventory for and have been reclassified to conform to the presentation for the current year 
gross margin rental product margins rental gross margin as a percentage of rental revenue increased to in from in and in the company regularly evaluates and updates rental inventory accounting estimates 
effective october   estimated average residual values on new release movies was reduced from to for vhs and from to for dvd 
in addition  the estimated residual value of catalog dvd inventory was reduced from to 
these changes resulted in a million increase in cost of rental product in we also made several key observations that led us to change estimates regarding rental inventory lives and residual values during the fourth quarter of as a result of the growing demand for dvds  the estimated residual value of catalog vhs cassettes was reduced from to and the estimated useful life was reduced from five years to one year 
we adopted the changes in estimate prospectively on october   and recorded a charge of million 
by applying these changes prospectively  we also recorded incremental depreciation expense of approximately million and million in the fourth quarter of and in the first three quarters of  respectively 
excluding the impact of these changes in estimate  margins increased to in from in and in primarily due to a shift in revenue from vhs to dvd  which typically has higher margins 
merchandise sales margins merchandise sales gross margin as a percentage of merchandise sales increased to in from in and in the increase in margins compared to was primarily the result of an increase in the percentage of merchandise sales from our game crazy departments  which typically have higher margins than merchandise sales in our video stores 
the low margin in was primarily the result of operations of our former internet subsidiary  reel 
com  including a million charge for the discontinuation of their e commerce operations  and a million charge in our video stores to value the inventory on hand at december  at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
operating costs and expenses operating and selling total operating and selling expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased to in from in the percentage decrease is primarily the result of leverage on increased revenue 
total operating and selling expenses of million in increased million from million in the increase was primarily the result of increased variable costs associated with increased store sales volume and an increase of an additional game crazy departments in salary and wages increased million and other operating and selling expenses increased by million in compared to the prior year 
total operating and selling expenses of million in decreased million from million in total operating and selling expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to in from in impacting operating and selling expense in was a million charge for impaired property and equipment see note to consolidated financial statements and reel 
com operating expenses of million 
excluding the impairment charge and operating expenses of reel 
com  operating and selling expenses decreased million for as compared to the decrease was driven by decreases in advertising expense of million  other operating and selling expenses of million and depreciation expense of million  which were partially offset by an increase in store wages of million and occupancy costs of million 
the decrease in advertising expense was the result of the discontinuation of a mass media advertising campaign that ran in in  we returned to a more cost effective direct mail strategy 
the increases in store wages and occupancy costs were primarily due to the addition of weighted average stores compared to the prior year 
restructuring for closure of internet business on june   we announced that we would close down the e commerce business of reel 
com 
although we had developed a leading web site over the seven quarters after reel 
com was purchased in october of  reel 
com s business model of rapid customer acquisition led to large operating losses and required significant cash funding 
due to market conditions  we were unable to obtain outside financing for reel 
com  and could not justify continued funding from our superstore cash flow 
as a result of the discontinuation of reel 
com s e commerce operations  we recorded a total charge of million in the second quarter of  of which million was classified as a restructuring charge on the consolidated statement of operations and million was included in merchandise sales 
the million charge included million of accrued liabilities for contractual obligations  lease commitments  anticipated legal claims  legal fees  financial consulting  and other professional services incurred as a direct result of the closure of reel 
com 
the charge was reduced by million to million in the fourth quarter of  and also reduced by million and million in and  respectively  because we were able to negotiate termination of certain obligations and lease commitments more favorably than originally anticipated 
as of december   we had paid for all accrued liabilities net of reductions and do not anticipate further adjustments 
restructuring charge for store closures in december  we approved a restructuring plan involving the closure and disposition of stores that were not operating to our expectations the restructuring plan 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded charges aggregating million  including an million write down of property and equipment  a million write down of goodwill and an accrual for store closing costs of million 
the established reserve for cash expenditures is for lease termination fees and other store closure costs 
we have liquidated and plan to continue liquidating related store inventories through store closing sales  any remaining product will be used in other stores 
revenue for the stores subject to the store closure plan was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
operating results defined as income or loss before interest expense and income taxes was 
million loss  million loss and million in  and  respectively 
the operating results for the stores in the closure plan were included in the consolidated statement of operations 
during the twelve months ended december   we closed of the stores included in the plan and incurred  in expenses related to the closures and received  to exit one of the leases 
during the twelve months ended december   we closed one store included in the plan and incurred  in closure expenses 
in december of and  we amended the restructuring plan and removed stores and stores from the closure list  respectively 
in accordance with the amended plans  and updated estimates on closing costs  we reversed million and million of the original million charge  leaving a million and million accrual balance at december  and  respectively  for store closing costs 
at december   twelve stores remained to be closed under the restructuring plan 
general and administrative total general and administrative expenses of million in decreased million from million in total general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased to in compared to in general and administrative expenses in benefited from the reversal of a legal accrual in the amount of million as a result of the final confirmation of the settlement of our california exempt non exempt class action lawsuit for an amount less than anticipated 
the reversal of non cash stock compensation of million also benefited general and administrative expenses 
included in general and administrative expenses in were million of non cash compensation expense related to a stock grant to our chief executive officer as part of a three year employment agreement 
also included was million of non cash stock compensation associated with other grants under our stock option plans 
excluding the adjustments noted above  general and administrative expenses would have been million  or of revenue in the current year compared to million or in the prior year 
total general and administrative expenses of million in decreased million from million in total general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased to in compared to in included in general and administrative expenses in were employee loans written off or fully reserved for as doubtful for million  reserves established for pending litigation for million and reel 
com general and administrative expenses of million 
included in general and administrative expenses in were million of non cash compensation expense related to a stock grant to our chief executive officer as part of a three year employment agreement 
also included was million of non cash stock compensation associated with other grants under our stock option plans 
excluding the adjustments noted above  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of revenue to in compared to in the prior year 
we made the decision to invest in certain elements of the business  such as the store field supervision structure  the loss prevention function and human resources 
we believe these investments have had and will continue to have a direct impact on the business by improving the level of execution 
amortization of intangibles we adopted sfas as of january   and as a result we had no amortization expense in compared to million in sfas changes the accounting for goodwill and certain intangible assets from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
under sfas  goodwill and non amortizing intangible assets are adjusted whenever events or circumstances occur indicating that goodwill has been impaired 
when we evaluate goodwill and intangible assets for possible impairment  we compare the present value of estimated future cash flows of our  video stores our reporting unit to the asset recorded 
an impairment charge would be recorded to the extent that the asset recorded exceeds the present value of estimated future cash flows 
we did not recognize an impairment charge in amortization of intangibles decreased by million in compared to the decrease was primarily due to an impairment charge of million taken in the fourth quarter of related to acquired store goodwill as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements and the closure in june of of reel 
com  which had million of amortization expense in the prior year 
non operating income expense  net interest expense  net of interest income  decreased in compared to by million 
the reduction was primarily due to decreased levels of revolving credit borrowings and lower interest rates offset by incremental interest for bonds issued on december  on march   we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock  resulting in proceeds of million before fees and expenses  of which million was applied to the repayment of borrowings under our prior revolving credit facility 
interest expense  net of interest income  decreased in compared to  primarily due to decreased levels of revolving credit borrowings and lower interest rates 
income taxes our effective tax rate was a benefit of in compared to a benefit of in and a provision of in which varies from the federal statutory rate as a result of adjustments to deferred tax asset valuation allowances  non deductible executive compensation  non deductible goodwill amortization associated with the reel 
com acquisition and state income taxes 
in the fourth quarter of  in light of significant doubt that existed regarding our future income and therefore our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards  we recorded a million valuation allowance on our million net deferred tax asset 
in and  as a result of our operating performance for each year  as well as anticipated future operating performance  we determined that it was more likely than not that certain future tax benefits would be realized 
as such  we benefited by the reversal of million and million of the valuation allowance in and  respectively 
extraordinary loss on retirement of debt as a result of the early retirement of our prior revolving credit facility  we recorded an extraordinary charge of million in net of an income tax benefit of million to write off deferred financing costs 
rental inventory analysis of rental inventory and investment in rental product we manage our rental inventories of movies under two distinct categories  new release and catalog 
new releases  which represent the majority of all movies acquired  are those movies that are primarily purchased on a weekly basis in large quantities to support demand upon their initial release by the studios and are generally held for relatively short periods of time 
catalog  or library  represents an investment in those movies we intend to hold for an indefinite period of time and represents a historic collection of movies that are maintained on a long term basis for rental to customers 
in addition to acquiring catalog movies from studios upon their initial release  we acquire previously released or older movies for catalog inventories to support new store openings and the build up of title selection for new platforms such as dvd 
during  we significantly increased the amount of dvds to be held in our catalog inventories by investing approximately million in dvd catalog 
purchases of new release movies are amortized over four months to current estimated average residual values of approximately for vhs and for dvd net of estimated allowances for losses 
purchases of vhs and dvd catalog are amortized on a straight line basis over one year and five years  respectively  to estimated residual values of for vhs and for dvd 
we regularly evaluate and update rental inventory accounting estimates 
effective october   estimated average residual values on new release movies was reduced from to for vhs and from to for dvd 
in addition  the estimated residual value of catalog dvd inventory was reduced from to 
for new release movies acquired under revenue sharing arrangements  the studios share of rental revenue is charged to cost of rental net of average estimated residual values  which are approximately equal to the residual values of purchased inventory  as outlined above 
the expense is recorded as revenue is earned on the respective revenue sharing titles 
the majority of games purchased are amortized over four months to an average residual value below 
games that the company expects to keep in rental inventory for an indefinite period of time are amortized on a straight line basis over two years to a current estimated residual value of 
when analyzing our rental inventory purchase activity  it is important to consider that we acquire new releases of movies under two different pricing structures  revenue sharing and sell through 
these methods will impact the amount of new releases held as rental inventory on our consolidated balance sheet 
under revenue sharing  in exchange for acquiring agreed upon quantities of tapes or dvds at reduced or no up front costs  we share agreed upon portions of the revenue that we derive from the tapes or dvds with the applicable studio 
the studio s share of rental revenue is expensed  net of an estimated residual value  as revenue is earned on the revenue sharing titles 
the resulting revenue sharing expense is considered a direct cost of sales rather than an investment in rental inventory 
under sell through pricing  we purchase movies from the studios with no obligation for future payments to the studios 
sell through purchases are recognized as an investment in rental inventory  which is then amortized to cost of sales over its estimated useful life 
purchases of rental inventories  as shown on our consolidated statement of cash flows  are not reflective of the total costs of acquiring movies for rental and are impacted by the mix of movies acquired under these pricing structures 
the following table summarizes our total acquisition costs of new releases in thousands twelve months ended december  new release purchases   revenue sharing expense   total new release investment   book value of transfers to merchandise inventory and tape loss   total new release investment  net   new release purchases include purchases of movies and games  as defined by our amortization policy  and the residual value of revenue sharing product acquired 
we acquired the majority of our dvds under the sell through pricing structure 
as of december   net rental inventory was million compared to million as of december   an increase of million 
the following table summarizes the related balance sheet activity in thousands balance at beginning of year   new release purchases   book value of transfers to merchandise inventory and tape loss   new release purchases  net   new stores and catalog   purchases of rental inventory  net   less rental inventory amortization   balance at year end   book value of transfers to merchandise inventory represents the residual book value of movies and games that are transferred from rental inventory to merchandise inventory to be sold as previously viewed product 
when the previously viewed product is sold  the residual book value is recognized as expense 
tape loss represents the residual book value of certain movies and games that are lost  stolen or damaged during the period 
catalog represents an investment in rental inventory that we intend to hold for an indefinite period of time 
we significantly increased the amount of dvds to be held in our catalog inventories by investing approximately million and million in and  respectively 
merchandise inventory merchandise inventory includes new vhs and dvd movies for sale  concessions and accessory items for sale  game crazy merchandise inventory and the residual book value of movies and games that are transferred from rental inventory to merchandise inventory to be sold as previously viewed product 
merchandise inventory increased million to million as of december   from million as of december  due to the expansion of our game crazy departments and an increase in new dvd movies for sale 
liquidity and capital resources overview our primary source of operating cash flow is generated from the rental and sales of videocassettes  dvds and games 
the amount of cash generated from operations in the twelve months ended december  funded the majority of our debt service requirements and maintenance capital expenditures with sufficient cash left over to remodel and remerchandise stores to include game crazy departments  open new video stores and continue strategic investments in dvd catalog product 
at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents on hand excluding cash held by trustee for refinancing 
during and early  we completed several refinancing transactions that lengthened maturities on our long term debt  lowered our effective interest rate and increased working capital availability see cash cash flow from financing activities below 
we believe that cash flow from operations  increased flexibility under our new credit facilities  cash on hand and trade credit will provide adequate liquidity and capital resources to execute our business plan for the foreseeable future 
however  we continue to analyze our capital structure and our business plan and from time to time may consider additional capital and or financing transactions as a source of incremental liquidity 
cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased by million or in the twelve months ended december  compared to the twelve months ended december  the increase was primarily due to improved operating performance in our existing store base 
we lease all of our stores  corporate offices  distribution centers and zone offices under non cancelable operating leases 
all of our stores have an initial operating lease term of five to years and most have options to renew for between five and additional years 
at december   the future minimum annual rental commitments under non cancelable operating leases were as follows operating year ending leases december  in thousands thereafter  cash used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities increased by million  or  to million in the twelve months ended december   from million in the twelve months ended december  on december   we completed the sale of million senior subordinated notes due and delivered net proceeds of million to the indenture trustee to redeem million of the million senior subordinated notes due excluding the cash held by the indenture trustee  our cash used in investing activities increased by million  or 
the increase was the result of investments in new stores and game crazy departments and the shift in product mix from vhs to dvd  resulting in a shift in product acquisition from revenue sharing to sell through pricing 
in  we opened video stores and game crazy departments compared to video stores and no game crazy departments in cash flow from financing activities net cash flow from financing activities was a million source of cash in the twelve months ended december   compared to a million use of cash in the corresponding period of the prior year 
as of december   we had million of cash held by the indenture trustee that was used to redeem million of our million senior subordinated notes on january  if the million had been paid prior to december   cash flow from financing activities would have been a million net use of cash 
on march   we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock  resulting in proceeds of million before fees and expenses  of which million was applied to the repayment of borrowings under our prior revolving credit facility 
on march   we obtained senior bank credit facilities from a syndicate of lenders led by ubs warburg llc and applied a portion of initial borrowings thereunder to repay all remaining borrowings under our prior revolving credit facility  which was then terminated 
the bank credit facilities consisted of a million senior secured term facility maturing in and a million senior secured revolving credit facility maturing in the interest payable on the credit facilities is based on variable interest rates libor or the prime bank rate at our option 
at december  we had a total of million outstanding under the senior secured term facility  no outstanding balance on the million senior secured revolving credit facility and we were in compliance with all financial covenants 
on december   we completed the sale of million senior subordinated notes due we delivered the net proceeds to the indenture trustee to redeem million of the million senior subordinated notes due  including accrued interest and the required call premium 
at december   the trustee was holding million and we continued to carry the million senior subordinated notes on our balance sheet  million of which was classified as a current liability titled subordinated notes to be retired by trustee 
on january   the redemption of million of the notes was completed 
the senior subordinated notes due are redeemable  at our option  beginning march   at rates starting at of the principal amount 
rates reduce annually through march   at which time the notes become redeemable at of the principal amount 
the terms of the notes may restrict  among other things  payment of dividends and other distributions  investments  the repurchase of capital stock or subordinated indebtedness  the making of certain other restricted payments  the incurrence of additional indebtedness or liens by the company or any of its subsidiaries  and certain mergers  consolidations and disposition of assets 
additionally  if a change of control occurs  as defined  each holder of the notes will have the right to require us to repurchase the holder s notes at of the principal amount 
on january   we obtained new senior secured credit facilities from a syndicate of lenders led by ubs warburg llc 
the new facilities consist of a million term loan facility and a million revolving credit facility  each maturing in we used the net proceeds from the transaction to repay amounts outstanding under our existing credit facilities which were due in  redeem the remaining million principal amount of our senior subordinated notes due that were outstanding as of december   and for general corporate purposes 
we completed the redemption of the senior subordinated notes on february  revolving credit loans under the new facility bear interest  at our option  at an applicable margin over the bank s base rate loan or the libor rate 
the initial margin over libor was for the term loan facility and will step down if certain performance targets are met 
the credit facility contains financial covenants determined in each case on the basis of the definitions and other provisions set forth in such credit agreement  some of which may become more restrictive over time  that include a maximum debt to adjusted ebitda test  minimum interest coverage test  and minimum fixed charge coverage test 
amounts outstanding under the credit agreement are collateralized by substantially all of our assets 
hollywood management company  and any future subsidiaries of hollywood entertainment corporation  are guarantors under the credit agreement 
after giving effect to all the transactions described above  maturities on long term obligations at december  for the next five years would have been as follows in thousands capital year ending subordinated credit leases december  notes facility other total thereafter    other financial measurements working capital at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million excluding cash held by trustee for refinancing and a working capital deficit of million 
the working capital deficit is primarily the result of the accounting treatment of rental inventory 
rental inventories are accounted for as non current assets under gaap because they are not assets which are reasonably expected to be completely realized in cash or sold in the normal business cycle 
although the rental of this inventory generates a substantial portion of our revenue  the classification of these assets as non current excludes them from the computation of working capital 
the acquisition cost of rental inventories  however  is reported as a current liability until paid and  accordingly  included in the computation of working capital 
consequently  we believe working capital is not as significant a measure of financial condition for companies in the video retail industry as it is for companies in other industries 
because of the accounting treatment of rental inventory as a non current asset  we will  more likely than not  operate with a working capital deficit 
we believe the current existence of a working capital deficit does not affect our ability to operate our business and meet obligations as they come due 
other financial measurements ebitda and discretionary free cash flow we believe other financial measurements  such as ebitda and discretionary free cash flow  as defined below  are additional measurements that are useful in understanding our operating results  including our ability to meet our growth plans and debt service requirements 
these measurements should not be viewed as a measure of financial performance under gaap or as substitute for gaap measurements  such as net income or cash flow from operations 
our calculation of these measurements is not necessarily comparable to those reported by other companies due to the lack of uniform definitions 
ebitda represents income from operations before special charges and certain accrual reversals plus depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of rental product plus minus non cash expense income 
following is a table calculating ebitda in thousands twelve months ended december  income from operations   reversal of accruals   depreciation and amortization   non cash items   ebitda   represents reversals of accruals for restructuring charges for the discontinuation of reel 
com e commerce operations and store closures as shown on separate line items on our consolidated statement of operations 
represents depreciation and amortization of property and equipment  and amortization of intangibles 
does not include amortization of rental product 
expense income items that are non cash in nature including compensation associated with certain stock option grants of million and million in and  respectively  and in  million of incremental depreciation expense associated with changes in estimated rental inventory lives and residual values that were adopted on a prospective basis october  discretionary free cash flow represents ebitda  less cash paid for interest and taxes  less maintenance capital expenditures  but before discretionary investments in expenditures that are not required to maintain existing stores eg investment in new store openings and new product platform rollouts 
we believe discretionary free cash flow is a useful measurement in determining our ability to meet our growth plans  satisfy working capital demands and meet our debt service requirements 
following is a table calculating discretionary free cash flow in thousands twelve months ended december  ebitda   less cash interest paid   cash taxes paid  maintenance capital expenditures   discretionary free cash flow   maintenance capital expenditures represents expenditures that we believe are necessary to maintain the existing store operations  including equipment  fixtures  leasehold improvements  remodeling projects  and implementing and upgrading store  office and distribution systems 
we anticipate that maintenance capital expenditures will be approximately million in discretionary free cash flow is used for debt service and discretionary investment expenditures including construction  equipment  fixtures  inventory  supplies and opening costs for new stores and game crazy departments and long term investments in rental inventory such as the expansion of dvd catalog 
in  discretionary investment expenditures were approximately million and included remerchandising stores to include a game crazy department  new video store openings and continued investment in dvd catalog product 
in  discretionary investment expenditures were approximately million primarily related to an expansion of our dvd catalog selections 
we anticipate that discretionary investment capital expenditures will be approximately million in primarily from our planned store openings and game crazy expansion

we face intense competition and risks associated with technological obsolescence  and we may be unable to compete effectively 
the home video and home video game industries are highly competitive 
we compete with local  regional and national video retail stores  including those operated by blockbuster  inc  the largest video retailer in the united states  and with mass merchants  specialty retailers  supermarkets  pharmacies  convenience stores  bookstores  mail order operations  online stores and other retailers  as well as with noncommercial sources  such as libraries 
substantially all of our stores compete with stores operated by blockbuster  most in very close proximity 
some of our competitors have significantly greater financial and marketing resources  market share and name recognition than hollywood 
as a result of direct competition with blockbuster and others  pricing strategies for videos and video games is a significant competitive factor in our business 
our home video and home video game businesses also compete with other forms of entertainment  including cinema  television  sporting events and family entertainment centers 
if we do not compete effectively with competitors in the home video industry or the home video game industry or with providers of other forms of entertainment  our revenues and or our profit margin could decline and our business  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations could be harmed 
we also compete with cable and direct broadcast satellite television systems 
these systems offer both movie channels  for which subscribers pay a subscription fee for access to movies selected by the provider at times selected by the provider  and pay per view services  for which subscribers pay a discrete fee to view a particular movie selected by the subscriber 
historically  pay per view services have offered a limited number of channels and movies  and have offered movies only at scheduled intervals 
over the past five years  however  advances in digital compression and other developing technologies have enabled cable and satellite companies  and may enable internet service providers and others  to transmit a significantly greater number of movies to homes at more frequently scheduled intervals throughout the day 
in addition  certain cable companies  internet service providers and others are testing or offering video on demand services 
as a concept  video on demand provides a subscriber with the ability to view any movie included in a catalog of titles maintained by the provider at any time of the day 
if video on demand or other alternative movie delivery systems whether alone or in conjunction with sophisticated digital recording systems that allow viewers to record  pause  rewind and fast forward live broadcasts  achieve the ability to enable consumers to conveniently view and control the movies they want to see when they want to see them and they receive the movies from the studios at the same time video stores do  such alternative movie delivery systems could achieve a competitive advantage over the traditional video rental industry 
while we believe that there presently exist substantial technological  economic and other impediments to alternative movie delivery systems achieving such a competitive advantage  if they did  our business and financial condition could suffer materially 
changes in the way that movie studios price videocassettes and or dvds could adversely affect our revenues and profit margins 
movie studios use various pricing models to maximize the revenues they receive for movies released to the home video industry 
historically  these pricing models have enabled a profitable video rental market to exist and compete effectively with mass retailers and other sellers of home videos 
if the studios were to significantly change their pricing policies in a manner that increases our cost of obtaining movies under revenue sharing arrangements or other arrangements  our revenues and or profit margin could decrease  and our business  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations would be harmed 
we can neither control nor predict with certainty whether the studios pricing policies will continue to enable us to operate our business as profitably as we can under current pricing arrangements 
we could lose a significant competitive advantage if the movie studios were to adversely change their current distribution practices 
currently  video stores receive movie titles approximately to days earlier than pay per view  cable and satellite distribution companies 
if movie studios were to change the current distribution schedule for movie titles such that video stores were no longer the first major distribution channel to receive a movie title after its theatrical or direct to video release or to provide for the earlier release of movie titles to competing distribution channels  we could be deprived of a significant competitive advantage  which could negatively impact the demand for our products and reduce our revenues and could harm our business  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations 
the video store industry could be adversely impacted by conditions affecting the motion picture industry 
the video store industry is dependent on the continued production and availability of motion pictures produced by movie studios 
any conditions that adversely affect the motion picture industry  including constraints on capital  financial difficulties  regulatory requirements and strikes  work stoppages or other disruptions involving writers  actors or other essential personnel  could reduce the number and quality of the new release titles in our stores 
this in turn could reduce consumer demand and negatively impact our revenues  which would harm our business  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations 
the failure of video game software and hardware manufacturers to timely introduce new products could hurt our ability to attract and retain video game rental customers 
we are dependent on the introduction of new and enhanced video games and game systems to attract and retain video game rental customers 
if manufacturers fail to introduce or delay the introduction of new games and systems  the demand for games available to us could decline  negatively impacting our revenues  and our business  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations could be harmed 
expansion of our store base has placed and may place pressure on our operations and management controls 
we have expanded the size of our store base and the geographic scope of operations significantly since our inception 
between and we opened an average of stores per year 
in we began an accelerated rollout of our game crazy departments  departments within our video stores that specialize in selling and trading video games  opening new departments 
we intend to open at least additional game crazy departments and grow our video store base by up to in this expansion has placed  and may continue to place  increased pressure on our operating and management controls 
to manage a larger store base and additional game crazy departments  we will need to continue to evaluate and improve our financial controls  management information systems and distribution facilities 
we may not adequately anticipate or respond to all of the changing demands of expansion on our infrastructure 
in addition  our ability to open and operate new stores in a profitable manner depends upon numerous contingencies  many of which are beyond our control 
these contingencies include but are not limited to our ability under the terms of the instruments governing our existing and future indebtedness to make capital expenditures associated with new store openings  our ability to locate suitable store sites  negotiate acceptable lease terms  and build out or refurbish sites on a timely and cost effective basis  our ability to hire  train and retain skilled associates  and our ability to integrate new stores into our existing operations 
we may also open stores in markets where we already have significant operations in order to maximize our market share within these markets 
if we do so  we cannot assure you that these newly opened stores will not adversely affect the revenues and profitability of those pre existing stores in any given market 
we depend on key personnel whom we may not be able to retain 
our future performance depends on the continued contributions of certain key management personnel 
from late through mid  we made significant changes to our management personnel  including reinstatement of mark j 
wattles  hollywood s founder and chief executive officer  full time as president  and hiring or restructuring other executive and senior management positions 
new members of management may not be able to successfully manage our existing operations and they may not remain with us 
a loss of one or more of these key management personnel  our inability to attract and retain additional key management personnel  including qualified store managers  or the inability of management to successfully manage our operations could prevent us from implementing our business strategy and harm our business  financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
the failure of our management information systems to perform as we anticipate could harm our business 
the efficient operation of our business is dependent on our management information systems 
in particular  we rely on an inventory utilization system used by our merchandise organization and in our distribution centers to track rental activity by individual videocassette  dvd and video game to determine appropriate buying  distribution and disposition of videocassettes  dvds and video games 
we use a scalable client server system to maintain information  updated daily  regarding revenue  current and historical rental and sales activity  demographics of store membership  individual customer history  and videocassette  dvd and video game rental patterns 
we rely on these systems as well as our proprietary point of sale and in store systems to keep our in store inventories at optimum levels  to move inventory efficiently and to track and record our performance 
the failure of our management information systems to perform as we anticipate could impair our ability to manage our inventory and monitor our performance and harm our business  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations 
instruments governing our existing and future indebtedness contain or may contain covenants that restrict our business 
instruments governing our bank credit facilities and our senior subordinated notes contain  and our future indebtedness may contain  covenants that  among other things  significantly restrict our ability to open new stores  incur additional indebtedness  guarantee third party obligations  enter into capital leases  create liens on assets  dispose of assets  repay indebtedness or amend indebtedness instruments  make capital expenditures  make investments  loans or advances  make acquisitions or engage in mergers or consolidations  and engage in certain transactions with our subsidiaries and affiliates 
we have a substantial amount of indebtedness and debt service obligations  which could adversely affect our financial and operational flexibility and increase our vulnerability to adverse conditions 
as of december   we had total consolidated long term debt  including capital leases  of approximately million excluding subordinated notes to be retired with cash held by trustee and on january   we completed the refinancing of our senior secured credit facilities 
we and our subsidiaries may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future  including indebtedness that would be secured by our assets or those of our subsidiaries 
if we increase our indebtedness  the related risks that we now face could intensify 
for example  it could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our indebtedness  limit our ability to borrow additional funds  increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limit our ability to fund future working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate or taking advantage of potential business opportunities  limit our ability to execute our business strategy successfully  and place us at a competitive disadvantage in our industry 
our ability to satisfy our indebtedness obligations will depend on our financial and operating performance  which may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and is subject to economic  industry and market conditions and to risks related to our business and other factors beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 
instruments governing our existing and future indebtedness contain or may contain various covenants  including covenants requiring us to meet specified financial ratios and tests 
our failure to comply with all applicable covenants could result in our indebtedness being immediately due and payable 
the instruments governing our existing indebtedness contain various covenants which  among other things  limit our ability to make capital expenditures and require us to meet specified financial ratios  which generally become more stringent over time  including a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum interest and rent coverage ratio 
the instruments governing our future indebtedness may impose similar or other restrictions and may require us to meet similar or other financial ratios and tests 
our ability to comply with covenants contained in the instruments governing our existing and future indebtedness may be affected by events and circumstances beyond our control 
if we breach any of these covenants  one or more events of default  including cross defaults between multiple components of our indebtedness  could result 
these events of default could permit our creditors to declare all amounts owing to be immediately due and payable  and terminate any commitments to make further extensions of credit 
if we were unable to repay indebtedness owed to our secured creditors  they could proceed against the collateral securing the indebtedness owed to them 
at december   we were in compliance with all covenants contained within our debt agreements 
we are subject to governmental regulations that impose obligations and restrictions and may increase our costs 
we are subject to various us federal and state laws that govern  among other things  the disclosure and retention of our video rental records and access and use of our video stores by disabled persons  and are subject to various state and local licensing  zoning  land use  construction and environment regulations 
furthermore  changes in existing laws  including environmental and employment laws  new laws or increases in the minimum wage may increase our costs 
terrorist attacks  such as the attacks that occurred in new york and washington  dc on september   and other acts of violence or war may affect the markets on which our common stock trades  the markets in which we operate  our operations and our profitability 
any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease further or result in increased volatility in the united states and worldwide financial markets and economy 
they could also impact consumer television viewing habits and may reduce the amount of time available for watching rented movies  which could adversely impact our revenue 
they also could result in an economic recession in the united states or abroad 
any of these occurrences could harm our business  financial condition or results of operations  and may result in the volatility of the market price for our securities and on the future price of our securities 
terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war may negatively affect our operations and your investment 
there can be no assurance that there will not be further terrorist attacks or other acts of violence or war against the united states or united states businesses 
also  as a result of terrorism  the united states has entered into armed conflict 
these attacks or armed conflicts may directly impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers 
furthermore  these attacks or armed conflicts may make travel and the transportation of our supplies and products more difficult and more expensive and ultimately affect our revenues 
our quarterly operating results will vary  which may affect the value of our securities in a manner unrelated to our long term performance 
our quarterly operating results have varied in the past and we expect that they will continue to vary in the future depending on a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
factors that may cause our quarterly operating results to vary include the level of demand for movie rentals and purchases  existing and future competition from providers of similar products and alternative forms of entertainment  the prices for which we are able to rent or sell our products  the availability and cost to us of new release movie titles  changes in other significant operating costs and expenses  weather  seasonality  variations in the number and timing of store openings  the performance of newer stores  acquisitions by us of existing video stores  the success of new business initiatives and related acquisitions  other factors that may affect retailers in general  changes in movie rental habits resulting from domestic and world events  actual events  circumstances  outcomes and amounts differing from judgments  assumptions and estimates used in determining the amount of certain assets including the amounts of related valuation allowances  liabilities and other items reflected in our consolidated financial statements  and acts of god or public authorities  war  civil unrest  fire  floods  earthquakes  acts of terrorism and other matters beyond our control 
our securities may experience extreme price and volume fluctuations 
the market price of our securities has been and can be expected to be significantly affected by a variety of factors  including public announcements concerning us  our competitors or the home video rental industry  fluctuations in our operating results  introductions of new products or services by us or our competitors  the operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies  and changes in analysts revenue or earnings estimates 
in addition to the foregoing  the market price of our debt securities may be significantly affected by change in market rates of interest  yields obtainable from investments in comparable securities  credit ratings assigned to our debt securities by third parties and perceptions regarding our ability to pay our obligations on our debt securities 
in the past  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have been the target of securities class action litigation 
if we were sued in a securities class action  we could incur substantial costs and suffer from a diversion of our management s attention and resources 
future sales of shares of our common stock may negatively affect our stock price 
if we or our shareholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  the market price of our common stock could fall 
in addition  sales of substantial amounts of our common stock might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future 
we do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we do not expect to declare dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
the instruments governing our existing and future indebtedness contain or may contain provisions prohibiting or limiting the payment of dividends on our common stock 
provisions of oregon law and our articles of incorporation may make it more difficult to acquire us  even though an acquisition may be beneficial to our shareholders 
provisions of oregon law condition the voting rights that would otherwise be associated with any shares of our common stock that may be acquired in specified transactions deemed to constitute a control share acquisitions upon approval by our shareholders excluding  among other things  the acquirer in any such transaction 
provisions or oregon law also restrict  subject to specified exceptions  the ability of a person owning or more of our common stock to enter into any business combination transaction with us 
in addition  under our articles of incorporation  our board of directors has the authority to issue up to million shares of preferred stock and to fix the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of those shares without any further vote or action by the shareholders 
the foregoing provisions of oregon law and our articles of incorporation have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of hollywood  may discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price of our common stock and may adversely affect the market price of  and the voting and other rights of the holders of  our common stock and the occurrence of a control share acquisition may constitute an event of default under  or otherwise require us to repurchase or repay  our indebtedness 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  operating results  or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
we have entered into certain market risk sensitive financial instruments for other than trading purposes  principally short term and long term debt 
historically  and as of december   we have not held derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities 
however  we may in the future enter into such instruments for the purpose of addressing market risks  including market risks associated with variable rate indebtedness 
the interest payable on our bank credit facility is based on variable interest rates equal to a specified eurodollar rate or base rate and is therefore affected by changes in market interest rates 
if variable base rates had increased in compared to the end of  our interest expense would have increased by approximately million based on our outstanding balance on the facility as of december  the fair market value of long term fixed interest rate debt is also subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the estimated fair value of our long term fixed interest rate debt at december  was million including million of our senior subordinated notes that were redeemed after december   but before the date of this filing 
we believe the effect of an estimated change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our future operating results or cash flows with respect to our fixed interest rate debt 
fair values were determined from quoted market prices
