item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations recent developments on january   we announced the achievement of the phase iii clinical trial milestone under our agreement with pall corporation  thereby triggering a million investment by pall in vitex common stock 
this investment will be priced at per share  the average of recent market prices  and will close if we secure more than an additional million in equity financing  including through the rights offering described below  on or before september  also on january   we announced the filing of a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission for a proposed rights offering of our common stock with a maximum value of approximately million through the distribution of subscription rights to all our shareholders 
under the terms of the rights offering  which remain subject to change  shareholders will receive subscription rights for each share of common stock which they own at the record date thereby entitling them to purchase shares of vitex common stock representing a total of approximately million shares 
holders who exercise their basic subscription right will have oversubscription rights to purchase any unsubscribed shares 
the exercise price will be per share  the same pricing as the pall million phase iii milestone investment 
we have received expressions of interest from certain institutional and venture capital shareholders and their affiliates in exercising their basic and oversubscription rights to purchase common stock under the proposed rights offering 
as of march   expressions of interest total between million and million 
we intend to close the pall million investment commitment concurrently with the rights offering resulting in anticipated minimum gross proceeds from the two transactions of between million and million 

table of contents critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
our actual results could differ from these estimates 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results and the accounting policies most critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements include the following research and development revenue and cost recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
revenues under partner research collaborations are recognized as we incur research costs eligible for reimbursement under the collaboration agreements 
non refundable up front and milestone payments related to license and distribution agreements are deferred and amortized over the period in which the licensee has distribution rights 
the company continually reviews these estimates that could result in a change in the deferral period 
amounts received in advance of the incurrence of reimbursable research expenses are deferred and recognized when the related expenses have been incurred 
prior to the divestiture of our plasma operations in august  we recognized revenue from processing services when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement existed  the processing services were rendered  certain quality control requirements were met and risk of loss passed to the customer 
research and development costs are charged to operations as incurred 
long lived assets our long lived assets  which consist of property and equipment and intangible assets  are recorded at cost and amortized over the estimated useful life of the asset 
we generally depreciate property and equipment using the straight line method over their economic life  which ranges from to years 
we amortize acquired intangible assets using the straight line method over their economic lives  which range from to years 
determining the economic lives of our long lived assets requires us to make significant judgments and estimates  and can materially impact our operating results 
asset impairments we review the valuation of long lived assets  including property and equipment and intangible assets  under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we are required to assess the recoverability of long lived assets on an interim basis whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an interim impairment review include the following significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our overall business  significant decrease in the market value of an asset  significant adverse change in the company s business or its industry  and significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period 
in accordance with sfas no 
 when we determine that the carrying value of applicable long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we 
table of contents evaluate whether the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of that asset 
if such a circumstance were to exist  we would measure an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount of the particular long lived asset or group of assets exceeds its fair value 
we would determine the fair value based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
use of different estimates and judgments on any of these factors could yield materially different results in our analysis  and could result in significantly different asset impairment charges 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill is required to be tested for impairment annually in lieu of being amortized 
we have selected the fourth quarter as the period to perform the annual test 
furthermore  goodwill is required to be tested for impairment on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment loss has been incurred 
an impairment loss shall be recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
impairment losses shall be recognized in operations 
we adopted sfas no 
during the first quarter of without a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
contingencies contingencies are addressed by assessing the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is made after reviewing the relevant facts and circumstances  seeking outside professional advice of lawyers or accountants where appropriate  and then making and recording our best judgment of potential loss under the guidance of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 contingencies 
this process is repeated in each reporting period as circumstances evolve and are reevaluated 
any changes in our assumptions or estimates that impact our estimates of loss will be recorded in operations immediately in the period of the change 
results of operations fiscal year as compared to fiscal year net revenues partner research funding decreased by million to million for fiscal year in comparison with as a result of our august modification of the pall collaboration 
under terms of that modification  we assumed responsibility from pall for funding of the inactine red cell program 
prior to august  partner research funding was principally from pall corporation 
processing revenue for was related to the plasma operations which we divested in august  accordingly  we had no processing revenue in research and development our research and development activities all relate to the development of pathogen inactivation technologies for blood products of which our inactine chemistry is currently the core technology and our inactine pathogen reduction system for red cells the inactine system is the lead product candidate 
the inactine system has completed phase i and phase ii clinical trials in human subjects and has now entered phase iii trials in the united states 
our research and development spending on pathogen inactivation technologies principally includes our internal research efforts  scientific and development work under contract to independent vendors  our intellectual property protection efforts and clinical trials conducted by medical institutions 
research and development 
table of contents spending on pathogen inactivation technologies totaled million for as compared to million for  an increase of million  or percent 
the increase from includes a non recurring million royalty prepayment in in connection with engineering services for the inactine system as well as component development costs and outside studies of the safety profile of the inactine system 
in fiscal year  research and development spending totaled million 
cumulatively  we have invested million in research and development on pathogen inactivation technologies for blood products since our inception in  including the cost of in process research and development resulting from our merger with pentose pharmaceuticals  inc our phase iii clinical trial program for the inactine system began in december and we expect that program to continue into the second half of fiscal at that point  we will prepare a biologics license application bla for submission to the fda which initiates the final step of fda review  leading to a decision by the fda on approval to market the system in the us the time involved in this stage of the fda review is not within our control and we cannot reasonably estimate this time period 
we intend to introduce the inactine system into the us market shortly after receiving bla approval 
we anticipate that our research and development spending during the time leading to our filing of a bla  including the cost of conducting clinical trials  will be in the annual range of approximately million 
in parallel with this process  we will be developing and implementing a strategy to achieve marketing approval of the inactine system in the european community and japan 
we are currently in the course of developing this strategy and have not yet arrived at estimates of the timing and related cost 
the exact nature  timing and estimated costs of the efforts necessary to bring to market the product resulting from our pathogen inactivation research and development projects involve a number of key variables which are either unpredictable or outside our control  including the enrollment rates and results of the phase iii clinical trials  the length of the fda and foreign regulatory approval processes  the success of our fundraising efforts  our ability to establish and maintain relationships with marketing partners and strategic collaborators  and the timing of commencement of commercialization of our product 
these factors are also described elsewhere in this form k in the section entitled risk factors 
accordingly  we are unable to estimate  with any degree of precision  either the total future costs that will be required to continue and complete the commercialization of the inactine system  or the period in which we can expect material net cash inflows from the system 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million or percent to million in versus the prior year period 
the decrease reflects lower administrative staffing levels required for our operations subsequent to the divestiture of the plasma operations in august cost of sales cost of sales of million recorded in fiscal year contains costs incurred by the plasma operations prior to the divestiture of those operations on august  accordingly  there were no cost of sales in plasma operations impairment we recorded a net asset impairment charge of million during fiscal due to the divestiture of our plasma operations in august of that year 
in  we recorded credits of million primarily related to the million settlement of an ethanol tax dispute with the us bureau of alcohol  tobacco and firearms as well as the settlement of certain liabilities below recorded amounts 
interest income  net we earned net interest income of million in versus net interest income of million for the prior year 
the difference was due primarily to lower average term debt obligations during 
table of contents provision for income taxes for fiscal years and  we have recorded no income tax expense or benefit 
at december  and december   we established a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset positions of million and million  respectively 
realization of these net deferred tax assets will be based on  among other things  our ability to generate future taxable profits and utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits before they expire 
fiscal year as compared to fiscal year net revenues processing revenues decreased percent to million for fiscal year in comparison with million in fiscal year the results reflect a partial year of activity due to the divestiture of the plasma operations on august  the plasma operations were responsible for all reported processing revenues 
partner research funding  principally from pall corporation  increased by million or percent to million for the fiscal year versus fiscal year the increase reflects the acceleration of our research and development efforts in the inactine red blood cell program 
cost of sales cost of sales was million or percent of processing revenues in fiscal year versus million or percent of processing revenues in fiscal year the decrease in cost of sales reflects lower processing volume and the divestiture of the plasma operations in august as mentioned previously  cost of sales was for a partial year due to the august  divestiture of the plasma operations 
research and development research and development costs increased by million to million in fiscal year versus million in fiscal year our increased spending is concentrated in our inactine red cell pathogen reduction program which covered phase ii clinical trials in selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million in fiscal to million from million in the prior year 
the decrease reflects the effects of the divestiture of the plasma operations on august  plasma operations divestiture during fiscal year  we recorded a net charge of million for the divestiture of our plasma operations 
provision for income taxes for fiscal years and  we have recorded no income tax expense or benefit 
at december  and december   we established a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset positions of million and million  respectively 
realization of these net deferred tax assets will be based on  among other things  our ability to generate future taxable profits and utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits before they expire 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations through sales of common stock  issuance of short term and long term debt  capital lease financing arrangements and research and development funding 
at december   we had working capital of million  including cash and cash equivalents of million  in comparison with working capital of million  including cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million at december  the primary objectives for our investment of cash balances are safety of principal and liquidity 
available cash balances are historically invested in money market funds and in portfolios of investment grade corporate and us government securities 
during the year ended december   our total cash and investments position decreased by million primarily reflecting operating losses and changes in working capital of million  investments in property and equipment of million and repayment of capital lease obligations of million 
this spending was offset by borrowings of million under the pall corporation revolving credit facility and the receipt of million contingent consideration related to the divestiture of the plasma operations 
under our collaboration agreement  pall corporation is obligated to make a million investment in our common stock at an average market price upon initiation of phase iii clinical trials 
this milestone was achieved on december  resulting in pricing of per share for the investment 
the investment is expected to close concurrently with the rights offering as described below 
in addition  pall has made available to us a revolving credit facility in the total amount of million of which million was available for future drawdowns at december  in february  we drew the remaining million under the facility 
we are involved in discussions with potential distribution partners for the inactine red cell system 
these companies have marketing capabilities in different regions of the world and also have substantial technology and financial resources 
we expect that if we enter marketing collaborations with new partners  the terms of the arrangements would involve upfront and milestone payments to vitex 
at this date  we cannot predict the likelihood of closing new marketing partnerships in the near future or the likely terms of those partnerships 
on january   we filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission the sec for a proposed offering of our common stock with a maximum value of approximately million through the distribution of subscription rights to all our shareholders 
under terms of the rights offering  shareholders will receive subscription rights for each share of common stock which they own at the record date  thereby entitling them to purchase shares of vitex common stock representing a total of approximately million shares 
the exercise price will be per share  the same pricing as the pall million phase iii milestone investment commitment 
pall is required to complete its equity milestone investment if we close an equity financing of million or more prior to september  as of march   we have received non binding expressions of interest in the proposed rights offering totaling million to million 
with the rights offering in this minimum range  we intend to close the rights offering concurrently with the pall milestone investment resulting in anticipated minimum proceeds of million to million from the combined transactions 
as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements  if the total financing exceeds million  our credit facility with pall will mature and we will repay the current outstanding balance of million  the registration statement for the rights offering is currently under review by the sec 
the company intends to commence the rights offering shortly after the review is completed and the registration statement is declared effective by the sec 
however  there is no guarantee that we will be able to successfully complete these transactions 
at december   the company had cash and available borrowings under its revolving credit facility of approximately million 
management believes that these resources will only be adequate to support the company s operations into the second quarter of fiscal in the event that our fund raising efforts are not successful in raising the minimum proceeds indicated under the expressions of interest  the company intends to delay or reduce expenditures so as to continue its operations on a limited scale and within its available resources 

table of contents new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
 to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the transition guidance and annual disclosure provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years ending after december  the interim disclosure provisions are effective for financial reports containing financial statements for interim periods beginning after december  as the company did not make a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation in  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which clarifies disclosure and recognition measurement requirements related to certain guarantees 
the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements issued after december  and the recognition measurement requirements are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees issued or modified after december  the application of the requirements of fin did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
pro forma results of operations the following unaudited pro forma statements of operations are based on our historical consolidated financial statements after giving effect to the divestiture of our plasma operations as if the sale had occurred on the first day of fiscal year in deriving these unaudited pro forma statements  we eliminated revenues  cost of sales  research and development expenses  sales and marketing costs  divestiture adjustments and interest expense associated with the plasma operations from the historical financial statements 
these unaudited pro forma results have been prepared for comparative purposes only and do not purport to be indicative of the results of operations that actually would have been reported had the divestiture occurred on the first fiscal day of  or of our future results of operations

table of contents pro forma fiscal as compared to pro forma fiscal net revenues partner research funding decreased by million to million for fiscal year in comparison with as a result of our august modification of the pall collaboration 
under terms of that modification  we assumed responsibility from pall for funding of the inactine red cell program 
prior to august  partner research funding was principally from pall corporation 
research and development research and development costs of million for increased million or percent from the prior year 
the increase encompasses a non recurring million royalty prepayment in in connection with engineering services and increased costs of development and safety studies for the inactine pathogen reduction system for red cells the inactine system 
we began phase iii clinical trials for the inactine system in december and expect an increase in research and development spending in future quarters as we move forward with these trials 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased million or percent to million in versus the prior year period 
the decrease reflects lower administrative staffing levels required for our operations subsequent to the divestiture of the plasma operations in august as well as a credit of approximately million in the fourth quarter of fiscal for adjustment of compensation related accrued expenses 
interest income  net we earned interest income of million in  consistent with pro forma fiscal as compared to pro forma fiscal net revenues partner research funding  principally from pall corporation  increased by million or percent to million for the fiscal year versus fiscal year the increase reflects the acceleration of our research and development efforts in the inactine pathogen reduction system for red cells 
research and development research and development costs increased by million to million in fiscal year versus million in fiscal year our increased spending is concentrated in our inactine pathogen reduction system for red cells which covered phase ii clinical trials in fiscal year general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were slightly higher in fiscal at million versus million in fiscal due to increased legal costs 
interest income  net net interest income was million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year this reflects higher cash balances in fiscal where  under the pro forma scenario  divestiture proceeds were received on the first day of fiscal 
table of contents risk factors our business faces significant risks 
these risks include those described below and may include additional risks of which we are not currently aware or which we do not believe are material 
if any of the events or circumstances described in the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
these risks should be read in conjunction with the other information set forth in this report 
risks related to our business we have historically incurred operating losses and these losses will continue 
we have historically incurred substantial operating losses due to our research and development activities in blood safety and we expect these losses to continue for the foreseeable future 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
our year to date losses as of december  were million 
during the next several years we expect to continue our inactine development efforts and other research activities 
the inactine red blood cell phase iii clinical trial program will be conducted in the us and clinical studies will likely occur in other geographic markets 
product commercialization activities will be at a higher level and our expenditures for research and development will likely increase 
we are actively seeking marketing partners who would provide financial support to our inactine red blood cell program  however  at this time we are not able to assess the probability of success in attracting partners or the timing and amount of their financial support 
it is likely that we will continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future 
we will need additional capital in the future  but our access to such capital is uncertain 
our current resources are insufficient to fund all of our commercialization efforts 
as of december  we had cash on hand of  and funding commitments from pall corporation totaling  through a combination of a  equity milestone investment  if we secure more than an additional  in equity financing by september   plus available borrowings of  under a revolving credit facility 
as of march   we have drawn down the maximum available borrowings of  under the pall credit facility 
we are obligated to repay this amount to pall upon the earlier of august  and the date on which we receive at least  in equity financing 
we anticipate  based on expressions of interest we have received  that we will receive more than  in proceeds from our proposed rights offering and the anticipated milestone investment from pall 
accordingly  we expect that we will use a portion of the proceeds of this rights offering to repay the  obligation to pall 
presently  we are consuming approximately  cash per quarter 
we are proposing the sale of common stock in a maximum amount of approximately  under the terms of a rights offering to shareholders 
a combination of available cash  anticipated pall funding and a successful rights offering will provide sufficient cash resources for our activities during fiscal our capital needs beyond fiscal will depend on many factors  including our success in negotiating marketing partnerships  the extent of our research and development activities  the scope of our clinical trial program  the timing of regulatory approval for our products under development and the successful commercialization of our products 
our needs may also depend on the magnitude and scope of these activities  the progress and the level of success in our clinical trials  the costs of preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  changes in or terminations of existing collaboration and licensing arrangements  the establishment of additional collaboration and licensing arrangements and the cost of manufacturing scale up and development of marketing activities  if undertaken by us 
we do not have committed external sources of funding  and we may not be able to obtain additional funds on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our development programs  obtain funds through arrangements with collaboration partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to technologies  product candidates or products that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves  or 
table of contents license rights to technologies  product candidates or products on terms that are less favorable to us than might otherwise be available 
if we raise additional funds by issuing additional stock  further dilution to our stockholders may result  and new investors could have rights superior to existing stockholders 
if funding is insufficient at any time in the future  we may be unable to develop or commercialize our products  take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures 
our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on future financing 
kpmg llp  our independent auditors  have included an explanatory paragraph in their audit opinion on our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended december   which highlights that our current cash balances and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility are insufficient to support our operations until the end of the fiscal year ended december   thereby raising substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
the inclusion of a going concern explanatory paragraph in kpmg llp s audit opinion on our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended december  could have a detrimental effect on our stock price  the proposed rights offering and our ability to raise new capital 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the basis of a going concern  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
we have not made any adjustments to our consolidated financial statements as a result of the outcome of the uncertainty described above 
if we cannot continue as a going concern  we may have to liquidate our assets and we may be able to sell them for significantly less than the values at which they are carried on our consolidated financial statements 
any shortfall in the proceeds from the liquidation of our assets would directly reduce the amounts that holders of our common stock would receive  if anything  in liquidation 
our success depends on new products and systems which we are developing  but may be unable to commercialize due to numerous factors  including regulatory requirements on both us and our customers 
the success of our business depends on the successful development and commercialization of pathogen reduction products and systems  including products based on the inactine system 
successful commercialization of our products and systems under development depends  in significant part  on our ability to complete their development in a timely fashion  demonstrate their safety in clinical trials  obtain and maintain patents or other proprietary protections  obtain required regulatory approvals  implement efficient  commercial scale manufacturing processes  sell into relevant markets before competitors  obtain approval for reimbursement under health care systems  and establish and maintain sales  marketing  distribution and development collaborations 
our pathogen inactivated blood products are under development and have not been approved by the fda for marketing in the united states or by regulatory authorities in other countries 
the process of obtaining regulatory approvals is generally lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
satisfaction of pre market approval or other regulatory requirements of the fda  or similar requirements of non united states regulatory agencies  typically takes several years  depending upon the type  complexity  novelty and intended purpose of the product 
the regulatory process includes pre clinical animal studies and clinical human trials of each product to establish its safety and efficacy 
during fiscal year we spent approximately  on research and development 
we must provide the fda and foreign regulatory authorities with pre clinical and clinical data that demonstrate our products are safe and effective before they can be approved for commercial sale 
our lead product  
table of contents inactine pathogen reduction system for red cells  has completed phase i and phase ii clinical trials in the united states 
we commenced pivotal phase iii clinical trials  consisting of two studies  in december the fda has concurred with the design of both of these studies 
the results from pre clinical studies and early clinical trials conducted by us will not ensure that results obtained in later clinical trials will be satisfactory to the fda or foreign regulatory authorities 
data obtained from pre clinical and clinical activities are susceptible to varying interpretations  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
our completion of clinical trials may also be delayed by slower than anticipated patient enrollment  negative or inconclusive clinical results or other adverse events occurring during the clinical trials 
therefore  we cannot ensure that clinical trials will demonstrate sufficient safety and efficacy to obtain required marketing approvals on a timely basis  if at all 
delays in our clinical testing or approval from government authorities will increase our product development costs and may impair our ability to commercialize our products and allow competitors to bring products to market before we do 
our clinical development plan for cellular products  including inactine  assumes that only data from laboratory studies  not from human clinical trials  will be required to demonstrate efficacy in reducing pathogens and that clinical trials for these products will instead focus on demonstrating therapeutic efficacy  safety and tolerability of treated blood components 
although we have held discussions with the fda concerning the proposed clinical plan for these products  this plan of demonstrating safety and efficacy may not ultimately be acceptable to the fda or the fda may reconsider any decision that this clinical plan is appropriate 
even if our products receive approval for commercial sale  their manufacture  storage  marketing and distribution are and will be subject to extensive and continuing regulation in the united states by the federal government  especially the fda  and state and local governments 
the failure to comply with these regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action  including  without limitation  withdrawal of approval  which would harm our business 
later discovery of problems with our product may result in additional restriction on the product  including withdrawal of the product from the market 
regulatory authorities may also require post marketing testing  which can involve significant expenses 
additionally  governments may impose new regulations  which could further delay or preclude regulatory approval of our products or result in significantly increased compliance costs 
in similar fashion to the fda  foreign regulatory authorities require demonstration of product quality  safety and efficacy prior to granting authorization for product registration which allows for distribution of the product for commercial sale 
international organizations  such as the world health organization  and foreign government agencies including those for the americas  middle east  europe  and asia and the pacific have laws  regulations and guidelines for reporting and evaluating the data on safety  quality and efficacy of new drug products 
although most of these laws  regulations and guidelines are very similar  each of the individual nations reviews all of the information available on the new drug product and makes an independent determination for product registration 
in addition to the regulatory requirements applicable to us and our products and systems  there are regulatory requirements applicable to our prospective customers  the blood banks that process and distribute both blood and blood products 
blood banks  such as the american red cross and the new york blood center  will be required to obtain approved license supplements from the fda before using products processed with our pathogen reduction systems 
fda delays in approving these supplements may deter some blood centers from using our products 
in addition  blood centers that do submit supplements may face disapproval or delays in approval that could in turn cause further delay or deter them from using our products 
if we fail to establish and maintain relationships with strategic collaborators and distributors  we may be unable to market our products 
we are dependent on enlisting strategic collaborators  including pall corporation  for sales  marketing and distribution support and for financial support in the development of our inactine pathogen reduction 
table of contents system for red cells 
we are currently seeking new distribution partners for our inactine system for red cells 
if we fail to develop new strategic partnerships or to maintain existing alliances  the failure will delay or possibly inhibit the commercialization of our products 
for example  in order to effectively market our products outside the united states  we may need to secure foreign marketing partners who have a strong presence in such foreign markets 
securing new corporate collaborators is a time consuming process  and we cannot guarantee that the negotiations with new collaborators will yield positive results 
even if we find additional corporate collaborators to assist in the commercialization of existing or new product candidates  the terms of the arrangements may not be favorable or acceptable to us 
our technologies are new and unproven 
we will need to gain market acceptance to generate revenue 
we believe that market acceptance of our products and systems will depend on our ability to provide acceptable evidence of their safety  efficacy and cost effectiveness 
implementation of our systems will involve new investment by our customers which we believe will result in significant improvements in safety and cost savings in health care 
we believe that market acceptance of our products and systems will also depend upon the extent to which physicians  patients and health care payers perceive that the benefits of using our products and systems justify the additional costs and processing requirements 
our products and systems may not gain any significant degree of market acceptance among blood centers  physicians  patients and health care payers  even if clinical trials demonstrate safety and efficacy and necessary regulatory approvals and health care reimbursement approvals are obtained 
if our products and systems fail to achieve market acceptance  we may never become profitable 
a small number of customers will determine market acceptance of our products 
a defined number of blood collection services will dominate the market for the inactine pathogen reduction system for red cells 
in the united states  the american red cross and the america s blood centers collect and distribute the vast majority of the nation s supply of blood and blood components 
major united states blood centers include the new york blood center and the united blood services  each of which distributes approximately percent of the nation s supply of blood and blood components 
in western europe and japan  various national blood transfusion services or red cross organizations collect  store and distribute virtually all of their respective nations blood and blood components supply 
failure to properly market  price or sell our products to any of these large customers could significantly diminish potential product revenue 
we rely on a limited number of suppliers to manufacture our inactivation compound and other components of our inactine pathogen reduction system for red cells 
our inactine system uses a small molecule compound known as pen to inactivate pathogens 
we have a contract with one manufacturer for pen and are currently seeking to qualify additional manufacturers to produce this compound to meet our anticipated commercialization requirements 
if any of these manufacturers  which have not yet been identified  cannot produce and deliver this compound in the required quantities  to the required standards  or in a timely manner we may face delays in the commercialization of the inactine system before we are able to identify alternate or additional manufacturers to meet these requirements 
the procedure for inactivating pathogens using the inactine system requires the use of a cell washing system to remove pen  cell debris and other impurities 
we are currently using a cell washing system manufactured by haemonetics  which we exclusively license from haemonetics pursuant to a development and manufacturing agreement 
when and if our inactine system is commercialized  haemonetics will provide contract manufacturing services for the cell washing equipment and associated disposables 
if haemonetics fails to deliver an adequate supply of the cell washing systems and disposables  we would be required to identify other third party manufacturers 
we may not be able to identify such manufacturers on a timely basis or enter into 
table of contents contracts with such manufacturers on reasonable terms  if at all 
any delay in the availability of the cell washing system and the disposables from haemonetics could delay commercialization and subsequent sales of the inactine system 
furthermore  the inclusion of cell washing systems manufactured by others could require us to seek new approvals from governmental regulatory authorities  which could result in delays in product delivery 
we may not be able to receive any such required regulatory approvals 
if we do not successfully distinguish and commercialize our technology  we may be unable to compete successfully or to generate revenue significant to sustain our operations 
the biotechnology industry  including the fields of transfusion medicine and therapeutic use of blood products  is highly competitive and subject to significant and rapid technological change 
accordingly  our success will depend  in part  on our ability to respond quickly to such change through the development and introduction of new products and systems 
many of our competitors or potential competitors  including our principal competitors cerus corporation and gambro  have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have and may also have greater experience in conducting pre clinical studies  clinical trials and other regulatory approval procedures as well as in marketing their products 
if we or our corporate partners commence commercial product sales  we or our corporate partners will be competing against companies with greater marketing and manufacturing capabilities 
our competitors may obtain patent protection  receive fda approval or commercialize products before we do 
our ability to compete successfully against currently existing and future alternatives to our pathogen reduction technology and competitors who compete directly with us in the pathogen reduction industry will depend  in part  on our ability to attract and retain skilled scientific and research personnel  develop technologically superior products  develop competitively priced products  obtain patent or other required regulatory approvals for our products  be early entrants to the market  and manufacture  market and sell our products  independently or through collaborations 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  we may not be able to operate our business profitably 
our success depends on our ability to develop proprietary products and technologies  to obtain and maintain patents  to protect trade secrets  and to prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights 
we have exclusive patents  licenses to patents and patent applications covering critical components of our technologies 
we also seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes  in part  by confidentiality agreements with our employees and certain contractors 
our patents  pending patent applications and licensed technologies may not afford adequate protection against competitors  and any pending patent applications now or hereafter filed by or licensed to us may not result in patents being issued 
we cannot be certain that our confidentiality agreements will not be breached  that we will have adequate remedies for any breach  or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors 
to the extent that our employees  consultants or contractors use intellectual property owned by others  disputes may arise as to the rights related to or resulting from the know how and inventions 
in addition  the laws of certain non united states countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent  as do the laws of the united states 
medical technology patents involve complex legal and factual questions and  therefore  we cannot predict with certainty their enforceability 

table of contents our patents or patent applications  if issued  may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or may not provide protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology 
furthermore  our competitors may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights for technology similar to ours that could limit our ability to use our technology or commercialize products that we may develop 
litigation may be necessary to assert claims of infringement  to enforce patents issued to us  to protect trade secrets or know how or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
litigation or interference proceedings could result in substantial additional costs and diversion of management focus 
if we are ultimately unable to protect our technology  trade secrets or know how  we may be unable to operate profitably 
if we are unable to operate our business without infringing upon intellectual property rights of others  we may not be able to operate our business profitably 
our success depends on our ability to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others 
we are aware that patents have been applied for and or issued to third parties claiming technologies for decontamination of blood and blood products that may be similar to those needed by us 
we endeavor to follow developments in these fields and we do not believe that our technologies and or products infringe upon any proprietary rights of third parties 
to the extent that planned or potential products turn out to be covered by patents or other intellectual property rights held by third parties  we would need a license under such patents or other intellectual property rights to continue development and marketing of our products 
any required licenses may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we do not obtain such licenses  we may need to design around other parties patents or we may not be able to proceed with the development  manufacture or sale of our products 
litigation may be necessary to defend against claims of infringement or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
litigation or interference proceedings could result in substantial additional costs and diversion of management focus 
if we are ultimately unsuccessful in defending against claims of infringement  we may be unable to operate profitably 
if we lose or are unable to hire and retain qualified personnel  we may not be able to develop our products and technology 
we are highly dependent on the members of our scientific and management staff but have no formal employment agreements with our employees 
although we believe we have been successful in attracting and retaining our employees  we may not be able to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms  if at all  given the competition for such personnel among other companies and research and academic institutions 
if we lose an executive officer or certain key members of our research and development staff or are unable to hire and retain qualified personnel  then our ability to develop and commercialize our products and technology may be hindered 
we have not purchased any key man life insurance 
to date  no executive officer or key employee has notified us of any plans to terminate employment with us 
third party reimbursement policies may adversely affect our ability to commercialize and sell our products and services 
our ability to successfully commercialize our products depends in part on the extent to which appropriate levels of reimbursement for our products and related treatments are obtained from government authorities  private health insurers  third party payers  and other organizations  such as managed care organizations  or mcos 
any failure by doctors  hospitals and other users of our products or systems to obtain appropriate levels of reimbursement could adversely affect our ability to sell these products and systems 
significant uncertainty exists about the reimbursement status of newly approved medical products and services 
reimbursement in the united states or foreign countries may not be available for any of our products  
table of contents reimbursement granted may not be maintained  and limits on reimbursement available from third party payers may reduce the demand for  or negatively affect the price of  our products 
we anticipate that we will need to work with a variety of organizations to lobby government agencies for improved reimbursement policies for our products 
however  we cannot guarantee that such lobbying efforts will take place or that they will ultimately be successful 
we use and generate hazardous materials in our research activities 
defending against any claims relating to the improper handling  storage  release or disposal of these materials could be time consuming and costly 
we are subject to federal  state and local laws  rules  regulations and policies governing the use  generation  manufacture  storage  air emission  effluent discharge  handling and disposal of certain materials  biological specimens and wastes 
there can be no assurance that we will not be required to incur significant costs to comply with environmental and health and safety regulations in the future 
our research and development activities  including development of the inactine pathogen reduction system for red blood cells  involve the controlled use of hazardous materials  including certain hazardous chemicals  viruses and radioactive materials 
although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standard prescribed by state and federal regulations  the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated 
in the event of such an accident  we could be held liable for any damages that result  and any such liability could exceed our insurance limits and our cash resources 
we may face exposure to product liability claims 
we may face exposure to product liability and other claims due to allegations that our products cause harm 
these risks are inherent in our phase iii clinical trials which are currently underway and in the testing  and future manufacturing and marketing of human blood products  including our inactine system 
although we currently maintain product liability insurance  such insurance may not be adequate and we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage in the future at a reasonable cost  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain product liability insurance in the future at an acceptable cost or to otherwise protect against potential product liability claims  we could be inhibited in the commercialization of our products which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
risks related to our stock our stock price is volatile and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid for them 
we first publicly issued common stock on june  at per share in our initial public offering 
between june  and march  the closing sale price has ranged from a high of per share to a low of per share 
the market price of our common stock could continue to fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors  including quarterly fluctuations in results of operations  the announcement of new products or services by us or competitors  changes in or failure to meet earnings estimates by securities analysts  sales of common stock by existing stockholders or the perception that these sales may occur  adverse judgments or settlements obligating us to pay damages  negative publicity  loss of key personnel  developments concerning proprietary rights  including patents and litigation matters  and regulatory developments in both the united states and foreign countries 

table of contents in addition  overall stock market volatility has often significantly affected the market prices of securities for reasons unrelated to a company s operating performance 
in the past  securities class action litigation has been commenced against companies that have experienced periods of volatility in the price of their stock 
securities litigation initiated against us could cause us to incur substantial costs and could lead to the diversion of management s attention and resources  which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and earnings 
we may not be able to comply with the nasdaq national market continued listing requirements 
on november   we received notice from the the nasdaq stock market  inc nasdaq that our common stock had failed to maintain the minimum bid price closing requirement of for consecutive trading days required to maintain continued listing on the nasdaq national market 
the letter specified that  unless our common stock closes at a minimum bid price of or more for ten consecutive days by february   nasdaq would notify us at that time of its intent to delist the stock 
the letter also stated that we could appeal any delisting notification received at that time 
on january   the nasdaq board of directors voted to modify its rules for continued listing to provide an extension of the grace period for compliance with the minimum bid price 
the proposed new rules were approved by the sec on march  on march   we received a letter from nasdaq indicating that we now have until may  to regain compliance with the requirements for continued listing on the nasdaq national market 
if our closing bid price remains below  our board of directors will consider effecting a reverse stock split 
the november  letter also indicated that we have fallen below the requirement that the market value of our publicly held shares be at least million 
on november   we sent a letter to nasdaq disputing their contention that we were not in compliance with their market value requirement 
although we have had no formal response to this letter since that date  the march  letter indicates that nasdaq no longer contends that the market value of our publicly held shares is below million 
delisting could have an adverse effect on our price and trading volume  and stockholders might find it more difficult to dispose of their shares of our common stock 
the sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could cause the market price of our common stock to decline and may impair our ability to raise capital through additional offerings 
our executive officers  directors and holders of more than of our common stock collectively beneficially own approximately of the outstanding common stock as of march  in addition  if we receive commitments from any of these stockholders to acquire shares of our common stock in the proposed rights offering  that ownership percentage could substantially increase 
the million shares of our common stock offered for sale in the proposed rights offering will be immediately freely tradable without restriction under the securities act of  as amended the securities act  except for any shares purchased by an affiliate of ours as that term is defined under the rules and regulations of the securities act  which will be subject to the resale limitations of rule under the securities act 
in addition  approximately  shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of vested stock options could become available for immediate resale if such options were exercised 
sale  or the availability for sale  of shares of common stock by stockholders could cause the market price of our common stock to decline and could impair our ability to raise capital through an offering of additional equity securities 
our largest stockholder  ampersand ventures  owns sufficient shares of our common stock to significantly affect the results of any stockholder vote 
our largest stockholder  ampersand ventures  beneficially owns or controls approximately of our common stock as of march  and could increase its percentage ownership of our common stock as a result of its participation in our proposed rights offering 
ampersand ventures including its affiliates  has expressed interest in the purchase of up to  shares in this offering 
under certain conditions  ampersand could own directly and indirectly up to of our outstanding shares following the closing of the offering 
certain matters which  under our restated certificate of incorporation  require a vote by the stockholders for approval may be delayed or blocked by ampersand ventures  either alone or in collaboration with any other or more stockholder 
these matters include the election of the board of directors  
table of contents amendments to our organizational documents  or approval of any merger  sale of assets or other major corporate transaction 
in addition  our executive officers and directors  including those directors representing ampersand ventures  beneficially own approximately of our common stock as of march   which percentage could also increase as a result of participation by such stockholders and their affiliates in the proposed rights offering 
as a result  these executive officers and directors as a group have the ability to significantly influence the outcome of matters requiring a stockholder vote 
anti takeover provisions may frustrate attempts to replace our current management and discourage investors from buying our common stock 
certain provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation and restated by laws in effect as of march   as well as the delaware general corporation law the dgcl  reduce the power of stockholders generally  even those with a majority of the voting power in our company  to remove incumbent directors and to fill vacancies on the board of directors without the support of the incumbent directors 
in addition  our restated certificate of incorporation and restated by laws provide that stockholder action may not be effected without a duly called meeting 
our restated certificate of incorporation and restated by laws also do not permit our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders 
this effectively limits the ability of our stockholders to conduct any form of consent solicitation 
provisions of the dgcl  our restated certificate of incorporation and restated by laws could discourage a third party from attempting to acquire  or make it more difficult for a third party to acquire  control of our company without approval of our board of directors  even if such acquisition were beneficial to other stockholders 
moreover  the provisions of the dgcl and our restated certificate of incorporation and restated by laws relating to the removal of directors and the filling of vacancies on the board of directors preclude a third party from removing incumbent directors without cause and simultaneously gaining control of the board of directors by filling  with its own nominees  the vacancies created by removal 
such provisions could also limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of the common stock 
such provisions also allow the board of directors to authorize the issuance of preferred stock with rights superior to those of the common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to the effects of changes in interest rates on our investments of available cash balances in money market funds and in portfolios of investment grade corporate and us government securities and on our borrowings under the pall revolving credit facility 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes
