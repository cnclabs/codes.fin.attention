item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discusses the company s restatement of financial information  critical accounting policies and reviews the results of segment operating results  consolidated investments  the company s liquidity and capital resources  and current debt and financial strength ratings of the company and its insurance subsidiaries 
restatement of financial information during and  the company recorded other than temporary impairments on certain of its fixed maturity securities based on values that included their quoted market prices  as well as to give effect to analysis by the company with respect to certain issuers of securities that perhaps was not reflected in those market prices 
after discussions with the staff of the securities and exchange commission s division of corporation finance  the company has concluded that not relying solely on quoted market prices for its other than temporary impairment charges was an erroneous interpretation of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and  accordingly  is restating its previously issued financial statements for the years ended december  and to adjust the amounts recorded during and on these securities such that the other than temporary impairments are based on the then quoted market prices 
the non cash adjustments did not impact the company s total stockholders equity in any period because the company had already recorded the unrealized effect of the decreased market value of its fixed maturity securities through stockholders equity in the appropriate periods 
the effect of these restatements increased net income million in and decreased net income million and million in and additional detail is presented below and in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements contained herein in item in millions of dollars  except share data as reported net realized investment losses total revenue income before tax  extraordinary loss  and cumulative effect of accounting principle change federal income tax income before extraordinary loss and cumulative effect of accounting principle change net income net income per common share basic assuming dilution stockholders equity as restated net realized investment losses total revenue income before tax  extraordinary loss  and cumulative effect of accounting principle change federal income tax income before extraordinary loss and cumulative effect of accounting principle change net income net income per common share basic assuming dilution stockholders equity 
table of contents critical accounting policies reserves for policy and contract benefits the two primary categories of liabilities for policy and contract benefits are policy reserves for claims not yet incurred and claim reserves for claims that have been incurred and have future benefits to be paid 
policy reserves equal the present value of the difference between future policy benefits and expenses and future premiums  allowing a margin for profit 
these reserves are applicable for the majority of the company s business  which is traditional non interest sensitive in nature 
the claim payments are estimated using assumptions established when the policy was issued 
ordinarily  generally accepted accounting principles require that these assumptions not be subsequently modified unless the policy reserves are determined to be inadequate 
throughout the life of the policy  the reserve is based on the original assumptions used for the policy s issue year 
a claim reserve is established when a claim is incurred or is estimated to have been incurred but not yet reported to the company 
policy reserves for a particular policy continue to be maintained after a claim reserve has been established for as long as the policy remains in force 
claim reserves generally equal the company s estimate  at the current reporting period  of the present value of the liability for future benefits and expenses to be paid on a claim 
a claim reserve for a specific claim is based on assumptions derived from the company s actual historical experience as to claim duration as well as the specific characteristics of the claimant such as benefits available under the policy  the covered benefit period  and the age and occupation of the claimant 
consideration is given to historical trends in the company s experience and to expected deviations from historical experience that result from changes in benefits available  changes in the company s risk management policies and procedures  and other economic  environmental  or societal factors 
reserves for claims that are estimated to have already been incurred but that have not yet been reported to the company are based on factors such as historical claim reporting patterns  the average cost of claims  and the expected volumes of incurred claims 
claim reserves  unlike policy reserves  are subject to revision as current claim experience and projections of future factors affecting claim experience change 
in a reporting period  actual experience may deviate from the long term assumptions used to determine the claim reserves 
the company reviews annually  or more frequently as appropriate  emerging experience to ensure that its claim reserves make adequate and reasonable provision for future benefits and expenses 
this review includes the determination of a range of reasonable estimates within which the reserve must fall 
the company s reserves for group and individual disability products include a provision for future payments other than legal expenses on all lawsuits for which the cause of action has already occurred 
this includes known lawsuits and those yet to be filed 
the reserve amount is the company s estimate of the payments on all such lawsuits based on past payments and expected future payments 
deferred policy acquisition costs the company defers certain costs incurred in acquiring new business and amortizes expenses these costs over the life of the related policies 
deferred costs include commissions  other agency compensation  certain selection and policy issue expenses  and certain field expenses 
acquisition costs that do not vary with the production of new business  such as commissions on group products which are generally level throughout the life of the policy  are excluded from deferral 
the company uses its own historical experience and expectation of the future performance of its business in determining the expected life of the policies 
approximately percent of the company s deferred policy acquisition costs relate to traditional non interest sensitive products  for which the costs are amortized in proportion to the estimated premium income to be received over the life of the policies 
the estimated premium income in the early years of the amortization period is higher than in the later years due to higher anticipated policy persistency in the early years  which results in a greater proportion of the costs being amortized in the early years of the life of the policy 
amortization of deferred costs on traditional products is adjusted to reflect the actual policy persistency as compared to the anticipated experience 
the company will experience accelerated amortization if policies terminate earlier than projected 
deferred costs related to group and individual disability products are amortized over a twenty year period 
for costs deferred in  approximately percent and percent of the original deferred costs related to group disability products are expected to be amortized by years ten and fifteen  respectively 
for individual disability policies  approximately percent and percent of the original deferred costs are expected to be amortized by years ten and fifteen  respectively 
deferred costs for group life products are amortized over a fifteen year period  with approximately percent of the cost expected to be amortized by year ten 
deferred costs for group and individual long term care 
table of contents products are amortized over a twenty year period  with approximately percent and percent of the original deferred costs expected to be amortized by years ten and fifteen  respectively 
for costs deferred in  the period of amortization has not changed from the period used for costs deferred in previous years  but the expected proportion of costs amortized in the early years of the life of the policy has been accelerated due to recent company experience relative to persistency 
valuation of fixed maturity securities in determining when a decline in fair value below amortized cost of a fixed maturity security is other than temporary  the company evaluates the following factors the significance of the decline in value 
the time period during which there has been a significant decline in value 
whether the security is current as to principal and interest payments 
the probability of recovering principal and interest 
the company s ability and intent to retain the security for a sufficient period of time for it to recover 
market conditions 
relevant industry conditions and trends relative to their historical cycles 
rating agency actions 
bid and offering prices and the level of trading activity 
current and future business prospects and trends of earnings 
any other key measures for the related security 
the company s review procedures include  but are not limited to  biweekly meetings of certain members of the company s senior management personnel to review reports on the entire portfolio  identifying investments with changes in market value of five percent or more  investments with changes in rating either by external rating agencies or internal analysts  investments segmented by issuer  industry  and foreign exposure levels  and any other relevant investment information to help identify the company s exposure to possible credit losses 
based on this review of the entire investment portfolio  individual investments may be added to or removed from the company s watch list  which is a list of securities subject to enhanced monitoring and a more intensive review 
the company also determines if its investment portfolio is overexposed to an issuer that is showing warning signs of deterioration and  if so  the company makes no further purchases of that issuer s securities and may seek opportunities to sell securities it holds from that issuer to reduce the company s exposure 
the company monitors below investment grade securities as to individual exposures and in comparison to the entire portfolio as an additional credit risk management strategy  looking specifically at the company s exposure to individual securities currently classified as below investment grade 
if the company determines that the decline in value of an investment is other than temporary  the investment is written down to fair value  and an impairment loss is recognized in the current period to the extent of the decline in value 
if the decline is considered temporary  the security continues to be carefully monitored 
these controls have been established to identify the company s exposure to possible credit losses and are intended to give the company the ability to respond rapidly 
the company has no held to maturity fixed maturity securities 
all fixed maturity securities are classified as available for sale and are reported at fair value 
fair values are based on quoted market prices  where available 
private placement fixed maturity securities with a carrying value of approximately billion  or percent of total fixed maturity securities at december   do not have readily determinable market prices 
for these securities  the company uses internally prepared valuations combining matrix pricing with vendor purchased software programs  including valuations based on estimates of future profitability  to estimate the fair value 
additionally  the company obtains prices from independent third party brokers to establish valuations for certain of these securities 
all such investments are classified as available for sale 
the company s ability to liquidate its positions in some of these securities could be impacted to a significant degree by the lack of an actively traded market  and the company may not be able to dispose of these investments in a timely manner 
although the company believes its estimates reasonably reflect the fair value of those securities  the key assumptions about the risk free interest rates  risk premiums  performance of underlying collateral if any  and other factors involve significant assumptions and may not reflect those of an active market 
the company 
table of contents believes that generally these private placement securities carry a credit quality comparable to companies rated baa or bbb by major credit rating organizations 
as of december   the key assumptions used to estimate the fair value of private placement fixed maturity securities included the following risk free interest rates of percent for five year maturities to percent for year maturities were derived from the current yield curve for us treasury bonds with similar maturities 
current baa corporate bond spreads ranging from percent to percent plus an additional basis points were added to the risk free rate to consider the lack of liquidity 
an additional five basis points were added to the risk free rates for foreign investments 
additional basis points were added as deemed appropriate for certain industries and for individual securities in certain industries that are considered to be of greater risk 
increasing the basis points added to the risk free rate for lack of liquidity by basis points  increasing the five basis points added to the risk free rates for foreign investments by one basis point  and increasing the additional basis points added to each industry considered to be of greater risk by one basis point would have decreased the december  net unrealized gain in the fixed maturity securities portfolio by approximately million 
historically  the company s realized gains or losses on dispositions of its private placement fixed maturity securities have not varied significantly from amounts estimated under the valuation methodology described above 
changes in the fair value of fixed maturity securities  other than declines that are determined to be other than temporary  are reported as a component of other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
if it is subsequently determined that any of these securities are other than temporarily impaired  the impairment loss is reported as a realized investment loss in the consolidated statements of income 
the recognition of the impairment loss does not affect total stockholders equity to the extent that the decline in value had been previously reflected in other comprehensive income 
there are a number of significant risks inherent in the process of monitoring the company s fixed maturity securities for impairments and determining when and if an impairment is other than temporary 
these risks and uncertainties include the following possibilities the assessment of a borrower s ability to meet its contractual obligations will change 
the economic outlook  either domestic or foreign  may be less favorable or may have a more significant impact on the borrower than anticipated  and as such  the security may not recover in value 
new information may become available concerning the security  such as disclosure of accounting irregularities  fraud  or corporate governance issues 
significant changes in credit spreads may occur in the related industry 
adverse rating agency actions may occur 
reinsurance receivable reinsurance is a contractual agreement whereby the company s reinsurance partners assume a defined portion of the risk for future benefits payable under reinsurance contracts 
the reinsurance receivable reported as an asset in the company s consolidated statements of financial condition includes amounts due from the company s reinsurers on current claims and estimates of amounts that will be due on future claims 
policy reserves and claim reserves reported in the company s consolidated statements of financial condition are not reduced for reinsurance 
the reinsurance receivable is generally equal to the policy reserves and claim reserves related to the risk being reinsured 
the company reduces the reinsurance receivable if recovery is not likely due to the financial position of the reinsurer or if there is disagreement between the company and the reinsurer regarding the liability of the reinsurer 
results of operations this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained herein in
