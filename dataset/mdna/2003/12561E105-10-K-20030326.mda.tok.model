item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
financial information about industry segments we are engaged in the development  operation and franchising of quick service and fast casual restaurants  primarily under the brand names carl s jr  hardee s  and la salsa  principally in the united states of america 
information about our revenues  operating profits and assets is contained in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
our strategies as shown in the segment quarterly net income loss table above  as well as the information contained in the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  carl s jr 
operates profitably while hardee s operates at a loss 
in viewing the segments  we allocate much of our general and administrative expenses and all of our interest to each of the segments 
on that basis  hardee s has been operating at a loss  excluding facility action charges  of approximately  per month during the last fiscal year 
revitalizing hardee s remains the primary focus for our management team 
our success will depend on the successful execution of our strategy  which includes maintaining the profitability of the carl s jr 
brand  continuing to focus on premium  rather than discounted  products  continuing to focus on cost controls  remodeling the hardee s restaurants  growing the la salsa brand  leveraging dual brand opportunities with green burrito  successfully implementing the recently announced plan to distinguish hardee s as a premium burger restaurant  and addressing the maturity of our million of convertible notes which mature in march and our credit facility which matures in december see item management s discussion and analysis of the results of operations below 
the key success factor in operating hardee s profitably is increasing sales 
at the end of the fiscal year  the average unit volume auv at our company owned hardee s restaurants was approximately  while franchise operated auv was we estimate that for the concept to operate profitably  the auv must be in the range of to we can provide no assurance that we will be successful in improving hardee s auv s to those levels 
narrative description of business carl s jr 
concept 
carl s jr 
restaurants offer superior food quality  a diverse menu  premium dining selections at reasonable prices  and attentive customer service to create a quality dining experience for its customers 
we believe that these features differentiate carl s jr 
from its competitors and are critical to its success 
the menu at carl s jr 
features freshly prepared food items that appeal to a broad audience 
we generally make carl s jr 
charbroiled hamburgers  chicken sandwiches and signature items at the time of the customer s order  applying exacting quality standards and offering them in generous portions 
by providing partial table service  unlimited drink refills and an attractive restaurant decor  carl s jr 
restaurants offer a pleasant  customer friendly environment 
we believe that our focus on our customers and customer service  superior food quality and generous portions enables carl s jr 
restaurants to maintain a strong price value image with customers that has met with relative success 
our carl s jr 
auv s were  for the trailing twelve months ended january  cke restaurants  inc 

table of contents menu and restaurant design 
carl s jr 
restaurants offer a variety of products that have a strong reputation for quality and taste 
the carl s jr 
menu is relatively uniform throughout the chain and features several charbroiled hamburgers and chicken sandwiches  including the six dollar burger  famous star  western bacon cheeseburger  super star  charbroiler chicken sandwich  chili burger  crispy chicken sandwich  the sourdough bacon cheeseburger and the spicy chicken sandwich 
we also offer a fish sandwich  stuffed baked potatoes  prepackaged salads  french fries  chili fries  onion rings and fried zucchini 
most carl s jr 
restaurants also have a breakfast menu including french toast dips  sunrise sandwich  croissant sunrise sandwich and a breakfast burrito 
in addition  the restaurants sell a variety of promotional products on a limited basis 
most carl s jr 
restaurants are freestanding  ranging in size from  to  square feet  with a seating capacity of to persons and drive thru facilities 
some restaurants are located in shopping malls and other in line facilities 
currently  several building designs and floorplans are in use system wide  depending upon operational needs  local zoning requirements and real estate availability 
substantially all of our carl s jr 
restaurants have bright colored exteriors  red awnings and a large  tilted happy star logo 
the interiors feature the same bright colors  food murals  display cases for salads and desserts and accent lighting throughout the dining area 
we believe that carl s jr 
s restaurant design further increases consumer awareness of the carl s jr 
brand 
we recently introduced a new prototype building marking a significant shift in the design of carl s jr 
restaurants 
the design was conceived to improve the drive thru experience and features dynamic lighting  extensive landscaping  and a fluid traffic flow 
the interior of the restaurant has an open  contemporary look 
we believe the new building design signifies that carl s jr 
is not a typical fast food restaurant 
dual branding 
dual branding allows a single restaurant to offer consumers two distinct brand menus 
in may  we entered into an agreement with green burrito  the predecessor of sbrg  to offer the green burrito menu at selected carl s jr 
locations 
we believe green burrito s position in the popular mexican food segment and its dinner menu orientation complement the carl s jr 
menu 
customers of the carl s jr 
green burrito dual brand restaurants are able to order items from both menu boards located at the same counter 
both menus are also available to customers utilizing the drive thru 
the green burrito menu offered at the dual brand restaurants features a wide variety of traditional mexican food items  including burritos  enchiladas  tacos  taquitos and nachos  as well as combination meals which are served with rice and beans 
a variety of condiments such as jalapeno peppers  hot sauce and mild and hot salsa are available at self serve salsa bars so that customers can spice and garnish their meals according to individual taste 
in order to convert an existing carl s jr 
restaurant to a dual brand carl s jr 
green burrito restaurant  the additional equipment necessary to offer the green burrito menu is added to the carl s jr 
restaurant  as well as new menu boards and new signage  both inside and outside  indicating the offering of both brands 
in most cases  changes to the seating area or other parts of the physical structure of the restaurant are unnecessary 
we believe that this dual branding program has attracted new customers  while increasing the frequency of customer visits at converted restaurants 
our dual branded carl s jr 
green burrito restaurants have the highest average unit volumes in the system  at  for the trailing twelve months ended january  in general  the cost to convert an existing carl s jr 
restaurant to a dual brand carl s jr 
green burrito restaurant is approximately on march   we acquired sbrg  which owns the green burrito brand 
this acquisition provided us with control of the menu and of the ability to develop the brand  and eliminated our franchise fee and royalty expense 
we receive a franchise fee for each franchise conversion and royalties from our franchisees green burrito food sales 
as of january   carl s jr 
company operated locations have been converted to carl s jr 
green burrito dual concept restaurants 
as of january   franchised carl s jr 
restaurants have been converted to the carl s jr 
green burrito concept 
hardee s concept 
hardee s has a market presence in the southeastern and midwestern united states 
the hardee s restaurant chain offers a variety of menu items  including breakfast and certain made to order lunch and dinner offerings including charbroiled hamburgers in those restaurants that have been remodeled 
currently  hardee s is changing its focus from discount  variety products to premium products  such as the six dollar burger and premium angus beef thickburgers 
cke restaurants  inc 

table of contents menu and restaurant design 
hardee s restaurants currently offer primarily hamburgers and chicken sandwiches 
a significant portion of hardee s day part is breakfast 
breakfast generates approximately of hardee s overall operating revenue 
hardee s breakfast menu features made from scratch biscuits  biscuit breakfast sandwiches and other items such as hash rounds and breakfast platters 
substantially all of hardee s restaurants have drive thru facilities  and selected restaurants are open hours a day  primarily on the weekends 
most hardee s restaurants are freestanding  ranging in size from  to  square feet  with a seating capacity of to persons 
currently  several building designs and floor plans are in use system wide  depending upon operational needs  local zoning requirements and real estate availability 
since our acquisition of hardee s  we introduced certain made to order lunch and dinner menu items that are currently served in our carl s jr 
restaurants  such as the six dollar burger  chicken breast strips and other signature products from carl s jr 
we recently introduced a line of premium pound  pound  and pound thickburgers in certain hardee s markets 
we expect to offer thickburgers at all of our hardee s restaurants within the next several months 
we have implemented the carl s jr 
style limited table service and added all you can drink beverage bars in all of our company operated hardee s restaurants  and some of our franchise restaurants 
we expect to implement these changes at all franchised hardee s by the third quarter of fiscal additionally  we are remodeling our hardee s restaurants to the star hardee s format  which we designed to update and revitalize the hardee s brand with the menu and operating qualities of carl s jr 
a star hardee s remodel involves installing charbroilers in the kitchens  remodeling the interior and exterior of the restaurant and installing new signage that accents the hardee s name with a star logo 
over the past year  we  along with some franchisees  have been able to revise the remodel  and thus have been able to significantly reduce the cost 
we believe that the revised remodels offer consumers the same quality dining experience as the original star hardee s conversion 
as of january   we had remodeled  or approximately  of our company operated hardee s restaurants 
the approximate cost to remodel a restaurant to the star hardee s format is approximately la salsa fresh mexican grill concept 
la salsa restaurants are located primarily in california 
la salsa restaurants are quality  fast casual restaurants featuring traditional mexican food items 
the restaurants  modeled after taquerias of mexico  primarily cater to the lunch and dinner segment and feature freshly prepared items 
menu and restaurant design 
la salsa restaurants emphasize generous portions and quality ingredients including grade a skinless chicken  usda lean steak  mahi mahi  shrimp  real cheddar and monterey jack cheese  long grain rice and both black and pinto beans 
all ingredients are prepared fresh as there are no can openers or microwave ovens in the restaurants 
food is prepared to order  so that each item served will be fresh and hot 
the restaurants also offer a self service salsa bar featuring a variety of condiments and freshly made salsas 
most la salsa restaurants are in line  ranging in size from  to  square feet with a seating capacity of to persons 
currently  several floor plans are in use system wide  depending on operational needs  local zoning requirements and real estate availability 
investments in other restaurant concepts in the past  we have invested in other restaurant concepts  as described below see also note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
rally s and checkers 
through a series of transactions  the company had an investment in checkers drive in restaurants  inc checkers 
checkers operates and franchises approximately checkers and rally s double drive thru quick service hamburger restaurants  primarily in the southeastern and midwestern united states 
through fiscal  we accounted for our investment in checkers under the equity method of accounting  as our chairman of the board was the chairman of checkers 
our chairman is no longer a member of the board of directors of checkers 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we wrote down our investment in checkers by  to its fair market value upon our evaluation that the investment had experienced an other than temporary decline in value 
further  as a result of recognizing our share of the net losses of checkers  our investment in checkers was zero as of january  during fiscal and  we sold  and  shares of checkers stock  respectively  and generated net proceeds of  and  respectively

we held a minority interest in boston west  llc boston west  which operated boston market restaurants in designated markets in southern california as a franchise area developer of boston chicken  inc bci  the franchisor of the boston market restaurant concept 
bci and its subsidiaries filed for protection under chapter of the federal bankruptcy code on october  in a separate action  on november   boston west filed a voluntary petition under chapter of the federal bankruptcy code in order to restructure its overall operations

taco bueno 
on june   we sold the taco bueno concept 
the net proceeds from the sale were approximately million and were used to permanently reduce our bank debt see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
santa barbara restaurant group 
on march   we acquired santa barbara restaurant group  inc and its la salsa  green burrito and timber lodge steakhouse restaurant brands see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
because the timber lodge brand does not fit our core concept of fast casual restaurants  it is classified as an asset held for sale as of january  an independent committee of members of the board of directors engaged an investment banking firm roth capital partners to solicit bids to acquire timber lodge steakhouse 
although we have no present intention to acquire additional interests in other restaurant concepts  we may do so in the future depending on the business prospects of the restaurant concept  the availability of financing at attractive terms  alternative business opportunities available to us  the consent of our senior lenders  if required  and general economic conditions 
restaurant development we perform extensive due diligence for new restaurant site selections before we commit to opening  or permitting a franchise to open  a restaurant at a location 
we intend to continue to open new company operated restaurants primarily in established markets 
in fiscal  we developed nine new restaurants  and our franchisees and licensees developed new restaurants 
the average development cost  including capitalizing ground and equipment leases at  for owned restaurants was as follows average per restaurant carl s jr 
hardee s la salsa land building equipment total the averages above are contingent upon a number of factors including  but not limited to  store prototype  geographical area  and local zoning requirements 
franchising carl s jr 
our franchise strategy is designed to further the development of the carl s jr 
chain and reduce the total capital we need to develop new carl s jr 
restaurants 
franchise arrangements with carl s jr 
franchisees  which operate in alaska  arizona  california  colorado  hawaii  idaho  nevada  new mexico  oklahoma  oregon  texas  utah and washington  generally provide for initial fees and continuing royalty payments and advertising fees to us based upon a percentage of gross sales generally for royalties and to for advertising

table of contents program  and specific net worth and liquidity requirements must be satisfied 
in addition  area development agreements generally require franchisees to open a specified number of carl s jr 
restaurants in a designated geographic area within a specified time period 
the majority of our carl s jr 
franchisees own more than one restaurant  with franchisees owning seven or more restaurants 
we presently anticipate that our carl s jr 
franchisees and licensees will open approximately new carl s jr 
restaurants during fiscal hardee s 
franchise agreements with hardee s franchisees  who operate restaurants in the southeastern and midwestern united states  generally provide for initial fees and continuing royalty payments to us based upon a percentage of gross sales generally for royalties and for advertising

in addition  most franchisees are required to purchase and install all fixtures  furnishings  signs and equipment specified in the approved site layout and plan 
prior to the opening of a franchised restaurant  the general manager of each franchise is required to attend and complete hardee s company sponsored training program 
franchisees may also be required to remit lease payments for the use of our company owned or leased restaurant facilities and to pay related occupancy costs 
as of january   our hardee s franchisees and licensees operated  hardee s restaurants  approximately of the system 
our franchising and licensing operations are premised on the active involvement of franchisees in restaurant management and operations 
candidates are reviewed for appropriate operational experience and financial stability  including specific net worth and liquidity requirements 
generally  area development agreements require franchisees to open a specified number of restaurants in a designated geographic area within a specified period of time 
at hardee s  average unit volumes for our international licensed restaurants were in fiscal and total sales at hardee s international restaurants exceeded  since our acquisition of hardee s  we have worked to develop and enhance a productive relationship with our hardee s franchisees

as of january   franchisees and licensees operated  hardee s restaurants 
the majority of our hardee s franchisees own more than one restaurant  with franchisees owning or more restaurants 
restaurant operations and support we strive to maintain high standards in all products and equipment used by our restaurants  as well as our operations related to food preparation  service and cleanliness 
we generally prepare our hamburgers and chicken sandwiches after the customer has placed an order with the goal of serving them promptly 
in addition  we charbroil hamburger patties and chicken breasts in a gas fired double broiler that sears the meat on both sides in a uniform heating and cooking time 
at our hardee s restaurants  we have focused on the fundamentals of restaurant operations quality  service and cleanliness 
we believe our renewed focus on these factors  as well as our ongoing remodel program  which includes the installation of gas fired charbroilers  are necessary for improved restaurant operations 
at our la salsa restaurants  we prepare our fresh mex menu items after the customer has placed an order with the goal of serving them promptly 
our commitment to quality in both our products and our operations is supported by our training program 
each company operated restaurant is operated by a general manager who has received a minimum of nine weeks of management training

purchasing we purchase most of the food products and packaging supplies used in our carl s jr 
restaurant system and warehouse and distribute such items to both company operated and franchised carl s jr 
restaurants 
although not required to do so  our carl s jr 
franchisees in california and some adjacent states purchase most of their food  packaging and supplies from us 
we have elected not to outsource all of our distribution activities because we believe our mature procurement process allows us to effectively manage our food costs  provide adequate quantities of food and supplies at competitive prices  and generate revenue from carl s jr 
franchisees by adding a nominal mark up to cover direct costs and provide better overall service to our restaurants in california 
we seek competitive bids from suppliers on many of our products  approve suppliers of those products and require them to adhere to our established product specifications 
we currently purchase substantially all of the food  packaging and supplies sold or used in our hardee s restaurants from mbm corporation mbm 
mbm currently distributes products to company operated restaurants and to many of the hardee s restaurants operated by our franchisees 
pursuant to the terms of our recently completed distribution agreements  we are obligated to purchase substantially all of our specified product requirements from mbm for a remaining term of seven years 
the prices we pay for mbm products  and the delivery fees we pay  are subject to adjustment in certain circumstances  which may include increases or decreases resulting from changes in the distributor s cost structure 
we purchase most of the food  packaging and supplies used in our la salsa restaurants from mccabe s quality foods 
we have distribution agreements with both mccabe s quality foods  who services restaurants in california  nevada and arizona  and sysco  who distributes to our outer market franchise restaurants 
the agreements with mccabe s and sysco expire in fiscal and  respectively 
competition and markets the restaurant business is intensely competitive and affected by changes in a geographic area  changes in the public s eating habits and preferences  local and national economic conditions affecting consumer spending habits  population trends and local traffic patterns 
key elements of competition in the industry are the price  quality and value of food products offered  quality and speed of service  advertising effectiveness  brand name identification  restaurant locations and attractiveness of facilities 
we primarily compete with major restaurant chains  some of whom dominate the qsr industry  and also compete with a variety of other take out foodservice companies and fast food restaurants 
our competitors also include a variety of mid price  full service casual dining restaurants  health and nutrition oriented restaurants  delicatessens and prepared food restaurants  as well as supermarkets and convenience stores

table of contents government regulation each company operated and franchised restaurant must comply with regulations adopted by federal agencies and with licensing and other regulations enforced by state and local health  sanitation  safety  fire and other departments 
in addition  these restaurants must comply with federal and state environmental regulations  but those regulations have not had a material effect on the restaurants operations 
stringent and varied requirements of local governmental bodies with respect to zoning  land use and environmental factors can delay and sometimes prevent development of new restaurants and remodeling of existing restaurants in particular locations 
we are also subject to federal laws and a substantial number of state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises 
such laws impose registration and disclosure requirements on franchisors in the offer and sale of franchises and may include substantive standards regarding the relationship between franchisor and franchisee  including limitations on the ability of franchisors to terminate franchise agreements or otherwise alter franchise arrangements 
we believe we are operating in substantial compliance with applicable laws and regulations governing our franchise operations 
we  and our franchisees  must comply with the fair labor standards act and various federal and state laws governing employment matters  such as minimum wages  overtime pay practices  child labor laws and other working conditions and citizenship requirements 
many of our employees are paid hourly rates related to the federal and state minimum wage laws and  accordingly  increases in the minimum wage increase our labor costs 
the company monitors its facilities for compliance with the americans with disabilities act ada in order to conform to its requirements 
under the ada  the company could be required to expend funds to modify its restaurants to better provide service to  or make reasonable accommodation for the employment of  disabled persons 
we believe that such expenditures  if required  would not have a material adverse effect on the company s operations 
environmental matters we are subject to various federal  state and local environmental laws 
these laws govern discharges to air and water from our restaurants  as well as handling and disposal practices for solid and hazardous wastes 
these laws may impose liability for damages from and the costs of cleaning up sites of spills  disposals or other releases of hazardous materials 
we may be responsible for environmental conditions relating to our restaurants and the land on which our restaurants are located  regardless of whether we lease or own the restaurants or land in question and regardless of whether such environmental conditions were created by us or by a prior owner or tenant 
we cannot provide assurance that all such environmental conditions have been identified by us 
these conditions include the presence of asbestos containing materials  leaking underground storage tanks and on site spills 
further  certain properties formerly had landfills  historic industrial use  gasoline stations and or dry cleaning businesses located on or near the premises 
corrective action  as required by the regulatory agencies  has been undertaken at some of the sites  although the majority of these sites are being remediated by former landowners or tenants 
the enforcement of our rights against third parties for environmental conditions  such as off site sources of contamination  may result in additional transaction costs for us 
seasonality we operate on a retail accounting calendar 
our fiscal year has four week accounting periods and ends the last monday in january 
the first quarter of our fiscal year has four periods  or weeks 
all other quarters have three periods  or weeks 
our restaurant sales  and therefore our profitability  are subject to seasonal fluctuations and are traditionally higher during the spring and summer months because of factors such as increased travel and better weather conditions  which affect the public s dining habits 
government contracts no material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the us government

risk factors we are engaged in a business turnaround 
the success of a business turnaround  by its very nature  involves a significant number of risks  many of which are discussed below our ability to pursue new business opportunities  remodel older restaurants and open new restaurants  which are necessary in order to remain competitive and grow  may be impacted by the fact that we are a highly leveraged company 
as of the end of the fiscal year  our outstanding indebtedness  including capital leases  was  our debt level may restrict the pursuit of new opportunities such as business acquisitions 
our substantial indebtedness requires us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness  which may prevent us from pursuing plans to open new restaurants and make other capital expenditures necessary to remain competitive in the qsr segment 
for instance  the principal measure of success in the qsr segment is same store sales 
remodeling older restaurants is an effective way to stimulate sales 
if we are required to divert cash flow to repayment of debt from the remodeling of older restaurants  as well as opening new restaurants  our future profitability would be adversely affected 
failure to maintain certain financial ratios could cause us to violate the terms of our credit facility and thereby result in acceleration of our indebtedness  impair our liquidity and limit our ability to operate 
our failure to make required debt payments could result in an acceleration of our indebtedness  in which case the lenders would be entitled to exercise their remedies 
our highly leveraged status may prevent us from accessing credit or equity markets at favorable terms to address future financing needs 
the lack of availability of financing may prevent us from implementing growth plans or proceeding with operational improvement initiatives  which may place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors and increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions 
additionally  because we are highly leveraged  it may be more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our outstanding public debt  senior credit facility and other indebtedness 
our future success may be affected by our ability to revitalize hardee s 
we have been challenged in our efforts to reestablish the connection between hardee s and consumers 
our efforts have included new marketing strategies  remodeling restaurants  refranchising restaurants  product variety  use of discounting and a focus on the fundamentals quality  service and cleanliness 
hardee s is an under performing brand 
failure to revitalize the brand may have a significant negative effect on our success 
our success may be dependent on our franchisees participation in our strategy 
our franchisees are an integral part of our business 
we may be unable to successfully implement our brand strategies if our franchisees do not participate in that implementation 
a failure by our franchisees to focus on the fundamentals of restaurant operations quality  service and cleanliness may have a negative impact on our success 
our financial results may be affected by our franchisees 
we receive revenue from our franchisees 
our financial results are somewhat contingent upon the operational and financial success of our franchisees  including implementation of our strategic plans  as well as their ability to secure adequate financing 
if sales trends economic conditions worsen for our franchisees  their financial health may worsen  our collection rates may decline and we may be required to assume the responsibility for additional lease payments on franchised restaurants 
additionally  refusal on the part of franchisees to renew their franchise agreements may result in decreased revenues 
entering into restructured franchise agreements may result in reduced franchise royalty rates in the future 
our business may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions and increased operating costs that may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
when the american consumer has more to spend  restaurant trends are  in general  positively impacted 
the qsr segment has historically attracted consumers that are either lower income and or pressed for time 
due to the low average check  the qsr segment is relatively recession resistant 
however  if the national trend were to be a severe economic downturn  the resulting impact on our customers disposable incomes would have a negative impact on our sales 
our profitability could also be negatively impacted if we face increased costs for food  fuel  utilities  wages  clothing and equipment  that we are unable to recover through price increases 
cke restaurants  inc 

table of contents unfavorable trends or developments concerning factors such as inflation  increased food  labor and employee benefit costs including increases in hourly wage and unemployment tax rates  increases in the number of locations of competing quick service restaurants  regional weather conditions and the availability of experienced management and hourly employees may also adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our business depends on our ability to obtain commodities 
operation of our restaurants requires the purchase of energy and agricultural products 
occasionally  the availability of such commodities is limited due to circumstances beyond our control 
if we are unable to obtain such products we may be unable to offer certain products which would impact our profitability 
also  if the cost of such commodities increases we may be unable to implement appropriate price increases 
our success depends on our ability to judge the impact of competitive products and pricing 
successful operation of our restaurants requires the ability to identify the effects of product and pricing trends 
if we are unable to effectively evaluate the impact of product or pricing trends  we may fail to implement strategies allowing us to capitalize on those trends  which may result in decreased sales or increased costs 
our success depends on our ability to compete with our competitors 
the foodservice industry is intensely competitive with respect to the quality and value of food products offered  concept  service  price  dining experience and location 
we compete with major restaurant chains  some of whom dominate the qsr segment 
our competitors also include a variety of mid price  full service casual dining restaurants  health and nutrition oriented restaurants  delicatessens and prepared food restaurants  as well as supermarkets and convenience stores 
many of our competitors have substantially greater brand recognition and financial  marketing  operating and other resources than we have  which may give them competitive advantages 
our competitors also make changes to their pricing or other marketing strategies that may detrimentally impact us  as discussed under recent developments above 
as our competitors expand operations  we expect competition to intensify 
such increased competition could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our business depends on our suppliers abilities to provide quality products to us timely 
our profitability is dependent upon  among other things  our ability to offer fresh  high quality food at moderate prices 
while we continue to operate our own distribution business for most of our carl s jr 
system  we rely upon independent distributors for our hardee s restaurants 
in particular  our hardee s restaurants depend on the distribution services of mbm see discussion under purchasing above 
mbm is responsible for delivering food  packaging and other products from our vendors to our hardee s restaurants on a regular basis 
mbm also provides distribution services to most of our hardee s franchisees 
any disruption in these distribution services could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  our dependence on frequent deliveries of food and packaging products subjects our restaurants to the risk that shortages or interruptions in supply  caused by adverse weather or other conditions  could adversely affect the availability  quality and cost of ingredients 
our business may be significantly impacted by consumer preferences and perceptions 
foodservice businesses often are affected by changes in consumer tastes and perceptions 
traffic patterns and demographics  as well as the type  number and locations of competing restaurants  may adversely affect the performance of individual restaurants 
multi unit foodservice businesses such as ours can also be materially and adversely affected by publicity resulting from poor food quality  illness  injury or other health concerns or operating issues stemming from one or a limited number of restaurants 
we can be similarly affected by consumer concerns with respect to the nutritional value of quick service food 
our business may suffer due to our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel or if labor costs continue to increase 
until recently  the united states has experienced reduced levels of unemployment 
given that our restaurant level workforce requires large numbers of both entry level and skilled employees  future low levels of unemployment could compromise our ability to provide quality service in our restaurants 
from time to time  we have had difficulty hiring and maintaining qualified restaurant management personnel 
increases in the minimum wage have impacted our labor costs 
due to the labor intensive nature of our business  a continuing shortage of labor or increases in wage levels could have a negative effect on our results of operations 
cke restaurants  inc 

table of contents our sales and profits may be materially and adversely affected by our ability to successfully integrate acquisitions or mergers or derive the benefits we expect 
our future results of operations and cash flow may depend in part upon our ability to integrate acquisitions and mergers such as the acquisition of sbrg 
if we are unable to achieve the strategic operating objectives we anticipate from such acquisitions  we may experience increased costs or decreased sales which would have a negative impact on our results from operations 
strategic operating initiatives that we may be unable to achieve include opening a sufficient number of new restaurants  achieving economies of scale in operations  cost reduction  sales increases or marketing initiatives 
the recoverability of the  of goodwill that arose from the acquisition is dependent upon the ability of sbrg to operate profitably and to develop new la salsa restaurant sites 
the market for potentially successful sites is highly competitive 
our business may be impacted by increased insurance costs 
in the past we have been negatively affected by increases in both workers compensation insurance and general liability insurance due to our claims experience and rising healthcare costs 
although we seek to manage our claims to prevent increases  such increases can occur unexpectedly and without regard to our efforts to limit them 
if such increases occur  we may be unable to pass them along to the consumer through product price increases  resulting in decreased operating results 
our operations are seasonal and heavily influenced by weather conditions 
weather  which is unpredictable  can adversely impact our sales 
harsh weather conditions that keep customers from dining out result in lost opportunities for our restaurants 
a heavy snowstorm can leave an entire metropolitan area snowbound  resulting in a reduction in sales 
our first and fourth quarters  notably the fourth quarter  include winter months when there is historically a lower level of sales 
because a significant portion of our restaurant operating costs is fixed or semi fixed in nature  the loss of sales during these periods adversely impacts our operating margins  resulting in restaurant operating losses 
these adverse  weather driven events principally arise at our hardee s  and to a lesser extent  la salsa restaurants 
for these reasons  a quarter to quarter comparison is not a good indication of our performance or how we may perform in the future 
our financial results may be impacted by our ability to select appropriate restaurant locations  construct new restaurants or complete remodels 
in recent years  we have not opened a significant number of new restaurants as all available cash was used to repay bank indebtedness 
our strategic plan  and a component of our business turnaround  includes the construction of new restaurants and the remodeling of existing restaurants  including the installation of charbroilers 
the company and its franchisees face competition from other restaurant operators  retail chains  companies and developers for desirable site locations  which may adversely affect the cost  implementation and timing of the company s expansion plans 
if we experience delays in the construction process we may be unable to complete such construction activities at the planned cost  thereby adversely affecting our future results from operations 
additionally  there can be no assurance that such remodels and conversions will increase the revenues generated by these restaurants or  even if revenues are initially increased  that such increases will be sustainable 
likewise  we cannot be sure that the sites we select for new restaurants will indeed result in restaurants whose sales results meet our expectations 
our business may be affected by unfavorable outcomes on litigation 
as discussed below under the heading item legal proceedings  we have thousands of interactions and transactions each day with vendors  franchisees  customers  employees and others 
in the ordinary course of business  disputes may arise for a number of reasons 
we cannot be certain that we will prevail in every action brought against us 
our business is subject to requirements imposed by governmental regulations or interpretation of governmental regulations may change and require us to incur substantial expenditures to comply 
we are subject to governmental regulation at the federal  state and local level in many areas of our business  such as food safety and sanitation  the sale of alcoholic beverages  environmental issues and minimum wage 
while we endeavor to comply with all applicable laws and regulations  governmental units may make changes in the regulatory frameworks that we operate in that may require us to incur substantial cost increases in order to comply with such laws and regulations 
while we attempt to comply with all applicable laws and regulations  we cannot assure you that we are in full compliance with all laws and regulations at all times or that we will be able to comply with any future laws or regulations 
if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations  we may be subject to sanctions or civil remedies  including fines and injunctions 
the cost of compliance or the consequences of non compliance could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations

overview we are a nationwide owner  operator and franchisor of quick service restaurants  operating principally under the carl s jr 
and hardee s brand names 
based on united states system wide sales  our hardee s and carl s jr 
chains are the ninth and eleventh largest quick service hamburger restaurant chains in the united states of america  respectively according to the june  issue of nation s restaurant news 
as of january   the carl s jr 
system included restaurants  of which we operated restaurants and our franchisees and licensees operated restaurants 
the carl s jr 
restaurants are located in the western united states  predominantly in california 
as of january   the hardee s system consisted of  restaurants  of which we operated restaurants and our franchisees and licensees operated  restaurants 
hardee s restaurants are located primarily throughout the southeastern and midwestern united states 
we derive our revenue primarily from sales at company operated restaurants and revenue from franchisees  including franchise and royalty fees  sales to carl s jr 
franchisees and licensees of food and packaging products  rentals under real property leases and revenue from the sale of equipment to our franchisees 
restaurant operating expenses consist primarily of food and packaging costs  payroll and other employee benefits and occupancy and other operating expenses of company operated restaurants 
franchise operating costs include the cost of food and packaging products sold to carl s jr 
franchisees and licensees  lease payments on properties subleased to our franchisees and the costs of equipment purchases 
our revenue and expenses are directly affected by the number and sales volume of company operated restaurants and  to a lesser extent  franchised and licensed restaurants 
during periods in which we have reported positive same store sales  those increases were achieved by our strategy that emphasizes premium products  as well as routine price increases prompted by increases in labor  food or utility costs 
the impact of this strategy is evidenced by the increase in average guest check as shown in the tables on pages however  a possible consequence of this strategy has been a decrease in transaction counts  also shown in the same table  as some customers show a preference for lower priced fare 
many of our competitors strategies are to offer lower prices or discounted fare and those competitors have recently increased their efforts in this regard  which we believe has affected our transaction counts 
although difficult to quantify  we have generally experienced negative transaction counts at hardee s  at least since our acquisition of the brand  and at carl s jr 
for nearly two years  which we believe is due in part to increased competition from fast casual dining and other qsr companies offering products at discounted prices 
further  we note that others in the industry also are experiencing negative same store sales trends 
in addition  the fast food sector has been impacted by the economic downturn and potentially due to shifts in customer food preferences 
accordingly  we cannot quantify how much of our declines are related to our business segment and how much are related to circumstances involving our own brands 
nonetheless  we can make the observations below 
for the current year  carl s jr 
same store sales percentage increase was negatively impacted  vis vis prior year sales  by the fact that  in the prior year  our restaurant sales benefited significantly from the introduction of the six dollar burger 
beginning in the second quarter  we offered new products  chiefly the grilled onion cheeseburger  the jalapeno cheeseburger and the chili burger  along with advertising and media  to maintain and continue to grow same store sales 
these new products and advertising did not produce the intended results 
as a result  our same store sales for carl s jr 
were only slightly positive this fiscal year 
the six dollar burger was not introduced at hardee s until the third and fourth quarters of last fiscal year 
we experienced similar difficulties as described above for our hardee s concept 
we also believe that hardee s same store sales percentage cke restaurants  inc 

table of contents cke restaurants  inc 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis continued dollars in thousands was impacted by our decision to change hardee s from a brand that extensively offered discounted fare to one that used discounting to a more limited extent 
this decision was made in conjunction with our strategic shift to premium products  such as the six dollar burger  that has a higher profit percentage 
we realized that offering higher priced fare could adversely impact transaction counts and sales 
however  we felt that the strategy would improve operating margins see discussion below on hardee s operating margins 
as shown in the tables on pages  the operating margins for each brand have improved over the prior year 
for each brand  positive components of the comparative margins are the impact of lower food commodity prices and the change in menu mix to premium products  which have higher margins than discounted food offerings  as described above 
the company is currently experiencing an increase in the costs of business workers compensation and general liability insurance premiums  utilities  workers compensation claims costs in california as a result of assembly bill no 
 and food costs 
in the past  we have been successful at passing on such price increases  but it has likely had an impact on transaction counts as described above 
given that the qsr burger segment is experiencing a prolonged period of heavy discounting  we may be unable to institute price increases for several periods 
the sensitivity analysis for the recoverability of restaurants see impairment of property  equipment  property held and used and property held for sale or to be disposed of other than by sale assumes that our same store sales in the future grow at the same rate as the rate of inflation for our costs for delivering our products of food  labor  utilities  etc 
if we were unable to pass along such price increases  and at the same time could not increase our transaction counts  the recoverability of the carrying value of our restaurants would be impacted 
due to the current competitive discounting by major qsr companies  we are not raising prices at this time 
however  we believe that  in the long term  we will be able to raise prices to recover cost increases 
critical accounting policies our reported results are impacted by the application of certain accounting policies that require us to make subjective or complex judgments 
these judgments involve making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may significantly impact our quarterly or annual results of operations and financial condition 
we discuss the development  selection and disclosure of such estimates with our audit committee each quarter 
specific risks associated with these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
for all of these policies  we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as expected  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
we believe our most significant policies require estimation of future cash flows used to assess the recoverability of long lived assets  assess the recoverability of goodwill  and establish the estimated liability for closing restaurants and subsidizing sublease payments of franchisees  estimation  using actuarially determined methods  of our self insured claim losses under our workers compensation and fire and general liability insurance programs  determination of appropriate estimated liabilities for litigation  and determination of the appropriate allowances associated with franchise and license receivables and estimated liabilities for franchise subleases  estimation of our net deferred income tax asset valuation allowance

and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis continued dollars in thousands impairment of property  equipment  property held and used and property held for sale or to be disposed of other than by sale each quarter we evaluate the carrying value of individual restaurants when the operating results of a restaurant have reasonably progressed to a point to adequately evaluate the probability of continuing operating losses or a current expectation that a restaurant will be sold or otherwise disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
in making these judgments  we consider the period of time since the restaurant was opened or remodeled  the trend of operations and expectations for future sales growth of a restaurant 
for restaurants selected for review  we estimate the future estimated cash flows from operating the restaurant over its estimated useful life 
we make judgments about future same store sales and the operating expenses and estimated useful life that we would expect with such level of same store sales 
we employ a probability weighted approach wherein we estimate the effectiveness of future sales and marketing efforts on same store sales and related estimated useful life 
a material accounting judgment is the estimated useful life and  in general  in expected same store sales scenarios where sales are not expected to increase  we assume a shorter than previously estimated useful life 
on a quarterly basis  we update our model for estimating future cash flows based upon experience gained  current intentions about refranchising restaurants and closures  expected sales trends  internal plans  and other relevant information 
in prior fiscal years  because we were significantly engaged in refranchising restaurants to generate cash to repay bank indebtedness  we had assumed  in some cases  estimated lives that were less than the estimated useful life that a restaurant is functional as a restaurant 
as our financial position has improved such that refranchising activities are unnecessary  more restaurants assume estimated cash flows over their remaining estimated useful life as a restaurant 
additionally  commencing with the second quarter of this fiscal year  we reduced the probability weighting for the occurrence of future same stores sales from the higher range of our strategic business plan in light of our current same store sales results 
as the operations of restaurants opened or remodeled in recent years progress to the point that their profitability and prospects for future profitability can adequately be evaluated  additional restaurants will become subject to review and the possibility for an impairment in value exists 
most likely  this would arise in new markets the company expanded into in recent years 
as described above  same store sales are the key indicator in the estimation of future cash flow for evaluating recoverability of restaurants 
to provide a sensitivity analysis of the impairment that could arise were the actual same store sales increase of all restaurants we owned to grow at only the assumed rate of inflation for our operating costs  for no real growth  the aggregate additional impairment loss would be approximately the inflation rate assumed in making this calculation is for both revenue and expenses 
although we are temporarily not raising prices during this period of heavy competitive discounting  we believe  over time  we will be able to raise prices 
additionally  restaurants are operated for three years before we test them for impairment the three year rule 
we believe this provides the restaurant sufficient time to establish its presence in the market and build a customer base 
if we were to test all restaurants for impairment without regard to the amount of time the restaurants were operating  the total amount of potential asset impairment would increase substantially 
assuming all restaurants were tested under the same assumptions described above  we would be required to record additional impairment losses of approximately cke restaurants  inc

the impairment  if any  is measured based on the estimated fair value of the brand 
fair value can be determined based on discounted cash flows  comparable sales or valuations of other restaurant brands 
impairment occurs when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value 
the most significant assumptions we use in this analysis are those made in estimating future cash flows 
in estimating future cash flows  we generally use the financial assumptions in our strategic plan for items such as same store sales growth rates and the discount rate we consider to be the market discount rate for acquisitions of restaurant companies and brands 
if our assumptions used in performing the impairment test prove insufficient  the fair value of the brands may ultimately prove to be significantly lower  thereby causing the carrying value to exceed the fair value and indicating an impairment had occurred 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  we engaged an outside party to perform a valuation of the hardee s and carl s jr 
brands 
that valuation concluded that the current value of the goodwill associated with the acquisition of hardee s is and  accordingly  we recorded a transitional impairment charge to write off all of the goodwill related to the hardee s brand see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements of  as of january   we have  in goodwill recorded on the balance sheet as costs in excess of assets acquired  net  which primarily relates to sbrg and carl s jr 
estimated liability for self insurance we are self insured for a portion of our current and prior years losses related to workers compensation  fire and general liability insurance programs 
we have obtained stop loss insurance for individual workers compensation claims and individual general liability claims over insurance liabilities and reserves are accounted for based on the net present value of independent actuarial estimates of the amount of losses incurred 
these estimates rely on actuarial observations of historical claim loss development 
the actuary  in determining the estimated liability  bases the assumptions on the average historical losses on claims we have incurred 
the actual loss development may be better or worse than the development estimated by the actuary 
in that event  we will modify the reserve 
consistent with trends the restaurant industry has experienced in recent years  particularly in california where claim cost trends are among the highest in the country  workers compensation liability premiums continue to increase 
additionally  our fire and general liability insurance premiums continue to increase

we account for contingent obligations in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  which requires that we assess each contingency to determine estimates of the degree of probability and range of possible settlement 
those contingencies that are deemed to be probable and where the amount of such settlement is reasonably estimable are accrued in our consolidated financial statements 
if only a range of loss can be determined  we accrue to the low end of the range 
the assessment of contingencies is a highly subjective process that requires judgments about future events 
contingencies are reviewed at least quarterly to determine the adequacy of the accruals and related consolidated financial statement disclosure 
the ultimate settlement of contingencies may differ materially from amounts we have accrued in our consolidated financial statements 
estimated liability for closing restaurants we make decisions to close restaurants based on the lack of prospects for future estimated profitability and sometimes we are forced to close restaurants based on circumstances beyond our control eg  a landlord s refusal to negotiate a new lease 
our restaurant operators evaluate each restaurant s performance every quarter 
when restaurants continue to perform poorly  we consider the demographics of the location  as well as the likelihood of being able to turn an unprofitable restaurant around 
based on the operator s judgment  we estimate the future cash flows 
if we determine that the restaurant will not  within a reasonable period of time  operate at break even cash flow or be profitable  and there are no contractual requirements to continue operating the restaurant  we close the restaurant 
additionally  franchisees may close restaurants for which we are the primary lessee 
if the franchisee cannot make payments on the lease  we continue making the lease payments and establish an estimated liability for the closed restaurant if we decide not to operate it as a company operated restaurant 
we establish the estimated liability on the actual closure date 
prior to the adoption of sfas on january   we established the estimated liability when we identified a restaurant for closure  which may or may not have been the actual closure date 
the estimated liability for closing restaurants on properties vacated is generally based on the term of the lease and the lease termination fee we expect to pay  as well as estimated maintenance costs until the lease has been abated 
the amount of the estimated liability established is the net present value of these estimated future payments 
the interest rate used to calculate the net present value of these liabilities is based on our incremental borrowing rate at the time the liability is established 
the related discount is amortized and shown as a component of interest expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
a significant assumption used in determining the amount of the estimated liability for closing restaurants is the amount of the estimated liability for future lease payments on vacant restaurants  which we determined based on our third party broker s a related party assessment of its ability to successfully negotiate an early termination of our lease agreement with the lessor 
additionally  we estimate the cost to maintain leased and owned vacant properties until the lease has been abated 
if the costs to maintain properties increase  or it takes longer than anticipated to sell properties or terminate leases  we may need to record additional estimated liabilities 
if the leases on the vacant restaurants are not terminated on the terms we used to estimate the liabilities  we may be required to record losses in future periods 
conversely  if the leases on the vacant restaurants are terminated on more favorable terms than we used to estimate the liabilities  we reverse previously established estimated liabilities 
the net present value of lease payments on all closed restaurants is approximately  which represents the discounted amount we would be required to pay if we are unable to terminate any of the leases prior to the terms required in the lease agreements 
however  it is our experience that we can terminate those leases for less than that amount and  accordingly  we have recorded an estimated liability for lease obligations of  as of january  cke restaurants  inc

and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis continued dollars in thousands franchised and licensed operations we monitor the financial condition of franchisees and record provisions for estimated losses on receivables when we believe that our franchisees are unable to make their required payments to us 
each quarter we perform a franchisee by franchisee analysis and develop estimated bad debts for each franchisee 
we then compare the aggregate result of that analysis to the amount recorded in our consolidated financial statements as the allowance for bad debt and adjust the allowance as appropriate 
from period to period our assessment of individual franchisees changes  however  we have had some franchisees  who in the past we had determined required an estimated loss equal to the total amount of the receivable  who have paid us in full or established a consistent record of payments generally one year such that we determined an allowance was no longer required 
additionally  we cease accruing royalty income from franchisees that are materially delinquent in paying or in default and reverse any royalties accrued during the last days 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  our analysis revealed that two franchisees  for which we had previously established a reserve on their receivables balances  had made progress in repaying amounts owed to us one had made timely payments of all amounts owed for consecutive months and the other paid his note in full 
these circumstances were reflected in establishing the allowance for bad debt 
depending on the facts and circumstances  there are a number of different actions we may take to resolve collections issues 
these may include the purchase of franchise restaurants by us or by other franchisees  a modification to the franchise agreement which may include a provision to defer certain royalty payments or reduce royalty rates in the future if royalty rates are not sufficient to cover our costs of service over the life of the franchise agreement  we record an estimated loss at the time we modify the agreements  a restructuring of the franchisee s business and or finances including the restructuring of leases for which we are the primary obligee see further discussion below or  if necessary  the termination of the franchise agreement 
the allowance established is based on our assessment of the most probable course of action that will occur 
if we believe we will operate the restaurants as company operated restaurants  the allowance for loss is recorded net of the estimated fair value of the related restaurant assets 
many of the restaurants that we sold to franchisees as part of our refranchising program were on leased sites 
generally  we remained principally liable for the lease and entered into a sublease with the franchisee on the same terms as the primary lease 
we account for the sublease payments received as franchising rental income 
our payments on the leases are accounted for as rental expense in franchised and licensed restaurants in our consolidated statement of operations 
as of january   the net present value of the total obligation on such lease arrangements was  in addition to the sublease arrangements with franchisees described above  the company also leases land and buildings to franchisees 
as of january   the net book value of land and building under lease to hardee s franchisees is  and  to carl s jr 
franchisees 
in the event that a troubled franchisee closes a restaurant for which the land and or building is owned by us  our options are to operate the restaurant as a company owned restaurant  lease the land and or building to another tenant  or sell the land and or building 
these circumstances would cause us to consider whether the carrying value of the land and building was impaired and if we determined the property value was impaired  we would record a charge to earnings for the amount that the carrying value of the property exceeds its fair value 
as of january   the net book value of land and buildings under lease to hardee s franchisees that are considered to be troubled franchisees as described below was approximately  we know that during fiscal  some of these franchisees will probably close restaurants and  accordingly  the company may record an impairment loss in connection with some of these closures 
prior to adoption of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for the costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements  the determination of when to establish an estimated liability for future lease obligations on restaurants operated by franchisees for which we are the primary obligee was based on the date that either of the following events occur the franchisee and the company mutually decided to close a restaurant and we assumed the responsibility for the lease  usually after a franchise agreement was terminated or the franchisee declared bankruptcy  or cke restaurants  inc 

table of contents cke restaurants  inc 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis continued dollars in thousands we entered into a workout agreement with a financially troubled franchisee  wherein we agreed to make part or all of the lease payment for the franchisee 
in accordance with sfas  which was adopted on january   an estimated liability for future lease obligations on restaurants operated by franchisees for which we are the primary obligee is established on the date the franchisee closes the restaurant see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the amount of the estimated liability is established using the methodology described in estimated liability for closing restaurants above 
troubled franchisees ie  those with whom we have entered into workout agreements  as described under hardee s franchise operations below  may have liquidity problems in the future 
consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  we have not established an additional estimated liability for this eventuality 
the net present value of the related lease obligation with all troubled franchisees in these circumstances is approximately  two franchisees represent of this amount 
we do not anticipate that the majority of such franchisees will be involved in future situations wherein we will have to record an additional liability for such subleases 
however  no assurances can be given 
as of january   we have recorded an estimated liability for future lease obligations related to agreed upon subsidies for these franchise restaurants of  if sales trends economic conditions worsen for our franchisees  their financial health may worsen  our collection rates may decline and we may be required to assume the responsibility for additional lease payments on franchised restaurants 
entering into restructured franchise agreements may result in reduced franchise royalty rates in the future see discussion below 
the likelihood of needing to increase the estimated liability for future lease obligations is related to the success of our hardee s concept ie  if our hardee s concept results improve from the execution of our comprehensive plan  we would reasonably expect that the financial performance of our franchisees would improve 
valuation allowance for net deferred tax asset as disclosed in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements  we record net deferred tax assets 
if our business turnaround is successful and we have been profitable for a number of years and our prospects for future profitability are reasonably assured  we would then reverse our valuation allowance 
in assessing the prospects for future profitability  many of the assessments of same store sales and cash flows mentioned above become relevant 
when circumstances warrant  we assess the likelihood that our net deferred tax assets will more likely than not be recovered from future taxable income 
during fiscal  because we had experienced two years of net operating losses  we established a valuation allowance for our net deferred tax asset 
as of january   our deferred tax assets and valuation allowance totaled approximately  factors affecting comparability of fiscal years  and our fiscal year results in a fifty third week every fifth or sixth year 
fiscal  and include weeks of operations 
our results reflect the substantial changes we have made in executing our business turnaround including the sale and closure of restaurants  the reduction of corporate overhead  our efforts to improve margins and repay bank indebtedness  and certain non recurring transactions in fiscal an income tax refund and gains on the sale of checkers stock and gains on the repurchase of convertible subordinated notes

c this amount consists of a  improvement from carl s jr 
restaurants and a decline of  in hardee s restaurants during fiscal  as compared to fiscal although discussed below  carl s jr 
s improvement is due to a modest improvement in same store sales coupled with an increase in operating margins 
the decline in hardee s is primarily a function of negative same store sales for the year and because the increase in the margin percentage for the year is largely attributable to closing unprofitable restaurants see the table in operating review hardees below 
d as we do not expect to benefit from the material one time items next year  such as the one time tax refund and the sale of checkers stock  will likely incur additional interest expense in connection with refinancing our convertible debt  view the overall impact of the current competitive environment as temporarily limiting our ability to raise prices to offset cost increases  and have identified other factors in management s discussion and analysis in this form k that could impact next year s results  we do not currently expect to report an increase in earnings without repositioning activities and change in accounting for goodwill next fiscal year 
restaurant portfolio strategy as described above  in late fiscal we embarked on a refranchising initiative to generate cash to reduce outstanding borrowings on our senior credit facility  as well as increase the number of franchise operated restaurants 
additionally  as sales trends for the hardee s restaurants and certain carl s jr 
restaurants primarily in the oklahoma area continued to decline in fiscal through fiscal  we determined that it was necessary to close certain restaurants for which a return to profitability was not likely 
these repositioning activities resulted in the charges generally reflected in our financial statements as facility action charges 
we have made reductions to operating expenses in an effort to bring them to levels commensurate with our re balanced restaurant portfolio 
during fiscal  we recorded repositioning charges of  which were primarily non cash in nature and consisted of net facility action charges 
during fiscal  we recorded repositioning charges of  these charges  which were primarily non cash in nature  consisted of net facility action charges of  a charge of approximately  recorded as interest expense reflecting the write off of deferred loan costs as a result of modification of our credit facility and approximately  relating to severance costs

we believe we have substantially completed our repositioning activities and are now able to focus on the operations of our core brands  carl s jr 
and hardee s 
we have substantially completed the closure of under performing restaurants 
however  there can be no guarantee that we will not determine in the future that additional repositioning activities will be necessary or that we would not take advantage of opportunities to generate funds through additional restaurant asset sales  which could result in losses  which may be material

that program focuses on the fundamentals of restaurant operations hiring good people  focusing them on the guests  serving hot quality food  and keeping the restaurants clean 
the continuation of our business turnaround is based on the following next steps maintaining the profitability of the carl s jr

such circumstances would affect our ability to access both the amount and terms of financing available to us in the future see liquidity and capital resources section below 
hardee s revolution we have introduced a comprehensive plan to revitalize hardee s involving a repositioning of the brand as a premium burger restaurant 
we refer to this comprehensive plan as the hardee s revolution 
the new plan includes menu adjustments and associated advertising and media strategies 
in january  we announced a new menu focus for hardee s featuring angus beef burgers 
this new menu  along with related media  seeks to distinguish hardee s as a premium burger specialist 
we expect to execute the plan in all company operated restaurants during the first quarter of fiscal after a restaurant is converted to the new menu  there may be an initial decrease in same store sales because of menu deletions and as customers learn of the change in the menu 
we believe it will take time for the public to become aware of  and try  our new products 
in short  our plan will take time to be effective 
also  as we have been converting to the new format  we have experienced an increase in food and labor costs as restaurant workers are trained to prepare the new menu items 
we can provide no assurance that the reversal of those trends  either separately or jointly  will continue in either the restaurants already converted or those restaurants converted in the future 
we have  to date  incurred inventory obsolescence costs in the amount of as a result of the elimination of certain menu items 
we are converting all of our hardee s restaurants to a new menu focused on angus beef burgers 
in addition to the new thickburger  a number of items are eliminated from the menu 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  a charge of was recorded for obsolete packaging inventory as a result of the menu adjustments made in connection with hardee s new menu focus 
as a result of the conversion  we expect to incur additional losses for obsolete food and packaging inventory in the future 
as we convert hardee s restaurants to the new menu format  we will begin television advertising 
for all the reasons discussed in this section  the conversion to the new format will impact our operating results for the first and second quarters of fiscal and  accordingly  those quarterly results may not be indicative of future results 
franchisees operations like others in the quick service restaurant industry  some of our franchise operators experience financial difficulties from time to time with respect to their franchise operations 
our approach to dealing with financial and operational issues that arise from these situations is described under critical accounting policies above  under the heading franchise and licensed operations 
some franchise operators in the hardee s system have experienced significant financial problems and  as discussed above  there are a number of potential resolutions of these financial issues 
we continue to work with franchisees in an attempt to maximize our future franchising income 
our franchising income is dependent on both the number of restaurants operated by franchisees and their operational and financial success  such that they can make their contractual royalty payments to us 
although we review quarterly the allowance for bad debts and the estimated liability for closed franchise restaurants see discussion under critical accounting policies franchised and license operations  there can be no assurance that the number of franchise operators or restaurants experiencing financial cke restaurants  inc 

table of contents cke restaurants  inc 
and subsidiaries management s discussion and analysis continued dollars in thousands difficulties will not increase from our current assessments  nor can there be any assurance that we will be successful in resolving financial issues relating to any specific franchise operator 
during the prior fiscal year  we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts at hardee s from of the gross balance of accounts and notes receivable to 
during the current year  our allowance for doubtful accounts decreased slightly to of the gross balance of accounts and notes receivable 
during fiscal year  we have seen collections stabilize and the required allowance modestly decrease 
however  we still experience specific problems with certain franchisees and expect to continue to enter into what we refer to as workout agreements with troubled franchisees see critical accounting policies franchised and licensed operations above 
the result is an effective royalty rate lower than our contractual royalty rate 
the following table is a reconciliation of our contractual royalty rate to our effective royalty rate for fiscal year standard royalty rate contractual reductions  workout agreements  and franchisees in default effective royalty rate fourth quarter adjustments during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we changed hardee s year end date from the last wednesday in january january  to the last monday in january january  to coincide with the fiscal year end of carl s jr

our ongoing utility costs for our california restaurants will be higher than what we paid under the enron contract and we estimate that increase to be approximately  annually 
additionally  our energy costs may increase an additional  per year for the next three years due to the efforts of the state of california to recoup perceived additional prices paid to energy suppliers in recent years through increased future billings

impact of inflation inflation has an impact on food and packaging  construction  occupancy  labor and benefit costs  all of which can significantly affect our operations 
historically  consistent with the industry  we have been able to pass along to our customers  through price increases  higher costs arising from these inflationary factors 
seasonality our business is affected by seasonality 
average restaurant sales are normally higher in the summer months than during the winter months for each of our restaurant concepts 
in comparison with our carl s jr 
restaurant concept  inclement weather has a greater impact on restaurant sales at our hardee s restaurants  because a significant number of them are located in areas that experience severe winter conditions  principally in the midwest and certain east coast locations 
competition as discussed previously in item business  the foodservice industry is intensively competitive with respect to several factors 
we compete with a variety of foodservice companies 
because our competition is a diverse group major restaurant chains  casual dining restaurants  nutrition oriented restaurants and prepared food stores  it is difficult for us to attribute specific results of operations to the actions of any of our competitors 
however  our operations have been affected by the current competitive price discounting undertaken by our competitors 
liquidity and capital resources our need for liquidity during the next months will arise primarily from the refinancing of our senior credit facility facility and our convertible subordinated notes convertible notes shortly thereafter and funding for capital cke restaurants  inc

the facility  which matures on december   is extendable  by its terns  to november   provided we have completed the repurchase or refinancing of our convertible notes  effectively accelerating the maturity of the convertible notes 
we have historically financed our operations through internally generated funds and borrowings under our credit facilities 
we anticipate that existing cash balances  availability under the facility  cash generated from operations and anticipated new financing will be sufficient to service existing debt and to meet our operating and capital requirements for the next twelve months 
we have no mandatory payments of principal on the  of senior subordinated notes outstanding prior to their final maturities in we arranged for the facility to efficiently fund letters of credit required as part of our self insurance programs 
additionally  the facility provides working capital during those periods when seasonality affects our cash flow 
the outstanding balance on the facility at the end of the fiscal year is a result of many factors including the amount of capital expenditures made during the year and the fact the fourth quarter is seasonally our weakest quarter for sales 
we  as well as the restaurant industry in general  maintain relatively low levels of accounts receivable and inventories  and vendors grant trade credit for purchases such as food and supplies 
we also continually invest in our business through the addition of new sites and the refurbishment of existing sites  which are reflected as long term assets and not as part of working capital 
as a result  we typically maintain current liabilities in excess of current assets resulting in a working capital deficit 
as of january   our current ratio was to the facility permits borrowings of up to  as of january   we had  outstanding under our senior credit facility   outstanding on standby letters of credit and available borrowings of  in addition to a blanket lien  certain assets secure the facility  including all of our personal property assets and certain restaurant property deeds of trust with an estimated sales value of  borrowings bear interest at either the libor rate plus an applicable margin or the prime rate plus an applicable margin  with interest due monthly 
the applicable interest rate at january  is prime rate plus  or per annum 
the agreement underlying the facility includes certain restrictive covenants 
among other things  these covenants restrict our ability to incur debt  incur liens on our assets  make any significant change in our corporate structure or the nature of our business  dispose of assets in the above described collateral pool  prepay certain debt  engage in a change of control transaction without the member banks consents  pay dividends  make investments or acquisitions and incur capital expenditures 
subject to the terms of the agreement  we can make capital expenditures of  per year  modified based on actual ebitda and provided that  is available on the facility at the time the expenditures are made 
the full text of the contractual requirements imposed by this financing is set forth in the fourth amended and restated credit agreement which has been filed with the securities and exchange commission 
we were in compliance with such requirements as of january  subject in certain instances to cure periods  the lenders under our facility may demand repayment of these borrowings prior to stated maturity upon certain events  including if we breach the terms of our agreement  suffer a material adverse change  engage in a change of control transaction  suffer certain adverse legal judgments  in the event of specified events of insolvency or if we default other significant obligations 
in the event the facility is declared accelerated by the lenders which can occur only if we are in default under the facility  our senior subordinated notes senior notes due and the convertible notes may also become accelerated under certain circumstances and after all cure periods have expired 
the convertible notes  which are unsecured obligations  are governed by an indenture 
the indenture requires that we pay interest at a rate of per annum in semi annual coupons due on each march and september  with all outstanding principal due and payable in march we have the right to prepay the notes at any time for an amount equal to principal  accrued interest and a premium  subject to a notice requirement 
the premium  as of january   is of the principal amount redeemed  but reduces annually through at which point no premium is payable

restricted payments include certain loans  treasury stock repurchases and voluntary repurchases of outstanding debt

the terms of our significant financing agreements  the facility  the convertible notes and the senior notes  are not dependent on any change in our credit rating 
we believe the key company specific factors affecting our ability to maintain our existing debt financing relationships and to access such capital in the future are our present and expected levels of profitability and cash flow from operations  asset collateral bases and the level of equity capital of the company relative to the level of debt obligations 
in addition  as noted above  our existing agreements include significant restrictions on future financings including  among others  limits on the amount of indebtedness we may incur and whether or not such indebtedness may be secured by any of our assets 
because our bank indebtedness matures in advance of the maturity of the convertible notes  we may be obliged to incur additional indebtedness prior to the maturity of the facility 
further  because of restrictions on voluntary prepayments of indebtedness under our indenture on our senior notes see discussion above  we may be in a position where we are simultaneously incurring interest expense on the convertible debt and new debt for a period of time 
any new debt will be at a higher coupon rate than the present convertible debt s coupon 
because of these circumstances  we expect to incur higher interest expense during fiscal than the current year 
we are considering various strategies to address the maturation the convertible notes 
strategies we may implement include obtaining new bank debt  a public debt offering  a restructuring of our existing convertible debt  the sale of restaurants  or some combination thereof 
in the event that we are unable to successfully implement one or more of those options we may be required to sell additional restaurants  which may be at a loss  to raise sufficient funds to retire the debt 
those losses may be material and may have a significant negative impact on our operating results 
during the fiscal year ended january   cash provided by operating activities was  cash used in investing activities during the fiscal year ended january   totaled  which principally consisted of purchases of property and equipment  which were partially offset by proceeds from the sale of checkers stock and sales of surplus property 
cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended january   totaled  which principally consisted of repurchases of convertible debt and repayments of short term debt

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk dollars in thousands interest rate risk our principal exposure to financial market risks relates to the impact that interest rate changes could have on our  senior credit facility  of which  was outstanding as of january  borrowings under the facility bear interest at the prime rate or libor plus an applicable margin 
a hypothetical increase of basis points in short term interest rates would result in a reduction in the company s annual pre tax earnings of the estimated reduction is based upon the outstanding balance of the facility and assumes no change in the volume  index or composition of debt as in effect january  substantially all of our business is transacted in us dollars 
accordingly  foreign exchange rate fluctuations have not had a significant impact on us and are not expected to in the foreseeable future 
commodity price risk we purchase certain products which are affected by commodity prices and are  therefore  subject to price volatility caused by weather  market conditions and other factors which are not considered predictable or within our control 
although many of the products purchased are subject to changes in commodity prices  certain purchasing contracts or pricing arrangements contain risk management techniques designed to minimize price volatility 
the purchasing contracts and pricing arrangements we use may result in unconditional purchase obligations  which are not reflected in the consolidated balance sheet 
typically  we use these types of purchasing techniques to control costs as an alternative to directly managing financial instruments to hedge commodity prices 
in many cases  we believe we will be able to address material commodity cost increases by adjusting our menu pricing or changing our product delivery strategy 
however  increases in commodity prices  without adjustments to our menu prices see page  could result in lower restaurant level operating margins for our restaurant concepts
