in  sales were favorably impacted by currency fluctuations approximately million 
in  changes in exchange rates  such as for the euro and pound sterling  negatively impacted the company 
the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on net income is smaller than the impact on net sales  because the company s products are generally sourced in the currencies in which they are sold

to reduce its exposure to currency fluctuations  the company may enter into foreign exchange forward  option and swap contracts  and interest rate contracts  where appropriate and available

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions for the reporting period and as of the financial statement date 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
actual results could differ from those amounts 
critical accounting policies are those that are important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and which require management to make difficult  subjective and or complex judgements 
critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown 
the company believes that critical accounting policies include accounting for sales rebates  accounting for allowances for doubtful accounts and accounting for inventory reserves 
sales rebates and discounts are common practice in the industries in which the company operates 
volume  promotional  price  cash and other discounts and customer incentives are accounted for as a reduction to gross sales 
rebates and discounts are recorded based upon management s best estimates when products are sold 
these estimates are based upon historical experience for similar programs and products 
management reviews such rebates and discounts on an ongoing basis and accruals for rebates and discounts are adjusted  if necessary  as additional information becomes available 
management is required to make judgements  based on historical experience and future expectations  as to the collectibility of accounts receivable 
the allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns represent allowances for customer trade accounts receivable that are estimated to be partially or entirely uncollectible 
these allowances are used to reduce gross trade receivables to their net realizable value 
the company records these allowances based on estimates related to the following factors i customer specific allowances  ii amounts based upon an aging schedule  and iii an estimated amount  based on the company s historical experience  for issues not yet identified 
in addition  approximately percent and percent of trade receivables were from nine retail customers of the company s office products business in and  respectively 
the financial position and operations of these customers are monitored on an ongoing basis 

table of contents inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value and are categorized as raw materials  work in progress or finished goods 
inventory reserves are recorded for damaged  obsolete  excess and slow moving inventory 
management uses estimates to record these reserves 
slow moving inventory is reviewed by category and may be partially or fully reserved for depending on the type of product and the length of time the product has been included in inventory

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market sensitive instruments and risk management the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate changes 
the company s policy is not to hold or purchase foreign currency or interest rate contracts for trading purposes 
the company s objective in managing the exposure to foreign currency changes is to reduce the risk on earnings and cash flow associated with foreign exchange rate changes 
as a result  the company enters into foreign exchange forward  option and swap contracts to reduce risks associated with the value of its existing foreign currency assets  liabilities  firm commitments and anticipated foreign revenues and costs 
the gains and losses on these contracts are intended to offset changes in the related exposures 
the company does not hedge its foreign currency exposure in a manner that would entirely eliminate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on the company s consolidated net income 
the company s objective in managing its exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows 
to achieve its objectives  the company will periodically use interest rate contracts to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to its borrowings 
the company entered into a forward starting interest rate swap in may to secure the interest rate on the company s anticipated long term debt issuance 
the principal amount hedged was million 
because of a shift in interest rates  an unrealized loss of approximately million was included in other comprehensive loss at the end of in connection with the issuance of the million year senior notes  the company settled the interest rate swap at a loss of approximately million 
the loss will be amortized to interest expense over years  which corresponds to the term of the related debt 
in the normal course of operations  the company also faces other risks that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable 
such risks principally include changes in economic or political conditions  other risks associated with foreign operations  commodity price risk and litigation risks  which are not represented in the analyses that follow 

table of contents foreign exchange value at risk the company uses a value at risk var model to determine the estimated maximum potential one day loss in earnings associated with both its foreign exchange positions and contracts 
this approach assumes that market rates or prices for foreign exchange positions and contracts are normally distributed 
the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions 
firm commitments  receivables and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies  which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge  were included in the model 
forecasted transactions  which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge  were excluded from the model 
the var was estimated using a variance covariance methodology based on historical volatility for each currency 
the volatility and correlation used in the calculation were based on two year historical data obtained from one of the company s domestic banks 
a percent confidence level was used for a one day time horizon 
the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that could be incurred by the company  nor does it consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors 
the estimated maximum potential one day loss in earnings for the company s foreign exchange positions and contracts was million at year end interest rate sensitivity an assumed basis point move in interest rates percent of the company s weighted average floating rate interest rate affecting the company s variable rate borrowings would have had an immaterial effect on the company s earnings
