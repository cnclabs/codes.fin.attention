overview we provide integrated web conferencing services that offer simple  reliable and cost effective tools for everyday business meetings and events 
these services offer a continuum of real time  interactive communications tools for businesses  including automated phone conferencing  web conferencing for web presentations with online controls and advanced collaboration tools  which allow users  among other things  to share applications  tour the web and whiteboard ideas online 
we sell these services to large and medium sized businesses in various markets  as well as to resellers of conferencing and communications services through our direct  strategic and indirect sales channels 
except for the quarter ended december   we have incurred losses since commencing operations and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our net loss was million and our net income was million for the quarters ended december  and  respectively  and our net losses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we have not achieved profitability on an annual basis 
we may incur losses at least for the next several quarters  particularly due to significant non cash charges for amortization of deferred stock based compensation and depreciation expense and an anticipated increase in sales and marketing expenditures 
despite the progress we have made in managing and controlling expenses  we will need to generate higher revenue to support expected expenses and sustain profitability 
on june   we acquired contigo software  inc we have included the results of operations of contigo subsequent to june  in our statements of operations 
this acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and we recorded million of goodwill in the quarter ended june   which we were amortizing over a period of three years 
for the year ended december   amortization expense pertaining to goodwill was million 
to the extent we did not generate sufficient cash flow to recover the amount of the investment recorded  the investment would be considered impaired and could be subject to earlier write off 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued two pronouncements that affected business combinations and amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets for previously recorded business combinations 
as a result of this new guidance  effective january  we no longer record amortization on our acquired goodwill but instead review goodwill for impairment on an annual basis 
in addition  our initial assessment of goodwill performed as of march  indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the goodwill carrying value  and therefore  at that time  goodwill was not deemed to be impaired 
for a discussion of the methodology and assumptions or estimates used to test goodwill for impairment  see the section entitled critical accounting policies and estimates below and the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page f on april   we acquired substantially all of the assets of interact conferencing  llc  a nationwide reseller of audio and web conferencing services 
as a result of the acquisition  we expanded our sales force  increased our revenue and reduced our net loss for the year ended december  we also assumed certain liabilities of interact as of april   consisting primarily of accounts payable and a  line of credit 
we also assumed a facility lease obligation of approximately million associated with a building that is partially owned by the former president and chief executive officer of interact who became an officer of the company upon the completion of the acquisition 
effective may   the results of interact s operations are included in our consolidated financial statements 
the aggregate purchase consideration paid to interact was approximately 
table of contents million  which is comprised of million in cash and  shares of our common stock valued at million 
in addition  we incurred million in acquisition related expenses 
 shares of our common stock were deemed to represent contingent purchase consideration and accordingly  we recorded million in deferred stock based compensation  which is being expensed over three years 
the value of the common stock issued was determined based on the average market price of our common stock over the three day period before and after the terms of the acquisition were agreed upon and announced 
the purchase price of million was allocated as follows million was allocated to the net identifiable assets acquired and million was allocated to goodwill 
prior to our restructuring in january  we derived revenue from services other than our web conferencing services 
as part of the restructuring  we indicated our intent to primarily focus on our core web conferencing service offerings 
accordingly  the second quarter of was the final quarter in which revenue was generated from legacy services 
we expect to derive all of our revenue in the future from our current services and any next generation services that we develop 
the following describes how we recognized revenue for the services we offered in  and web and phone conferencing revenue 
revenue for our web and phone conferencing service is generally based upon the actual time that each participant is on the phone or logged onto the web 
for example  a customer is charged a per minute  per user fee for each participant listening and viewing a live or recorded simulcast 
in addition  we charge customers a one time fee to upload visuals for a phone conference or a recorded simulcast 
we recognize usage revenue from our web and phone conferencing services as soon as a call or simulcast of a call is completed 
we recognize revenue associated with any initial set up fees ratably over the term of the contract 
web conferencing pro revenue 
revenue for our web conferencing pro service is derived from subscription and usage fees in addition to event fees or  in more limited cases  a software license fee 
revenue from subscriptions is recognized monthly regardless of usage  while usage fees are based upon either monthly connections or minutes used 
event fees are generally hourly charges that are recognized as the events take place 
we recognize revenue associated with any initial set up fees ratably over the term of the contract 
revenue from software license agreements is recognized upon shipment of the software when all the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  collectibility is probable  and vendor specific objective evidence is available for the fair value of all undelivered elements 
webcasting revenue legacy service 
prices and specific service terms were usually negotiated in advance of service delivery 
we recognized revenue from live event streaming when the content was broadcast over the internet 
we recognized revenue from encoding recorded content when the content became available for viewing over the internet 
we recognized revenue from pre recorded content hosting ratably over the hosting period 
talking email revenue legacy service 
prices and specific service terms were negotiated in advance of service delivery 
we recognized revenue  including any setup fees  ratably over the life of the contract 
while our business model is largely usage based  which generally means that our customers only pay for the services they use  our non usage revenue  such as from subscriptions  has increased in absolute dollars 
in the quarter ended december   of our revenue was non usage based as compared to in the quarter ended december  for the year ended december   of our revenue was non usage based as compared to in the year ended december  we expect our non usage based revenue to decrease as a percentage of revenue in the near term due to a transition by qwest communications of a subscription contract for web conferencing pro to a usage based contract 
our cost of revenue consists primarily of telecommunication expenses  depreciation of network and data center equipment  internet access fees and fees paid to network providers for bandwidth  equipment maintenance contract expenses  compensation and benefits for operations personnel and allocated overhead 
our telecommunication expenses are variable and directly correlate to the use of our services and primarily are incurred when our customers use our web and phone conferencing service 
a change in our mix of usage and non usage based revenue will affect our gross profit as our cost of revenue is typically higher on our usage based web and phone conferencing service 
our depreciation  internet access and bandwidth expenses  equipment maintenance expenses and compensation expenses generally increase as we increase our capacity and build our infrastructure 
we will continue to make investments in our infrastructure  however  we do not expect a need for large scale capital expenditures in the first quarter of as a result  we expect expenses for depreciation  internet access and bandwidth expenses to slightly increase in absolute dollars 
we expect that our current capacity and infrastructure  
table of contents coupled with the capital expenditures we have made and we expect to make  will accommodate our revenue projections into the first half of we have a limited number of sources for our telephony services 
one of our suppliers is worldcom  which filed for chapter bankruptcy protection in july if worldcom was to terminate or interrupt its services  we may experience difficulties in obtaining alternative sources on commercially reasonable terms  if at all  and would likely experience an increase in our variable telephony cost 
we incur sales and marketing expenses that consist primarily of the salaries  commissions and benefits for our sales and marketing personnel  remote sales offices expenses  market research  sales lead generation and telemarketing expenses and allocated overhead 
in the fourth quarter of and continuing into the first quarter of  we streamlined our sales force  renegotiated certain sales and marketing commitments and consolidated certain remote sales offices 
we believe that we have experienced substantially all the benefits of these cost savings initiatives 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue as we expand our sales force and increase our marketing initiatives in we incur research and development expenses that consist primarily of salaries and benefits for research and development personnel  equipment maintenance contract expenses and allocated overhead 
we expense research and development costs as they are incurred  except for certain capitalized costs associated with internally developed software 
we capitalized million of internally developed software in we expect to continue to capitalize costs associated with internally developed software in  particularly as we develop our next generation service 
we also expect to continue to make investments in research and development and anticipate that these expenditures will increase in terms of absolute dollars in  however  we expect them to decrease as a percentage of revenue in we incur general and administrative expenses that consist primarily of expenses related to finance  human resources  administrative and general management activities  including legal  accounting and other professional fees  in addition to other general corporate expenses 
we expect general and administrative expenses to remain relatively flat in terms of absolute dollars  however  we expect them to decrease as a percentage of revenue in amortization of goodwill was first recorded in in connection with our acquisition of contigo software  inc in june goodwill was amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of three years 
effective january   we adopted sfas which requires that goodwill no longer be amortized  but instead will be reviewed for impairment on an on going basis 
accordingly  the amortization of goodwill ceased upon our adoption of the statement  which was january  since our inception  we have used stock based compensation for employees  consultants and members of our board of directors to attract and retain strong business and technical personnel 
during the year ended december  we recorded million of deferred stock based compensation and we expensed million related to stock based compensation 
million of the deferred stock based compensation was recorded in the second quarter of and relates to  shares of common stock we issued simultaneously with the closing of the interact acquisition  which are being held in escrow and are scheduled to be released in equal one third increments and will be expensed over three years  beginning in may the release of the stock held in escrow is contingent upon certain employment obligations of carolyn bradfield  the former president and chief executive officer of interact 
the value of these escrowed shares was determined based on the average market price of our common stock over the three day period before and after the terms of the acquisition were agreed upon and announced 
additionally  we reversed million of deferred stock based compensation related to the cancellation of unvested stock options for the year ended december  stock based compensation amounts are based on the excess of the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant or sale over the option exercise price or stock purchase price 
compensation expense related to stock options is amortized over the vesting period of the options  which generally is four years 
we expect to incur stock based compensation expense of approximately million in  million in and million in for common stock issued or stock options awarded to our employees or members of our board of directors through december   under our stock compensation plans and the common stock held in escrow as a result of the interact acquisition 
other data non gaap financial measure we evaluate operating performance based on several factors  including our primary internal financial measure of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and charges ebitda as adjusted 
this analysis eliminates the effects of considerable amounts of depreciation  amortization of goodwill recognized in prior years in 
table of contents connection with our acquisition of contigo software  inc  stock based compensation and the other charges set forth below 
the calculation of adjusted ebitda is as follows in thousands years ended december  net loss add depreciation  amortization and other income expense  net add amortization of goodwill add stock based compensation expense add equity in loss of unconsolidated joint venture add loss on sale of common stock add asset impairment charges add restructuring charges and contract termination expenses ebitda beginning january   we have had a significant reduction or improvement in our net loss because of the issuance of a new accounting standard that eliminates goodwill amortization and replaces this concept with an annual goodwill impairment test 
as indicated in the adjusted ebitda calculation above  we expensed million and million in goodwill amortization in the years ended december  and  respectively 
as a result of this new accounting standard  which became effective january   we are no longer amortizing goodwill and  correspondingly  our net loss has decreased relative to prior periods in which we did expense significant amounts of goodwill amortization 
amortization expense related to goodwill would have been million in the trends depicted by this calculation indicate that we have been successful in significantly reducing both our net loss as well as improving adjusted ebitda  primarily as a result of our efforts to control operating costs while simultaneously increasing revenue 
for the year ended december   as compared with the year ended december   our net loss decreased by million 
for the year ended december   as compared with the year ended december   our adjusted ebitda improved by million 
adjusted ebitda should be considered in addition to  not as a substitute for  net loss and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
ebitda is a measure of operating performance and liquidity that is commonly reported and widely used by analysts  investors and other interested parties because it eliminates significant non cash charges and other charges to earnings and also represents a financial measure used by our bank to determine our compliance with a financial covenant articulated in our loan and security agreement 
in addition  net income excluding such non cash charges may permit investors to better compare results from period to period and to more accurately assess our prospects 
however  adjusted ebitda as used by us may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
the funds depicted by adjusted ebitda are not available for our discretionary use due to debt service  debt maturities and other commitments that we have made 
cash flow calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles is as follows net cash used by operations was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  and net cash provided by operations was million for the year ended december   net cash used by investing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  net cash provided by financing activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  and net cash used by financing activities was million for the year ended december  results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
total revenue increased by million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the addition of new customers  including the customers we acquired as a result of the acquisition of interact in the second quarter of  and was partially offset by pricing pressure we are experiencing for some of our services 
our largest customer  qwest 
table of contents communications  transitioned its use of our web and phone conferencing service to its network in august and this transition decreased our revenue from it for this service as we decreased our price per minute commensurate with our cost of revenue decline 
we also entered into several large web conferencing pro subscription agreements with large telephony carriers in such as qwest and bell canada  which partially explain the increase in non usage based revenue in absolute dollars 
qwest represented of revenue in  despite the transition of web and phone conferencing minutes off of our network 
we expect qwest s percentage of revenue to decrease significantly in the first quarter of due to the expiration of a subscription contract for our web conferencing pro service that has been transitioned to a usage based model 
this transition is expected to reduce our revenue growth over prior quarters in the near term 
since our restructuring announced in january  we have focused on our core web conferencing service offerings 
accordingly  the second quarter of was the final quarter in which revenue was generated from legacy services as we satisfied commitments made to customers 
cost of revenue

maintenance and repairs expense decreased million for the year ended december  from the year ended december  this decrease resulted primarily from the reduction of maintenance costs associated with legacy equipment we took out of service in the second quarter of depreciation expense decreased million for the year ended december  from the year ended december  this decrease resulted primarily from the write down of specific long lived assets to their fair value in the second quarter of the primary reasons for our gross profit improvement are an increase in our subscription based revenue or non usage based revenue  on which we generate higher margins  and a general improvement in our infrastructure utilization

net cash used in investing activities in primarily related to capital expenditures for equipment and software used in our data operations centers  the purchase of stock in a company from which we formerly licensed software and a payment associated with a business acquisition  net of cash acquired 
we moved into our corporate headquarters in louisville  co in late and the majority of the expenditures in were attributable to the build out of our data operations center 
net cash used by investing activities in primarily related to capital expenditures for equipment upgrades and enhancements and decreased significantly over as the majority of funds required to build out our infrastructure were expended in net cash used by investing activities in primarily related to capital expenditures for equipment purchases  as we purchased additional equipment to increase our capacity in conjunction with increases in revenue 
additionally  we paid  net of cash received  million to acquire substantially all of the assets of interact on april  net cash provided by financing activities was and million for each of the years ended december  and  respectively 
net cash used by financing activities was million for the year ended december  cash provided by financing activities in was primarily from the sale of our series e preferred stock and the sale of common stock in our initial public offering  net of payments made under our debt financing arrangements 
cash provided by financing activities in was primarily from the exercise of common stock options and proceeds from our debt financing  net of payments made 
cash used by financing activities in was primarily due to debt service payments offset by cash proceeds from the exercise of common stock options 
as of december   we had approximately million in total debt obligations outstanding  of which approximately million was current 
on october   we entered into a loan and security agreement with a bank that consisted of a million revolving line of credit and a million term loan 
advances under the revolving line of credit bore interest at the bank s prime rate and were limited to million or of eligible accounts receivable as defined in the agreement 
we incurred commitment fees of  which were being amortized over the term of the agreement 
the revolving line of credit was available through february  advances under the revolving line of credit could be repaid and re borrowed at any time prior to the maturity date 
on october  we received million pursuant to the term loan referenced above 
the term loan was to be repaid with monthly principal payments of  plus interest at over months 
effective december   the terms of the loan and security agreement were amended to renew and increase the revolving line of credit and refinance the term loan 
in connection with refinancing the term loan  the current outstanding balance will be repaid with monthly principal payments of  plus interest at over months 
advances under the revolving line of credit are limited to million or of eligible accounts receivable as defined in the agreement 
the revolving line of credit is available through january  advances under the revolving line of credit may be repaid and re borrowed at any time prior to the maturity date 
at december   we did not have an outstanding balance 
table of contents under the revolving line of credit and the additional liquidity available  based on eligible accounts receivable  was million 
the loan and security agreement is collateralized by substantially all of our tangible and intangible assets and is subject to compliance with covenants  including minimum liquidity coverage  minimum quick ratio and maximum quarterly operating losses adjusted for interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and other non cash charges 
we are also prohibited from paying any dividends without the bank s prior written consent 
at december   the balance due under this agreement is approximately million  of which approximately million is current 
we also receive funds from time to time from the exercise of options or similar rights to purchase shares of our common stock 
we have no other material external sources of liquidity 
in the first quarter of our cash and cash equivalents decreased million  in the second quarter of our cash and cash equivalents decreased million  in the third quarter of our cash and cash equivalents increased million and in the fourth quarter of our cash and cash equivalents increased million 
while overall our cash balance decreased million in  we generated positive cash flows from operations for the fifth consecutive quarter 
additionally  we paid  net of cash received  million to acquire interact 
looking ahead we expect our debt service payments to decrease in over and we expect our cash basis capital expenditures to remain relatively flat 
we also expect proceeds from the exercise of common stock options  however  it is not possible to estimate what impact this will have on we obtain a significant portion of our liquidity from operating cash flows 
our customer base consists of a large number of geographically dispersed customers diversified across several industries and none of our customers constituted greater than of our revenue in and in  we recorded sales to qwest communications international  inc  which represented of total revenue 
the receivable due from qwest at december   all of which was current  was million or of our total accounts receivable balance 
our operating cash flows could be adversely affected in the event qwest experiences financial difficulties that affect its ability to pay us in a timely fashion 
we expect qwest s revenue contribution to decrease below of our total revenue in the first quarter of  primarily as a result of a transition by qwest from a subscription contract for our web conferencing pro service to a usage based contract 
in the third quarter of the board of directors of evoke communications europe unanimously approved a plan of liquidation and dissolution and  as a result  evoke communications europe is being liquidated and its operations have ceased 
in connection with the liquidation and dissolution  we received cash of approximately million in at december   the liquidation and dissolution was substantially complete and  as a result  we expect significantly less cash distributions in as of december   our purchase commitments for bandwidth usage and telephony services were approximately million and will be expended over the next three years 
some of these agreements may be amended to either increase or decrease the minimum commitments during the lives of the contract 
we lease office facilities under various operating leases that expire through a large number of these facilities are satellite sales offices that typically average  square feet 
total future minimum lease payments  under all operating leases  as of december  are approximately million 
we are in the process of attempting to sublease or otherwise minimize our lease commitments with respect to three offices  and to the extent we are successful in subleasing or otherwise relieving ourselves of the lease obligations  these facility lease commitments  net of any subleases  will decrease 
through december   we have been successful in terminating four facility leases  thereby relieving ourselves of any future obligation  and we have been successful in subleasing seven facilities 
future minimum sublease receivables for the seven subleased facilities  as of december   approximate million that we expect to receive through august our contractual obligations and commitments to make future payments as of december  are as follows in thousands 
table of contents payments due by period total less than year years years over years long term debt operating leases purchase obligations total contractual obligations and commitments we expect that existing cash resources and our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months 
we expect our cash flows will continue to improve and will eventually enable us to consistently maintain positive cash flows from operations  and that existing cash reserves will therefore be sufficient to meet our capital requirements during this period 
we base our expenses and expenditures in part on our expectations of future revenue levels 
if our revenue for a particular period is lower than expected  we may take steps to reduce our operating expenses accordingly 
if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional public or private equity securities or obtain additional debt financing 
additional financing may not be available at all or  if available  may not be obtainable on terms favorable to us 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned technology and product development and sales and marketing efforts  which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
additional financing may also be dilutive to our existing stockholders 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant estimates are used in these financial statements to determine the allowance for doubtful accounts  useful lives of depreciable and intangible assets  the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets and restructuring charges and reserves 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition revenue for our web and phone conferencing service is generally based upon the actual time that each participant is on the phone or logged onto the web 
for example  a customer is charged a per minute  per user fee for each participant listening and viewing a live or recorded simulcast 
in addition  we charge customers a one time fee to upload visuals for a phone conference or a recorded simulcast 
we recognize usage revenue from our web and phone conferencing services as soon as a call or simulcast of a call is completed 
we recognize revenue associated with any initial set up fees ratably over the term of the contract 
revenue for our web conferencing pro service is derived from a concurrent user and usage fee in addition to event fees or  in more limited cases  a software license fee 
revenue from concurrent user fees is recognized monthly regardless of usage  while usage fees are based upon either monthly connections or minutes used 
event fees are generally hourly charges that are recognized as the events take place 
we recognize revenue associated with any initial set up fees ratably over the term of the contract 
revenue from software license agreements is recognized upon shipment of the software when all the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  collectibility is probable  and vendor specific objective evidence is available for the fair value of all undelivered elements 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations and continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while our doubtful accounts have historically been within our 
table of contents expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience doubtful accounts at the same rate as we have in the past 
our accounts receivable is currently diverse and is comprised of numerous customers geographically dispersed across many different industries 
in  we recorded sales to qwest communications international  inc  which represented of total revenue 
the receivable due from qwest at december   all of which was current  was million or of our total accounts receivable balance 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of one of our larger customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of our accounts receivables and future operating results 
long lived assets and their impairment effective january   we adopted sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
under sfas  long lived assets  other than goodwill  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets might not be recoverable 
conditions that would necessitate an impairment assessment include a significant decline in the observable market value of an asset  a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used  or a significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets is not recoverable 
for long lived assets to be held and used  we recognize an impairment loss only if its carrying amount is not recoverable through its undiscounted cash flows and we measure the impairment loss based on the difference between the carrying amount and fair value 
long lived assets held for sale are reported at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell 
in  we identified and removed from service equipment that was no longer required or had become obsolete 
the asset write offs were determined under the long lived assets to be disposed of by sale model described above 
we expect to complete the sale and disposal of the assets in the first half of in connection with the plan of disposal  the carrying amount of the assets exceeded the fair value of the assets less costs to sell  and as a result  we recorded an impairment loss of  in the fourth quarter of goodwill effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas which requires that purchased goodwill and certain indefinite lived intangibles no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually 
sfas requires a two phase approach for impairment testing of goodwill 
the first phase screens for impairment  while the second phase if necessary measures the impairment 
we completed our first phase impairment analysis and did not find indication of impairment of our recorded goodwill  accordingly  the second testing phase was not necessary in in assessing the recoverability of goodwill  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and profitability to determine fair value 
the valuation techniques that we consider include a weighted average multiple of revenue  a weighted average multiple of cash flow  our stock market capitalization and the book value of our assets 
our stock has been and continues to be volatile and subsequent to december   our market capitalization has decreased significantly 
we do not believe market capitalization alone  particularly given the volatility in our stock price  is a good indicator of impairment 
as such  we will continue to monitor the volatility in our stock price and the resulting market capitalization  as well as all of our other impairment indicators  and will continue to assess their collective impact on our recorded goodwill 
if our estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record charges for impairment of goodwill in the future and there can be no assurances that our goodwill will not be impaired in the future 
in  we recorded million in goodwill as a result of our acquisition of interact conferencing 
at december   we had approximately million in goodwill subject to the impairment testing provisions of sfas income tax valuation allowances we have recorded a valuation allowance equal to our deferred tax asset 
we have not generated taxable income and until we do so for a reasonable period of time we expect to continue to provide a valuation allowance for of our deferred tax assets 
when we determine that we will be able to utilize some or all of our deferred tax benefits  we will record an asset that will increase net income in the period in which such determination is made 
our deferred tax asset at december  is approximately million 
at december   we had a net operating loss carry forward of approximately million  which is available to offset future taxable income through 
table of contents restructuring reserves at december   our restructuring reserves totaled million and solely relate to facility costs 
the restructuring reserve will be relieved by payments we make  net of our sub tenants rent payments to us for all sub leased offices 
the facility reserve will increase or decrease based on our ability to sublease vacant spaces  which are under non cancelable operating leases expiring at various dates through as of december   the facility reserve was comprised of three offices 
currently  the minimum lease payments for the three offices total approximately  per month 
we have fully reserved two of the remaining offices because the offices are anticipated to remain vacant and the leases expire in the first half of as a result  barring a default by a subtenant on an existing sublease only one office can subject us to future restructuring charges 
due to the current real estate market  it has taken us longer than expected to sub lease or otherwise terminate our lease obligations in certain cities 
however  we continually monitor and adjust  as warranted  our restructuring reserve associated with remote sales facilities based on current facts and circumstances 
if we are able to sublease or otherwise terminate a lease obligation on terms more favorable than we currently have projected  we will adjust the reserve accordingly and increase income in the quarter the adjustment is made 
if we are unable to reduce or eliminate our commitment on the one remaining office that is not fully reserved in a timely fashion  we will make unfavorable adjustments to the restructuring reserve and record expense in the quarter the adjustments are made 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for exit or disposal activities 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies eitf issue  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred instead of the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
this statement also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
severance pay under statement  in many cases  would be recognized over time rather than upfront for employees who render future services beyond a minimum retention period 
the minimum retention period would be based on the legal notification period  or if there is no such requirement  days 
the provisions of sfas are effective for the company for disposal activities initiated after december  management does not believe adoption of this statement will have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement sfas amends fasb  accounting for stock based compensation to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of statement to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the provisions of sfas are effective for the company in fiscal and in fiscal for certain disclosures 
management does not believe the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows as the company does not plan to change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 

table of contents additional risk factors that may affect our operating results and the market price of our common stock you should carefully consider the risks described below 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
in that case  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
you should not rely on forward looking statements because they are inherently uncertain 
this document contains certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
we use words such as anticipate  believe  expect  future  intend  plan and similar expressions to identify forward looking statements 
these statements are only predictions 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward looking statements are reasonable  we cannot guarantee future results  levels of activity  performance or achievements 
you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which apply only as of the date of this document 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including the risks faced by us and described on the following pages and elsewhere in this document 
we assume no obligation to update the forward looking statements included in this document 
we believe it is important to communicate our expectations to our investors 
however  there may be events in the future that we are not able to predict accurately or over which we have no control 
the risk factors listed below  as well as any cautionary language in this document  provide examples of risks  uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations we describe in our forward looking statements 
before you invest in our common stock  you should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in these risk factors and elsewhere in this document could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  financial condition and stock price 
we have a history of losses and we may not sustain profitability 
our operating costs have exceeded our revenue in each quarter since our inception in april  except for the quarter ended december  if we do not sustain profitability in the future  we may be unable to continue our operations 
we have incurred cumulative net losses of approximately million from our inception through december  and we may have additional net losses in our revenue may not continue to grow and  as a result  we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future 
in addition  we expect to incur significant sales and marketing  research and development  and general and administrative expenses in the future 
accordingly  we must significantly increase our revenue to maintain profitability and to continue our operations 
we have a limited operating history  which makes it difficult to evaluate our business 
we have a limited operating history and you should not rely on our recent results as an indication of our future performance 
we were incorporated in april and first recorded revenue in january we only began commercially offering our web and phone conferencing service in april and our web conferencing pro service in june in january  we restructured our company to focus solely on these services 
in connection with this restructuring  we made significant changes to our services and growth strategies  our sales and marketing plans  and other operational matters  including a significant reduction in our employee base 
as a result  we have a limited relevant operating history and it may be difficult to evaluate an investment in our company  and we cannot be certain that our business model and future operating performance will yield the results that we intend 
in addition  the rapidly changing nature of the web conferencing market makes it difficult or impossible for us to predict future results  and you should not expect our future revenue growth to equal or exceed our recent growth rates 
our business strategy may be unsuccessful and we may be unable to address the risks we face in a cost effective manner  if at all 
we may fail to meet market expectations because of fluctuations in our quarterly operating results  which would cause our stock price to decline 
as a result of our limited operating history  increased competition  the rapidly changing market for our services and the other risks described in this section  our quarterly operating results have varied significantly from period to period in the past and are likely to continue to vary significantly in future periods 
for example  our quarterly net income loss ranged between million net loss and million net income in the four quarters ended december  our quarterly revenue ranged between million and million in the four quarters ended 
table of contents december  many of the factors that may cause fluctuations in our quarterly operating results are beyond our control  such as increased competition and market demand for our services 
as a result of these factors and other risks described in this section  our quarterly operating results are difficult to predict and may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
if this occurs  the price of our common stock would decline 
additionally  we expect our results will fluctuate based on seasonal sales patterns 
our operating results have shown decreases in our usage based services around the spring  summer  thanksgiving  december and new year holidays 
we expect that our revenue during these seasons will not grow at the same rates as compared to other periods of the year because of decreased use of our services by business customers 
we depend on single source suppliers for key components of our infrastructure and a limited number of sources for telephony services  the loss of which could cause significant delays and increased costs in providing services to our existing and prospective customers 
we purchase key components of our telephony hardware infrastructure from a single supplier 
any extended reduction  interruption or discontinuation in the supply of these components would cause significant delays and increased costs in providing services to our existing and prospective customers 
these components form the basis of our audio conferencing infrastructure  upon which the majority of our services rely 
in order to continue to expand our infrastructure capacity  we must purchase additional components from this supplier 
because we do not have any guaranteed supply arrangements with this supplier  it may unilaterally increase its prices for these components  and as a result  we could face higher than expected operating costs and impaired operating results 
in addition  this supplier could cease supplying us with these components 
we also have a limited number of sources for our telephony services  which constitute the transport for our audio conferencing infrastructure  upon which the majority of our services rely 
one of these suppliers on which we are substantially dependent for telephony services is worldcom  which filed for chapter bankruptcy protection in july if this supplier was to terminate or interrupt its services  we would experience difficulties in obtaining alternative sources on commercially reasonable terms  if at all  or in integrating alternative sources into our technology platform 
in addition  if we were required to obtain these services from alternative sources  we expect that our cost of sales would substantially increase 
we also rely on a single supplier for the majority of our storage hardware  which store critical operations data and maintain the reliability of our services 
if we are required to find alternative sources for such equipment  we may experience difficulty in integrating them into our infrastructure and we could be required to expend significant money and resources 
a high percentage of our revenue is attributable to repeat customers  including qwest communications international  inc  none of whom are obligated to continue to use our services 
the failure of continued use of our services by existing customers could harm our operating results and cause our stock price to decline 
a high percentage of our revenue is attributable to repeat customer usage of our services 
our customers are not obligated to continue to use our services as we provide our services largely on a usage based model 
in addition  customers have no obligation to renew subscription contracts with us 
as a result  our inability to retain existing customers and sustain or increase their usage of our services could result in lower than expected revenue  and therefore  harm our ability to sustain profitability on a consistent basis and cause our stock price to decline 
in addition  because many of our customers have no continuing obligations with us  we may face increased downward pricing pressure that could cause a decrease in our gross margins 
our customers depend on the reliability of our services and we may lose a customer if we fail to provide reliable services for even a single communication event 
additionally  we target our services to large companies  including large telecommunications companies  and as a result  we may experience an increase in customer concentration 
in particular  during the year ended december   we recorded sales to qwest communications international  inc  which represented of total revenue  which subjects us to a number of risks  including a credit risk that we may not be paid a material portion of outstanding current or future accounts receivables from this customer 
the receivable due from qwest at december   all of which was current  was approximately million or of the company s total accounts receivable balance 
in addition  our top five customers accounted for of our revenue in if any of these large customers stop using our services or are unable to pay their debts as they become due  our operating results will be harmed  our revenue will be negatively impacted  and our ability to sustain profitability on a consistent basis could be harmed 

table of contents our business and operating results may suffer if we fail to establish distribution relationships or if our distribution partners do not successfully market and sell our services 
for the year ended december   of our revenue was attributable to our indirect customers 
these customers may not be obligated to distribute our services through their sales channels 
in addition  these customers may not be obligated to continue to use our services or renew any subscription agreements with us 
as a result  we cannot anticipate the amount of revenue we will derive from these relationships in the future 
our inability to retain these customers and sustain or increase their distribution of our services could result in significant reductions in our revenue  and therefore  harm our ability to sustain profitability on a consistent basis 
if we fail to establish new distribution relationships in a timely manner or if our distribution partners do not successfully distribute our services  our ability to achieve widespread adoption for our services will suffer and our business and operating results will be harmed 
establishing these distribution relationships can take several months or more 
additionally  it typically takes several months or longer before our distribution arrangements generate revenue 
our distribution partners are not prohibited from offering and reselling the products and services of our competitors and may choose to devote greater resources to marketing and supporting the products and services of our competitors 
the growth of our business substantially depends on our ability to successfully develop and introduce new services and features in a timely manner 
our growth depends on our ability to develop leading edge web conferencing services and features 
for example  in  we intend to commercially release our next generation web conferencing service and technology 
we may not successfully identify  develop and market this next generation service and features in a timely and cost effective manner 
if the services and features we develop fail to achieve widespread market acceptance or fail to generate significant revenue to offset development costs  our net losses will increase and we may not be able to sustain profitability on a consistent basis 
in addition  our ability to introduce new services and features may depend on us acquiring technologies or forming relationships with third parties and we may be unable to identify suitable candidates or come to terms acceptable to us for any such acquisition or relationship 
we also may not be able to successfully alter the design of our systems to quickly integrate new technologies 
in addition  we have experienced development delays and cost overruns in our development efforts in the past and we may encounter these problems in the future 
delays and cost overruns could affect our ability to respond to technological changes  evolving industry standards  competitive developments or customer requirements 
competition in the web conferencing services market is intense and we may be unable to compete successfully  particularly as a result of recent announcements from large software companies 
the market for web conferencing services is relatively new  rapidly evolving and intensely competitive 
competition in our market will continue to intensify and may force us to reduce our prices  or cause us to experience reduced sales and margins  loss of market share and reduced acceptance of our services 
recently  microsoft announced its intention to acquire placeware  a private company offering web conferencing services 
in addition  some large software providers  such as oracle and ibm  have announced their intention to provide web conferencing services in addition to their software offerings 
many of our current and potential competitors have larger and more established customer bases  longer operating histories  greater name recognition  broader service offerings  more employees and significantly greater financial  technical  marketing  public relations and distribution resources than we do 
as a result  these competitors may be able to spread costs across diversified lines of business  and therefore  adopt aggressive strategies  such as reduced pricing structures and large scale marketing campaigns  that reduce our ability to compete effectively 
telecommunication providers  for example  enjoy lower per minute long distance costs as a result of their ownership of the underlying telecommunication network 
we expect that many more companies will enter this market and invest significant resources to develop web conferencing services 
these current and future competitors may also offer or develop products or services that perform better than ours 
in addition  acquisitions or strategic partnerships involving our current and potential competitors could harm us in a number of ways 
for example 
table of contents competitors could acquire or partner with companies with which we have distribution relationships and discontinue our partnership  resulting in the loss of distribution opportunities for our services  a competitor could be acquired by or enter into a strategic relationship with a party that has greater resources and experience than we do  such as the microsoft placeware acquisition  thereby increasing the ability of the competitor to compete with our services  or a competitor could acquire or partner with one of our key suppliers 
if we fail to offer competitive pricing  we may not be able to attract and retain customers 
because the web conferencing market is relatively new and still evolving  the prices for these services are subject to rapid and frequent changes 
in many cases  businesses provide their services at significantly reduced rates  for free or on a trial basis in order to win customers 
due to competitive factors and the rapidly changing marketplace  we may be required to significantly reduce our pricing structure  which would negatively affect our revenue  margins and our ability to sustain profitability on a consistent basis 
our sales cycle makes it difficult to predict our quarterly operating results 
our sales cycle varies from several weeks to several months depending on the type and size of customer approached 
oftentimes  potential customers require approvals from multiple decision makers within their organizations 
in addition  since most of our services are provided on a usage based pricing model  it generally takes several weeks or months before our services are ramped for use within an organization 
these variables make it difficult for us to predict if and when our services will be adopted and used by our customers 
as a result  our quarterly operating results are difficult to predict 
our business will suffer if our systems fail or become unavailable 
a reduction in the performance  reliability or availability of our systems will harm our ability to provide our services to our users  as well as harm our reputation 
some of our customers have experienced interruptions in our services in the past due to service or network outages  periodic system upgrades and internal system failures 
similar interruptions may occur from time to time in the future 
because our revenue depends largely on the number of users and the amount of minutes consumed by users  our business will suffer if we experience frequent or extended system interruptions 
we maintain our primary data facility and hosting servers at our headquarters in louisville  colorado  and a secondary data facility in denver  colorado 
our operations depend on our ability to protect these facilities and our systems against damage or interruption from fire  power loss  water  telecommunications failure  vandalism  sabotage and similar unexpected events 
in addition  a sudden and significant increase in traffic on our systems or infrastructure could strain the capacity of the software  hardware and systems that we use 
this could lead to slower response times or system failures 
the occurrence of any of the foregoing risks could cause service interruptions and  as a result  materially harm our reputation  negatively affect our revenue  and our ability to sustain profitability on a consistent basis 
our services are often used to share confidential and sensitive information and  as a result  if our security system is breached  our business and reputation could suffer 
we must securely receive and transmit confidential information for our customers over public networks and maintain that information on internal systems 
our failure to prevent security breaches could damage our reputation  and expose us to risk of loss or liability 
if we fail to provide adequate security measures to protect the confidential information of our customers  our customers may refrain from using our services or potential customers may not choose to use our services  and as a result  our operating results would be harmed 
our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses  physical or electronic break ins and similar disruptions  which could lead to interruptions  delays or loss of data 
we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by any breach 
in addition  our internal systems are accessible to a number of our employees 
although each of these employees is subject to a confidentiality agreement  we may be unable to prevent the misappropriation of this information 

table of contents if we do not increase the capacity of our infrastructure in excess of customer demand  customers may experience service problems and choose not to use our services 
the amount of conferencing events we host has increased significantly 
we must continually increase our capacity consistent with our growth in usage 
we generally maintain capacity based on average usage 
to accommodate increased customer usage and rapidly expand our operations requires a significant increase in the capacity of our infrastructure 
to increase capacity  we may need to order equipment with substantial development and manufacturing lead times  which can sometimes be several months or longer 
if we fail to increase our capacity in a timely and efficient manner  customers may experience service problems  such as busy signals  improperly routed conferences  and interruptions in service 
service problems such as these would harm our reputation  cause us to lose customers and decrease our revenue  and therefore our ability to sustain profitability on a consistent basis 
conversely  if we overestimate our capacity needs  we will pay for more capacity than we actually use  resulting in increased costs without a corresponding increase in revenue  which would harm our operating results 
our failure to manage growth could cause substantial increases in our operating costs and harm our ability to sustain profitability on a consistent basis and  therefore  decrease the value of our stock 
despite our restructuring in january  which resulted in  among other things  a significant reduction in the size of our workforce  we have rapidly expanded since inception  and will continue to expand our operations and infrastructure 
this expansion has placed  and will continue to place  a significant strain on our managerial  operational and financial resources and we may not effectively manage this growth 
rapidly expanding our business would require us to invest significant amounts of capital in our operations and resources  which would substantially increase our operating costs 
as a result  our failure to manage our growth effectively could cause substantial increases in our operating costs without corresponding increases in our revenue  thereby harming our ability to sustain profitability on a consistent basis 
also  our management may have to divert a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day to day activities and devote a substantial amount of time to managing growth 
in order to rapidly expand our business we may need to raise additional funds 
any future financing we require may not be available on a timely basis  in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us 
if we cannot obtain adequate funds  we may not be able to compete effectively 
our joint venture with viso limited was not successful and any additional international expansion may not be successful  which could harm our ability to attract multi national customers and cause our operating losses to increase 
we have attempted to expand into international markets and spent significant financial and managerial resources to do so 
in particular  we formed a joint venture with viso limited  a european based venture capital firm  to expand our operations to continental europe and the united kingdom 
currently  this joint venture is in the process of being liquidated and will be dissolved 
this decision may harm our strategy to expand internationally and attract multi national customers 
further  we will not realize the value from the costs associated with starting up this venture 
in addition  we have  and may continue to  expend significant costs  resources and time to execute this dissolution and liquidation 
as a result  our operating results may be harmed and we may not sustain profitability on a consistent basis  thereby causing our stock price to decline 
if we continue to expand internationally  either alone or with a partner  we would be required to spend additional financial and managerial resources that may be significant 
we have limited experience in international operations and may not be able to compete effectively in international markets 
we face certain risks inherent in conducting business internationally  such as difficulties in establishing and maintaining distribution channels and partners for our services  varying technology standards from country to country  uncertain protection of intellectual property rights  inconsistent regulations and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  difficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations  
table of contents linguistic and cultural differences  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods  imposition of currency exchange controls  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
in addition  our expansion into international markets may require us to develop specific technology that will allow our current systems to work with international telephony systems 
we may not develop this technology in a timely manner  in a way to prevent service disruptions or at all 
we are not experienced in managing facilities  people and operations in geographically diverse areas  which we now are required to do as a result of the acquisition of interact conferencing  llc 
as a result of our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of interact conferencing  we have operations in multiple facilities in geographically diverse areas 
in particular  we have expanded our sales force in connection with the acquisition and have transitioned the management of the sales force to the former chief executive officer of interact  located in our georgia facility 
we are not experienced in managing facilities  people and operations in geographically diverse areas 
we may not sustain the financial results that interact has achieved in the past because of integration problems  changes that we have made to interact s operations and the potential loss of customers who may decide not to continue their relationship with us 
we may acquire other businesses  form joint ventures and make investments in other companies that could negatively affect our operations and financial results and dilute existing stockholders 
the pursuit of additional business relationships through acquisitions  joint ventures  or other investment prospects may not be successful  and we may not realize the benefits of any acquisition  joint venture  or other investment 
we have limited experience in acquisition activities and may have to devote substantial time and resources in order to complete acquisitions 
there may also be risks of entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience 
further  these potential acquisitions  joint ventures and investments entail risks  uncertainties and potential disruptions to our business 
for example  we may not be able to successfully integrate a company s operations  technologies  products and services  information systems and personnel into our business 
an acquisition may further strain our existing financial and managerial controls  and divert management s attention away from our other business concerns 
there may also be unanticipated costs associated with an acquisition that may harm our operating results and key personnel may decide not to work for us 
these risks could harm our operating results and cause our stock price to decline 
in addition  if we were to make any acquisitions  we could issue equity securities that would dilute our stockholders  expend cash  incur debt  assume unknown or contingent liabilities  or experience negative effects on our results of operations 

table of contents our web and phone conferencing service may become subject to traditional telecommunications carrier regulation by federal and state authorities  which would increase the cost of providing our services and may subject us to penalties 
we believe our web and phone conferencing service is not subject to regulation by the federal communications commission fcc or any state public service commission because the services integrate traditional voice teleconferencing and added value internet services 
the fcc and state public service commissions  however  may require us to submit to traditional telecommunications carrier regulations for our web and phone conferencing service under the communications act of  as amended  and various state laws or regulations as a provider of telecommunications services 
if the fcc or any state public service commission seeks to enforce any of these laws or regulations against us  we could be prohibited from providing the voice aspect of our web and phone conferencing service until we have obtained various federal and state licenses and filed tariffs 
we believe we would be able to obtain those licenses  although in some states  doing so could significantly delay our ability to provide services 
we also would be required to comply with other aspects of federal and state laws and regulations 
subjecting our web and phone conferencing service to these laws and regulations would increase our operating costs  could require restructuring of those services to charge separately for the voice and internet components  and would involve on going reporting and other compliance obligations 
we also might be subject to fines or forfeitures and civil or criminal penalties for non compliance 
our competitors may be able to create systems with similar functionality to ours and third parties may obtain unauthorized use of our intellectual property 
the success of our business is substantially dependent on the proprietary systems that we have developed 
to protect our intellectual property rights  we currently rely on a combination of trademarks  service marks  trade secrets  copyrights  and confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties  and protective contractual provisions 
we also own three patents relating to features of our web conferencing pro service 
these measures may not be adequate to safeguard the technology underlying our web conferencing services and other intellectual property 
unauthorized third parties may copy or infringe upon aspects of our technology  services or other intellectual property 
other than the patents that we own  our proprietary systems are not currently protected by any patents and we may not be successful in our efforts to secure patents for our proprietary systems 
regardless of our efforts to protect our intellectual property  our competitors and others may be able to develop similar systems and services without infringing on any of our intellectual property rights 
in addition  employees  consultants and others who participate in the development of our proprietary systems and services may breach their agreements with us regarding our intellectual property and we may not have any adequate remedies 
furthermore  the validity  enforceability and scope of protection for intellectual property such as ours in internet related industries are uncertain and still evolving 
we also may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights in certain countries 
in addition  our trade secrets may become known through other means not currently foreseen by us 
if we resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights  the proceedings could be burdensome and expensive and the outcome could be uncertain 
we may be subject to claims alleging intellectual property infringement 
we may be subject to claims alleging that we have infringed upon third party intellectual property rights 
claims of this nature could require us to spend significant amounts of time and money to defend ourselves  regardless of their merit 
if any of these claims were to prevail  we could be forced to pay damages  comply with injunctions  divert management attention and resources  or halt or delay distribution of our services while we reengineer them or seek licenses to necessary intellectual property  which might not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
as the number of competitors in our market grows  there is an increased risk that the proprietary systems and software upon which our services rely may be increasingly subject to third party infringement claims 
if any of the third party services that we use become unavailable to us  our services would be subject to significant delays and increased costs 
we rely on third party services  such as internet access  transport and long distance providers 
these companies may not continue to provide services to us without disruptions  at the current cost  or at all 
the costs associated with a transition to a new service provider would be substantial 
we may be required to reengineer our systems and infrastructure to accommodate a new service provider  which would be both expensive and time consuming 
in addition  in the past  we have experienced disruptions and delays in our services due to service disruptions from these providers 
any interruption in the delivery of our services would likely cause a loss of revenue and a loss of customers 

table of contents our business may be harmed if our services do not work with the various hardware and software systems  including corporate security measures  used by our customers 
we currently provide services to customers with various hardware and software systems  ranging from legacy to next generation applications and networking equipment 
if our services are unable to support these diverse platforms  and if we fail to modify our services to support new versions of these applications and equipment  our services may fail to gain broad market acceptance  which would cause our operating results to suffer 
furthermore  because of bandwidth constraints on corporate intranets and concerns about security  our customers and potential customers may block reception of web services like ours within their corporate environments 
in order for customers to use our services  customers and users may need to reconfigure their corporate intranets  security measures and firewalls 
widespread adoption of our technology and services depends on overcoming these obstacles 
our web conferencing services will not generate significant revenue if businesses do not switch from traditional teleconferencing and communication services to web conferencing 
if businesses do not switch from traditional teleconferencing and communication services  our services will not generate significant revenue 
businesses that have already invested substantial resources in traditional or other methods of communication may be reluctant to adopt new web conferencing services 
if sufficient demand for our services does not develop  we will have difficulty selling our services and generating significant increases in revenue 
as a result  we would not sustain profitability on a consistent basis and the price of our common stock would decline 
growth in revenue from our services will depend in part on an increase in the number of customers using the web based features in addition to our traditional conferencing features 
we disclose non gaap financial information 
we prepare and release quarterly unaudited and annual audited financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
we also disclose and discuss certain non gaap financial information in the related earnings release and investor conference call 
this non gaap financial information excludes certain non cash expenses and other charges  consisting primarily of depreciation  the amortization of intangible assets  stock based compensation and restructuring costs 
we believe the disclosure of non gaap financial information helps investors more meaningfully evaluate the results of our operations 
however  we urge investors to carefully review the gaap financial information included as part of our quarterly reports on form q  our annual reports on form k  and our quarterly earnings releases and compare that gaap financial information with the non gaap financial results disclosed in our quarterly earnings releases and investor calls 
we are subject to risks associated with governmental regulation and legal uncertainties 
it is likely that a number of laws and regulations may be adopted in the united states and other countries with respect to the internet that might affect us 
these laws may relate to areas such as changes in telecommunications regulations  copyright and other intellectual property rights  encryption  personal privacy concerns  including the use of cookies and individual user information  e commerce liability  and email  network and information security 
changes in telecommunications regulations could substantially increase the costs of communicating on the internet 
this  in turn  could slow the growth in internet use and thereby decrease the demand for our services 
several telecommunications carriers are advocating that the federal communications commission regulate the internet in the same manner as other telecommunications services by imposing access fees on internet service providers 
recent events suggest that the fcc may begin regulating the internet in such a way 
in addition  we operate our services 
table of contents throughout the united states and state regulatory authorities may seek to regulate aspects of our services as telecommunication activities 
other countries and political organizations are likely to impose or favor more and different regulations than those that have been proposed in the united states  thus furthering the complexity of regulation 
the adoption of such laws or regulations  and uncertainties associated with their validity and enforcement  may affect the available distribution channels for and costs associated with our services  and may affect the growth of the internet 
such laws or regulations may therefore harm our business 
we may be subject to assessment of sales and other taxes for the sale of our services  license of technology or provision of services  for which we have not accounted 
we may have to pay past sales or other taxes that we have not collected from our customers 
we do not currently collect sales or other taxes on the sale of our services 
our business would be harmed if one or more states or any foreign country were to require us to collect sales or other taxes from current or past sales of services  particularly because we would be unable to go back to customers to collect sales taxes for past sales and may have to pay such taxes out of our own funds 
our stock price is volatile and this volatility may depress our stock price 
the stock market in general  and the stock price of our company in particular  has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
this volatility is often unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance 
these broad market and industry factors may reduce our stock price  regardless of our operating performance 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   we had long term debt  including current portion  in the aggregate amount of million with an interest rate of with payments due through january a change in interest rates would not affect our obligations related to long term debt existing as of december   as the interest payments related to that debt are fixed over the term of the debt 
at december   we had a million revolving line of credit with a loan value of million based on of the underlying eligible accounts receivable at year end 
advances under the revolving line of credit will reflect interest at the bank s prime rate and therefore any advances under this revolving line of credit would subject us to interest rate fluctuations 
increases in interest rates could  however  increase the interest expense associated with future borrowings including any advances on our revolving line of credit 
we are exposed to foreign currency risks through a receivable from our european joint venture which is payable in euros 
we do not employ any risk mitigation techniques with respect to this advance 
our european joint venture is in the process of dissolution and liquidation and our foreign currency risk with respect to the loan will be eliminated when these processes are completed 
although we do not have any investments at december   we may purchase investments that may decline in value as a result of changes in equity markets and interest rates
