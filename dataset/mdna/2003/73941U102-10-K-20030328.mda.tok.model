item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors affecting the company s prospects 
we do not intend to update any of these factors or to publicly announce the results of any revisions to these forward looking statements 
part i item business overview we are a pharmaceutical development company committed to building a portfolio of product candidates with significant commercial potential 
our initial focus is the multi billion dollar global migraine market  where we believe we have the largest portfolio of product candidates currently in development 
we have three product candidates  which combined have over billion in market potential 
in addition  we intend to leverage our pharmaceutical product development expertise by acquiring  in licensing and or developing commercially attractive products in therapeutic areas outside of migraine 
we plan to enter into collaborations with established pharmaceutical or pharmaceutical services companies to commercialize and manufacture our product candidates 
alternatively  we may elect to develop sales and distribution capabilities internally in order to commercialize one or more of our product candidates 
in certain instances  we may also promote our products in collaboration with other pharmaceutical companies 
we have had and expect to continue to have discussions with third parties with respect to the commercialization of our product candidates 
mt is being developed as an oral  first line treatment for migraine pain and associated symptoms 
we have completed all planned phase pivotal clinical trials for mt  which consistently demonstrated mt s effectiveness in treating migraine pain 
in october  we submitted a marketing authorization application maa for mt to the medicines control agency mca in the united kingdom uk 
if approved in the uk  we will seek approval in selected european countries through the european union mutual recognition procedure 
we plan to submit a new drug application nda to the us food and drug administration fda for mt in mid  and complete the nda submission by submitting final carcinogenicity data in early mt  a proprietary formulation of injectable dihydroergotamine mesylate dhe in a pre filled syringe  is being developed to provide long lasting pain relief for patients needing a convenient injectable therapy for severe migraine attacks 
we have completed all planned phase pivotal clinical trials for mt  which consistently demonstrated mt s effectiveness in treating migraine pain 
in december  we submitted an nda to the fda for mt mt is being developed as a co active acute migraine therapy  combining the activity of a triptan with that of a long lasting non steroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid 
we have completed a patient phase clinical trial in which mt showed statistically significant superiority over placebo and its components  including an oral triptan  on the identified primary and secondary outcome measures 

table of contents business strategy the principal elements of our business strategy are to develop and commercialize our portfolio of product candidates a substantial portion of our efforts over the next few years will be devoted to the further development  approval and commercialization of our portfolio of product candidates 
we conduct clinical trials and other studies with our product candidates in order to obtain marketing approvals that will allow us to provide new therapeutic alternatives for migraine patients 
we will need to establish sales and distribution capabilities  either through arrangements with others or by developing them internally  in order to commercialize our products 
in certain instances  we may promote our products in collaboration with other pharmaceutical companies 
build a product pipeline through innovation  in licensing and acquisition we intend to build our product pipeline through innovation  in licensing and or acquisition of select proprietary product candidates 
we will focus primarily on therapeutic areas with significant commercial potential in which members of our management team have development expertise 
these areas of expertise include gastrointestinal disease  respiratory disease  infectious disease and pain 
we plan to develop a pipeline of novel products that exhibit distinct advantages over currently marketed products  as well as innovative combinations of products in convenient  therapeutically appropriate formulations 
leverage development efforts through strategic outsourcing while maintaining overall control of the planning  development and regulatory processes  we seek to enter into strategic outsourcing relationships to develop and commercialize our product candidates in a cost effective manner 
we have contracted and plan to contract with third parties for product candidate testing  development and manufacturing 
migraine market migraine is characterized by recurring attacks of headache  often associated with visual  auditory or gastrointestinal disturbances 
while the precise mechanism of migraine is unknown  researchers believe migraine attacks are caused by acute inflammation surrounding selected blood vessels in the head 
the average migraine sufferer experiences the first attack during the early teen years  and the attacks generally continue throughout adulthood 
it is estimated that global sales of prescription pharmaceuticals for the treatment of migraine will approach billion by not all migraine attacks are of the same severity 
consequently  a variety of oral  injectable and intranasal therapies are used to treat different types of migraine attacks 
many patients use a personal  individually developed  step care approach to treat their attacks 
attacks are often treated initially with simple over the counter analgesics  particularly if the patient is unable to determine if the attack is a migraine or some other type of headache 
if over the counter remedies are unsuccessful  patients often turn to more potent prescription drugs  including narcotics  analgesic narcotic drug combinations and triptans 
triptans are the family of drugs most commonly prescribed for the treatment of migraine attacks 
triptans have demonstrated the ability to treat migraines by constricting blood vessels in the brain 
although triptans can be effective in treating migraine symptoms  they are often associated with significant side effects and other disadvantages that include the occurrence of cardiovascular related events  including chest pain discomfort  throat discomfort and warm cold sensations  the potential for serious cardiovascular events  including death  difficulty in producing sustained benefits with a single dose in a majority of patients  the occurrence of nausea and dizziness during treatment  and the need for cardiovascular evaluations from physicians before initially prescribing triptans to patients with cardiovascular disease risk factors 

table of contents despite these shortcomings  in  according to ims health s retail and provider perspective  or ims  total triptan sales in the us were approximately billion 
imitrex  marketed by glaxosmithkline  is the leading triptan product  with  according to ims  total us sales of approximately billion in there are currently three triptan formulations commercially available oral  intranasal and injectable 
oral triptans are often prescribed as a first line treatment for migraine pain 
intranasal triptans are often prescribed for patients requiring faster relief than oral drugs can provide or for patients who cannot take oral medications 
for the most severe attacks  patients sometimes use an injectable form of a triptan 
because of the problems associated with triptans  and various problems associated with narcotics and analgesics  we believe that an opportunity exists in all migraine therapeutic segments for products designed to deliver an improved onset and duration of relief with reduced side effects  especially those related to cardiovascular events 
products under development mt overview mt is being developed as an oral first line therapy for the treatment of migraine pain and associated symptoms 
oral products are currently the most prevalent form of migraine therapy 
according to ims  existing oral prescription products accounted for approximately billion in sales in the us in  of which the imitrex oral dosage form accounted for approximately million 
in  according to ims health  ims midas  the european prescription migraine market exceeded million  of which the triptans accounted for 
the uk and france  each with sales of approximately million  led the market 
in october  we submitted an maa for mt to the mca in the uk 
if approved in the uk  we will seek approval in selected european countries through the european union mutual recognition procedure mrp 
this procedure allows other european countries to grant national approvals based upon the review and endorsement of the mca in the uk 
we plan to submit an nda to the fda for mt in mid  and complete the nda submission by submitting final carcinogencity data in early mt is a proprietary formulation that combines metoclopramide hydrochloride  a commercially available agent that relieves nausea and enhances stomach emptying  and naproxen sodium  a commercially available anti inflammatory and analgesic agent 
mt is designed to release metoclopramide hydrochloride initially  followed by naproxen sodium 
the metoclopramide is intended to accelerate the absorption of naproxen and to reduce nausea  which can be associated with migraines 
results from our pharmacokinetic study in normal volunteers  completed in  indicated that peak naproxen blood levels were approximately higher and were achieved approximately minutes faster following administration of mt than with naproxen sodium alone 
clinical development prior to submission of an maa and an nda  we are required to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of our product candidates 
to demonstrate efficacy of a combination product candidate such as mt  which combines two previously approved component products  we must demonstrate in clinical trials that it is both superior to each of its individual components  and more effective in treating all symptoms of migraine when compared to a placebo 
for mt  this means that we must show statistically more patients have achieved sustained pain response  defined as migraine pain relief at two hours that is maintained throughout the next hours sustained pain relief  than patients treated with the component products 
we must also show that mt is superior to placebo for relief of nausea  sensitivity to light and sensitivity to sound 
generally  the fda requires two successful clinical trials to demonstrate that the product candidate meets each of these standards for approval 

table of contents to this end and to demonstrate mt s effectiveness as compared to other migraine therapies  we have completed a total of two phase clinical trials  six phase clinical trials  and two marketing support phase b studies  involving in total more than  treated patients  more than  of whom have received some form of mt the phase and phase b clinical trials have consistently demonstrated mt s effectiveness in treating migraine pain 
significantly  in two phase trials in which mt was compared to imitrex and placebo  mt demonstrated comparable efficacy to imitrex  and a lower percentage of patients taking a single tablet dose of mt reported adverse events than patients taking imitrex 
adverse events included drowsiness  diarrhea  abdominal pain  dizziness  infection and nervousness 
our mt phase and b trials are described below we conducted two phase clinical trials comparing a single tablet dose of mt with a mg dose of imitrex  the most widely prescribed dose 
in both studies  the sustained pain relief rates were nearly identical for mt and imitrex and both were statistically superior to placebo 
a  patient study completed in showed that both mt and imitrex were statistically superior to placebo for the relief of nausea  sensitivity to light and sensitivity to sound within hours of dosing 
in the initial comparison  a patient study completed in  mt was also superior to placebo in the relief of nausea  sensitivity to light and sensitivity to sound 
the incidence of adverse events was lower for patients taking a single tablet dose of mt than patients taking imitrex 
these results further confirmed the effectiveness of mt in treating migraine pain  however  it is unlikely the results will affect final product labeling 
we conducted two phase pivotal clinical trials  a  patient trial completed in and a  patient trial completed in  comparing mt to its components 
in both trials the sustained pain response for patients receiving mt was statistically significantly greater than the rate for patients receiving either naproxen sodium or metoclopramide hydrochloride alone 
using the statistical analysis methodology  logistic regression  specified in the first trial s protocol  mt showed statistically significant superiority over only one of its two components 
however  mt showed statistically significant superiority over both components when the results of this trial were analyzed using ordered logistic regression  a refinement of the statistical analysis methodology originally specified in the protocol 
the results from the second trial  which was designed based on discussions with the fda  were analyzed using ordered logistic regression and confirmed the results of the first trial 
we therefore believe that we have satisfied the fda requirement for the successful completion of two phase clinical trials showing mt to be superior to its components 
a phase multiple dosing trial including patients was completed in mid in which mt showed statistically significant superiority over placebo for sustained pain relief and  within two hours after initial dosing  for relief of nausea  sensitivity to light and sensitivity to sound 
a phase long term safety trial including more than  patients was completed in february in which mt was shown to be well tolerated 
only of the patients discontinued the study because of an adverse event including fatigue  drowsiness  restlessness  anxiety and diarrhea 
no patients discontinued the study because of chest pain or discomfort 
a phase b clinical trial including patients was completed in comparing mt to placebo in patients with an intolerance to a triptan or with cardiovascular risk factors that would warrant cautious use of a triptan  in which mt demonstrated statistically significant superiority to placebo for sustained pain relief 
a phase b clinical trial including patients was completed in comparing a two tablet dose of mt to placebo in patients who had not responded adequately to oral imitrex 
in this trial  mt demonstrated statistically significant superiority to placebo for sustained pain relief 
in addition to the required clinical trials  we completed a six month oral carcinogenicity study in p transgenic mice in the results from the six month study indicated that mt was not carcinogenic in the p transgenic mice 
we commenced a two year rat carcinogenicity study  in august and will complete the in life portion of that study in august we anticipate that the results of the study will be available in early the fda has agreed to accept results from the two year rat carcinogenicity study during the nda review period for mt we plan to submit the nda for mt to the fda in mid  and complete the nda submission by submitting final carcinogenicity data in early 
table of contents mt overview mt  a proprietary formulation of injectable dhe in a pre filled syringe  is being developed to provide long lasting pain relief for patients needing a convenient injectable therapy for severe migraine attacks  with a reduced side effect profile compared to existing injectable products 
currently  patients unable to take oral medications due to severe nausea may choose to use an injectable form of a triptan or another drug such as dhe 
however  many patients are unable to tolerate the injections  especially those sensitive to the vascular side effects associated with injectable imitrex 
nevertheless  according to ims  injectable migraine therapeutics represented approximately million in us sales 
published clinical trial results indicate that injectable dhe provides comparable efficacy to injectable imitrex three hours after administration 
in addition  in published clinical trials  only of injectable dhe patients experienced headache recurrence within hours as compared to of injectable imitrex patients 
acute vascular side effects were reported by only of the patients receiving injectable dhe compared to of the patients receiving injectable imitrex 
clinical development in december  we submitted an nda to the fda for mt the nda was accepted for filing by the fda in february and is under review 
we completed the following two mt phase trials in a phase clinical trial including patients in which mt provided sustained pain relief and pain relief at two hours in statistically significantly more patients than placebo 
regarding secondary endpoints  mt provided statistically significant relief of sensitivity to light by two hours following dosage  but did not provide relief of sensitivity to sound or nausea over the two hour post dose period 
however  a statistically significantly greater number of patients treated with mt than placebo who were free of nausea  sensitivity to light and sensitivity to sound at two hours  had no recurrence at hours 
a phase clinical trial including patients  which showed that a statistically significantly greater percentage of mt treated patients had sustained pain relief and pain relief at two hours post dosing than patients treated with placebo 
there were no statistically significant differences between mt and placebo in relief of the secondary symptoms of migraine nausea and sensitivity to light and sensitivity to sound over the two hour post dose period  as specified in the study protocol 
further analysis of the data indicated that a statistically significantly greater number of patients treated with mt than placebo had sustained relief of sensitivity to light and sensitivity to sound and the difference between mt and placebo in the sustained relief of nausea was marginally significant 
the fda will consider  as part of its review of the nda  the evaluation of the secondary endpoints using sustained relief 
mt overview mt is being developed as a co active migraine therapy  combining the activity of a triptan drug with that of an nsaid 
we believe that the effective treatment of migraine requires targeted  specific and complementary co active therapy to achieve maximum therapeutic benefit with the fewest side effects 
we expect to complete a development program for us and european regulatory approval for mt using a commercially approved triptan and commercially approved nsaid 
we will need to obtain the right to use the triptan that we specify in our nda for mt if we intend to commercialize mt prior to the expiration of the patent for that triptan 
patents for triptans begin to expire in in europe and in the us clinical development in  the fda approved our request to submit the mt nda as a b application  under which the fda allows a reduced development program 
in the uk  the mca agreed to a similar development program 
this reduced development plan will allow mt to proceed to phase clinical trials 
once we have identified the most suitable triptan for mt  we will initiate phase clinical trials 

table of contents in  we completed a patient  phase double blind  placebo controlled  single dose clinical trial in which mt showed statistically significant superiority over placebo and its components on the identified primary outcome measure of sustained pain relief 
in addition  mt showed statistically significant superiority over placebo and its components  including an oral triptan  in the two hour pain response and effectiveness in the relief of migraine associated symptoms 
with respect to the primary endpoint  sustained pain relief  the therapeutic gain with mt was more than twice the therapeutic gain seen with the triptan 
therapeutic gain is equal to the percent of patients with response on active agent minus the percent of patients with response on placebo control agent 
sales and marketing we currently have no sales or distribution capabilities 
we plan to enter into collaborations with established pharmaceutical or pharmaceutical services companies to commercialize and manufacture our product candidates 
alternatively  we may elect to develop sales and distribution capabilities internally in order to commercialize one or more of our product candidates 
in certain instances  we may also promote our products in collaboration with other pharmaceutical companies 
manufacturing we currently have no manufacturing capability and we do not intend to establish internal manufacturing capabilities 
to date  we have entered into arrangements with third party manufacturers for the supply of formulated and packaged mt  mt and mt clinical trial materials 
use of third party manufacturing enables us to focus on our clinical development strengths  minimize fixed costs and capital expenditures and gain access to advanced manufacturing process capabilities and expertise 
we also intend to enter into agreements with third party manufacturers for the commercial scale manufacturing of our products 
in january  we entered into a commercial supply agreement with dsm pharmaceuticals  inc under which dsm will supply us with all mt for commercial sale 
we  or our commercial partner  are required to purchase all commercial supply of mt from dsm for the initial term of the agreement and any extension thereof  unless dsm is unable to meet our  or our commercial partner s  requirements 
we have the right to terminate the agreement under certain circumstances after the third anniversary of the first commercial sale of mt following nda approval 
in october  we entered into a commercial supply agreement with lek pharmaceuticals inc  a subsidiary of novartis pharma ag  under which lek agreed to provide us with dhe  which we will formulate as mt we agreed to purchase dhe exclusively from lek  which exclusivity is dependent upon lek s ability to meet our supply requirements and certain other conditions 
lek will supply to us solely and exclusively  under certain circumstances 
we will pay lek  under certain circumstances  a fee in addition to the agreed supply price for dhe  based on a percentage of mt sales revenue 
either party may cancel the agreement under certain conditions 
in addition  lek may terminate the agreement after a certain period of time  under agreed transition  supply and know how transfer provisions  if lek decides to permanently cease the manufacture of dhe 
we have agreements with various vendors to supply us with clinical supply materials for our mt  mt  and mt clinical trials 
we believe our current supplier agreements should be sufficient to complete both our ongoing and planned clinical trials 
competition not all migraine attacks are of the same severity 
consequently  a variety of oral  injectable and intranasal therapies are used to treat different types of migraine attacks 
attacks are often treated initially with simple over the counter analgesics  particularly if the patient is unable to determine if the attack is a migraine or some other type of headache 
these analgesics include excedrin migraine  which is approved for the pain associated with migraine 
if over the counter remedies are unsuccessful  patients often turn to more potent prescription drugs  including triptans 
according to ims  in  total triptan sales in the us were approximately billion 
imitrex  a triptan product marketed by glaxosmithkline  had total us sales of approximately billion in  according to ims 
narcotics such as codeine and drugs containing analgesic narcotic combinations  along with other non narcotic pain medications  are also used for the treatment of migraine 
if approved  our migraine product candidates will most likely compete with one or more of the existing migraine therapeutics  as well as any therapies developed in the future 

table of contents the pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological progress 
certain pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies and academic and research organizations currently engage in  or have engaged in  efforts related to the discovery and development of new medicines for the treatment of migraine symptoms 
significant levels of research in chemistry and biotechnology occur in universities and other nonprofit research institutions 
these entities have become increasingly active in seeking patent protection and licensing revenues for their research results 
they also compete with us in recruiting skilled scientific talent 
our ability to compete successfully will be based on our ability to create and maintain scientifically advanced technology  develop proprietary products  attract and retain scientific personnel  obtain patent or other protection for our products  obtain required regulatory approvals and manufacture and successfully market our products either alone or through outside parties 
some of our competitors have substantially greater financial  research and development  manufacturing  marketing and human resources and greater experience in product discovery  development  clinical trial management  fda regulatory review  manufacturing and marketing than we do 
patents and proprietary information we intend to actively seek  when appropriate  protection for our products and proprietary technology by means of us and foreign patents  trademarks and contractual arrangements 
in addition  we plan to rely upon trade secrets and contractual agreements to protect certain of our proprietary technology and products 
we have five issued us patents and four pending and one allowed us patent applications  and we presently have pending foreign patent applications or issued foreign patents  relating to mt  mt and mt foreign patent applications have been filed under the patent cooperation treaty  or pct  and are in various stages of prosecution worldwide relating to mt  mt and mt we also have us and pct patent applications pending relating to a novel product concept 
there can be no assurance that our patent applications will issue as patents or  with respect to our issued patents  that they will provide us with significant protection 
the following provides a general description of our patent portfolio and is not intended to represent an assessment of claim limitations or claim scope 
mt we have two issued us patents  one with claims relating to dosage forms that can be used in administering metoclopramide and a long acting nsaid to a patient with migraine headache and one with claims relating to various pharmaceutical compositions and treatment methods that can be used with migraine patients 
within these issued us patents are also claims relating to a method of manufacturing a specific type of dosage form 
we have one issued australian patent 
we have one pending us patent application with claims relating to various pharmaceutical compositions and treatment methods that can be used for migraine patients 
in addition  there are applications relating to mt that are pending in canada  europe and japan 
the expected expiration date of the issued us and australian patents relating to mt is november  additional us and foreign patents  if issued  are expected to expire in a similar timeframe 
mt with respect to mt  we received a us patent relating to therapeutic packages containing a high potency formulation of dhe in a pre filled syringe 
we also have a pending us patent application with claims relating to additional high potency formulations and therapeutic packages  and we have patent applications pending in major markets worldwide 
mt we have two issued us patents with claims relating to methods  compositions and therapeutic packages involving the use of certain nsaids and ht receptor agonists in treating patients with migraine 
outside of the us  we have an issued patent in australia and pending patent applications relating to mt pending in canada  europe and japan 
on january   we received a notice of allowance from the us patent and trademark office for a patent application with claims directed to the use of triptans and nsaids in treating patients with migraine 
the expected expiration date of the issued us patents relating to mt is august  foreign patents  if issued  are expected to expire in a similar timeframe 
we have also filed a provisional us patent application with claims directed to formulations of mt 
table of contents other products we have filed us and foreign patent applications with claims directed to novel formulations for a new product concept which is currently in the exploratory stage 
should any patents issue from these applications they would be expected to expire on may  other intellectual property much of the know how of importance to us is dependent upon the knowledge  experience and skills of key scientific and technical personnel 
to protect our rights to proprietary know how and technology  we require employees  consultants and advisors to enter into confidentiality agreements that prohibit the disclosure of confidential information to anyone outside of the company 
there can be no assurance that these agreements will effectively prevent disclosure of our confidential information 
in the absence of effective patent or other protection of intellectual property  our business may be adversely affected by competitors who develop substantially equivalent or superior technology or know how 
the patent and other intellectual property positions of pharmaceutical companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
we cannot assure you that our patent rights will provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages over our competitors  our patent rights will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  others will not independently develop technologies similar to ours or duplicate our technologies  or the patents issued to or licensed by us will not be infringed or challenged 
government regulation the fda and comparable regulatory agencies in foreign countries impose substantial requirements on the clinical development  manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical product candidates 
these agencies and other federal  state and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing  manufacture  quality control  safety  effectiveness  labeling  storage  record keeping  approval and promotion of our product candidates 
all of our product candidates will require regulatory approval before commercialization 
in particular  therapeutic product candidates for human use are subject to rigorous preclinical and clinical testing and other requirements of the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act ffdca  implemented by the fda  as well as similar statutory and regulatory requirements of foreign countries 
obtaining these marketing approvals and subsequently complying with ongoing statutory and regulatory requirements is costly and time consuming 
any failure by us or our collaborators  licensors or licensees to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals or in complying with other requirements could adversely affect the commercialization of product candidates then being developed by us and our ability to receive product or royalty revenues 
the steps required before a new drug product candidate may be distributed commercially in the us generally include conducting appropriate preclinical laboratory evaluations of the product candidate s chemistry  formulation and stability and preclinical studies in animals to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product candidate  submitting the results of these evaluations and tests to the fda  along with manufacturing information and analytical data  in an investigational new drug application  or ind  initiating clinical trials under the ind after the resolution of any safety or regulatory concerns of the fda  obtaining approval of institutional review boards  or irbs  to introduce the drug into humans in clinical studies  conducting adequate and well controlled human clinical trials that establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for the intended use  typically in the following three sequential  or slightly overlapping stages 
table of contents phase the product is initially introduced into human subjects or patients and tested for safety  dose tolerance  absorption  metabolism  distribution and excretion  phase the product candidate is studied in patients to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks  to determine dosage tolerance and the optimal dosage  and to collect some efficacy data  phase the product candidate is studied in an expanded patient population at multiple clinical study sites  to confirm efficacy and safety at the optimized dose  by measuring primary and secondary endpoints established at the outset of the study  submitting the results of preclinical studies  and clinical trials as well as chemistry  manufacturing and control information on the product candidate to the fda in a new drug application form  or nda  and obtaining fda approval of the nda prior to any commercial sale or shipment of the product candidate 
this process can take a number of years and require substantial financial resources 
the results of preclinical studies and initial clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of the results from large scale clinical trials  and clinical trials may be subject to additional costs  delays or modifications due to a number of factors  including the difficulty in obtaining enough patients  clinical investigators  product candidate supply or financial support 
the fda may also require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved product candidates that have been commercialized  and the agency has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product candidate based on the results of these post marketing programs 
upon approval  a product candidate may be marketed only in those dosage forms and for those indications approved in the nda 
in addition to obtaining fda approval for each indication to be treated with each product candidate  each domestic product candidate manufacturing establishment must register with the fda  list its product with the fda  comply with the applicable fda current good manufacturing practices  or cgmp  regulations  which include requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance  as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation  and permit and pass manufacturing plant inspections by the fda 
moreover  the submission of applications for approval may require additional time to complete manufacturing stability studies 
foreign establishments manufacturing product for distribution in the us also must list their product candidates with the fda and comply with cgmp regulations 
they are also subject to periodic inspection by the fda or by local authorities under agreement with the fda 
any product candidates manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to fda approvals are subject to extensive continuing regulation by the fda  including record keeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences with the product candidate 
in addition to continued compliance with standard regulatory requirements  the fda may also require post marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the marketed product 
adverse experiences with the product candidate must be reported to the fda 
product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems concerning safety or efficacy of the product are discovered following approval 
the ffdca also mandates that products be manufactured consistent with cgmp regulations 
in complying with the cgmp regulations  manufacturers must continue to spend time  money and effort in production  record keeping  quality control  and auditing to ensure that the marketed product meets applicable specifications and other requirements 
the fda periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to ensure compliance with cgmp regulations 
failure to comply subjects the manufacturer to possible fda action  such as warning letters  suspension of manufacturing  seizure of the product  voluntary recall of a product or injunctive action  as well as possible civil penalties 
we currently rely on  and intend to continue to rely on  third parties to manufacture our compounds and product candidates 
these third parties will be required to comply with cgmp regulations 
even after the fda approval has been obtained  further studies  including post marketing studies  may be required 
results of post marketing studies may limit or expand the further marketing of the products 
if we propose any modifications to a product  including changes in indication  manufacturing process  manufacturing facility or labeling  a supplement to our nda may be required to be submitted to the fda 
products manufactured in the us for distribution abroad will be subject to fda regulations regarding export  as well as to the requirements of the country to which they are shipped 
these latter requirements are likely to cover the conduct of clinical trials  the submission of marketing applications  and all aspects of manufacturing and marketing 
such requirements can vary significantly from country to country 

table of contents we are also subject to various federal  state and local laws  rules  regulations and policies relating to safe working conditions  laboratory and manufacturing practices  the experimental use of animals and the use of and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances used in connection with our research work 
although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with current federal  state and local laws  rules  regulations and policies  the risk of accidental injury or contamination from these materials cannot be entirely eliminated 
before a medicinal product can be supplied in the european union eu  it must first be granted a marketing authorization 
there are two routes by which this may be achieved the centralized procedure whereby an approval granted by the european commission permits the supply of the product in question throughout the eu or the national route where national authorizations are granted by the competent authorities of individual eu countries for the supply of products in that country only 
the centralized route is compulsory for biotechnology products and is optional for certain so called high technology products 
all products which are not authorized by the centralized route must be authorized by an eu member country and where it is intended that the product be marketed in more than one country  authorization must be by way of the mrp 
under the mrp  the competent authorities of designated eu countries are requested to mutually recognise a marketing authorization already granted by another eu country 
an maa in respect of mt was submitted to the mca in the uk in october in the uk  the regulation of medicinal products is governed by the medicines act of and subsequent delegated legislation 
essentially all applications must include full details of the product and the research that has been carried out to establish its efficacy  safety and quality 
the mca will seek to ensure that the product satisfies the appropriate requirements for efficacy  safety and quality by an assessment carried out by an advisory committee  which may  if it wishes  advise the mca to refuse an application 
mt is a fixed combination medicinal product incorporating two previously approved active ingredients 
such products will only be considered acceptable by the mca if the proposed combination is based on valid therapeutic principles 
the possibility of interactions between the substances will be assessed and it will be necessary to establish that either interactions do not occur or if they do occur  they are clearly established and defined 
furthermore  special safety and efficacy requirements apply to fixed combination products in that the dosage of each active ingredient within the combination product must be such that the combination is safe and effective for a significant population subgroup and the benefit risk assessment of the fixed combination must equal or exceed the corresponding profile of each of the active ingredients taken alone 
if the mca grants the authorization for the product to be marketed in the uk  further applications will typically be made to the competent authorities of other eu countries by way of the mrp 
the competent authorities of the designated eu countries will be requested to recognize the authorization of the mca based upon an assessment report prepared by the mca 
the process should take no longer than days  but if one country makes an objection which under the legislation can only be based on a possible risk to human health  but in practice some countries have used the days to cover issues beyond the scope of the legislation  we have the option to withdraw the application from that country or take the application to arbitration by the committee for propriety medicinal products cpmp of the emea 
if a referral is made  the procedure is suspended and in the intervening time the only eu country in which the product can be marketed will be the uk  even if all other designated countries are ready to recognize the product 
the opinion of the cpmp  which is binding  could support or reflect the objections or alternatively reach a compromise position acceptable to all eu countries concerned 
arbitration can be avoided if the application is withdrawn in the objecting country  but once the application has been referred to arbitration it cannot be withdrawn 
the arbitration procedure may take an additional year before a final decision is reached and may require the delivery of additional data 
once granted  any marketing authorization ma remains subject to pharmacovigilance and all competent authorities have the power to vary  suspend or revoke an ma on grounds of safety 
the extent of us and foreign government regulation which might result from future legislation or administrative action cannot be accurately predicted 
for example  in the us  although the food and drug administration modernization act of modified and created requirements and standards under the ffdca with the intent of facilitating product development and marketing  the fda is still in the process of developing regulations implementing the food and drug administration modernization act of consequently  the actual effect of these and other developments on our own business is uncertain and unpredictable

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a pharmaceutical development company committed to building a portfolio of product candidates with significant commercial potential 
the company s initial focus is the multi billion dollar global migraine market 
mt  our proprietary formulation containing metoclopramide hydrochloride and naproxen sodium  is being developed as an oral  first line treatment for migraine pain and associated symptoms 
the company completed all planned phase pivotal clinical trials for mt  which consistently demonstrated mt s effectiveness in treating migraine pain 
in october  pozen submitted an maa to the mca in the uk for mt if approved in the uk  pozen will seek approval in selected european countries through the european union mutual recognition procedure 
the company plans to submit an nda to the fda for mt in mid  and complete the nda submission by submitting final carcinogenicity data in early mt  a proprietary formulation of dhe in a pre filled syringe  is being developed to provide long lasting pain relief for patients needing a convenient injectable therapy for severe migraine attacks 
pozen has completed all planned phase pivotal clinical trials for mt  which consistently demonstrated mt s effectiveness in treating migraine pain 
in december  the company submitted an nda to the fda for mt mt is being developed as a co active acute migraine therapy  combining the activity of a triptan with that of a long lasting nsaid 
the company has completed a patient phase clinical trial in which mt showed statistically significant superiority over placebo and its components  including an oral triptan  on the identified primary and secondary outcome measures 
specifically  our business activities since inception have included product candidate research and development  designing and funding clinical trials for our product candidates  regulatory and clinical affairs  intellectual property prosecution and expansion  and business development  including product acquisition and or licensing activities 
historically  we have financed our operations and internal growth primarily through private placements of preferred stock and our initial public offering rather than through collaborative or partnership agreements 
therefore  we have no research funding or collaboration payments payable to us nor have we received any payments that are refundable or subject to performance milestones 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception and have not generated any revenue 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was  our historical operating losses have resulted principally from our research and development activities  including phase clinical trial activities for our product candidates mt and mt  phase clinical trial activities for our product candidate mt  and general and administrative expenses 
we expect to continue to incur operating losses over the next several years as we complete our development of mt  mt and mt and apply for regulatory approval  develop any other product candidates  and acquire and develop product portfolios in other therapeutic areas 
our results may vary depending on many factors  including the progress of mt  mt and mt in the clinical and regulatory process  the establishment of collaborations for the development and commercialization of any of our migraine product candidates  and the acquisition and or in licensing  and development  of other therapeutic product candidates 
our ability to generate revenue is dependent upon our ability  alone or with others  to successfully develop our migraine and other product candidates  obtain regulatory approvals and  alone or with others  successfully manufacture and market our future products 

table of contents in october  we received  in net proceeds from the sale of  shares of our common stock in our initial public offering  including the exercise of the underwriters over allotment option 
all of our outstanding preferred shares were converted into shares of our common stock upon the completion of our initial public offering 
in connection with the grant of stock options to employees  we recorded deferred compensation of approximately  in the three years ended december  the deferred compensation amounts were recorded as a component of stockholders equity and are being amortized as charges to operations over the vesting period of the options using the straight line method 
the vesting period of these options is generally three years 
approximately   and  of deferred compensation expense were charged to operations in the years ended december   and  respectively 
as of december   we anticipate charging to operations additional amounts of amortization of deferred compensation of approximately  for the year ended december  critical accounting policies the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies can have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an on going basis and base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may vary from what we anticipate and different assumptions or estimates about the future could change our reported results 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our financial statements  we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to us  in that they are important to the portrayal of our financial statements and require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of our financial statements 
accrued liabilities  specifically contracted costs the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
specifically  our management must make estimates of costs incurred to date but not yet invoiced in relation to contracted  external costs 
management analyzes the progress of product development  clinical trial and toxicology activities  invoices received and budgeted costs when evaluating the adequacy of the accrued liability for these related costs 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the accrued liability in the accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of the accrued liability for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
income taxes we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the net tax effects of tax credits  operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
through december   we believe that all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized and  accordingly  we have recorded a valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets 
if results of operations in the future indicate that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be recovered  the reduction of the valuation allowance will be recorded as a tax benefit during one or more periods 

table of contents historical results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue we generated no revenue during the years ended december  and research and development research and development expenses increased to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in expense was due to increased costs associated with the development of mt and mt  offset by a decrease in development costs for mt and termination of all development activities for mt mt costs increased by  primarily due to increased phase clinical trial activities in the second and third quarters of as compared to the same period of and costs associated with submission of an nda to the fda in december mt costs increased by  primarily due to increased costs associated with obtaining drug substance  and increased toxicology activities  as compared to costs associated with the development of mt decreased by  due to a decrease in phase clinical trial activities during  as compared to mt costs decreased by  the costs associated with all other product candidates increased by  other research and development costs increased by  total amortization of deferred stock compensation included in research and development expenses was  for as compared to  for we expect that research and development expenditures will decrease in as a result of completion of most planned clinical trials for mt and mt in we have included in our research and development expenses the personnel costs related to our research activities and costs related to product development  clinical trial and toxicology activities  and regulatory matters 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the  increase was due to increased services and other costs related to marketing  advertising and intellectual property consulting expenses associated with our business development activities that totaled  along with a  increase in other general operating expenses 
total amortization of deferred compensation included in general and administrative expenses was  for as compared to  for we expect that general and administrative expenditures will continue to increase due to increasing fees and expenses associated with the growth in our market research  business development and commercialization efforts 
general and administrative expenses consisted primarily of the costs of administrative personnel  facility infrastructure  business development and public company activities 
interest income  net net interest income decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  interest income declined primarily due to a decline in interest rates along with a decrease in levels of cash and cash equivalents available for investing during the year 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue we generated no revenue during the year ended december  or research and development research and development expenses decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this net decrease of  was due primarily to a net decrease in direct product development costs of the costs related to the research and development of mt decreased by  in  due primarily to decreased clinical trial activities 
during the year  while conducting three phase clinical trials  expenditures related to mt were at their highest historical level 
during  the research and development costs related to mt and mt increased by  and  respectively  as a result of increased clinical trial activities compared to the prior year 
the costs associated with all other product candidates increased by  other research and development costs increased by  including an increase of  in personnel costs 
total amortization of deferred stock compensation included in research and development expenses was  for as compared to  for we have included in our research and development expenses the personnel costs related to our research activities and costs related to clinical trial preparations  monitoring expenses  and regulatory matters 

table of contents general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  this increase of  includes an increase of  in personnel and related benefits  an increase of  in fees  services and other costs related to public disclosure and investor communication activities  along with increases in other general operating expenses that totaled  total amortization of deferred compensation included in general and administrative expenses was  for as compared to  for we have included in our general and administrative expenses the costs of administrative personnel and related facility costs along with legal  accounting and professional fees  services and other costs related to public disclosure and investor communication activities 
interest income  net net interest income increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  interest income increased due to increased levels of cash and cash equivalents available for investing resulting from our initial public offering in october income taxes as of december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and research and development credit carryforwards of approximately million 
these federal and state net operating loss carryforwards and research and development credit carryforwards begin to expire in the utilization of the loss carryforwards to reduce future income taxes will depend on our ability to generate sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of the net loss carryforwards 
in addition  the maximum annual use of net loss carryforwards is limited in certain situations where changes occur in our stock ownership 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations and internal growth primarily through private placements of preferred stock and our initial public offering  resulting in aggregate net proceeds to us of  at december   cash and cash equivalents totaled  a decrease of  as compared to december  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents resulted primarily from our operating activities 
cash used by operations of  during the year ended december  represented a net loss of  offset by non cash charges of  an increase in prepaid and other assets of  and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of  cash used in investing activities of  during the year ended december  reflected the purchase of furniture  equipment and leasehold improvements 
cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december  totaled  reflecting the net proceeds from the exercise of common stock options and warrants 
we believe that our existing liquidity and capital resources  including the proceeds from our initial public offering  will be sufficient to complete our on going and planned clinical trials reflected in the description of our business  to conduct appropriate development studies  and to satisfy our other currently anticipated cash needs for operating expenses for the next two years 
below is a summary of our contractual obligations for our operational leases 
year amount total 
table of contents we do not expect to make any material capital expenditures during the next two years 
in addition  we do not currently have any milestone or other required material payment obligations during that period 
however  we cannot be certain that additional funding will not be required and  if required  will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
further  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the number and progress of our clinical trials and other trials and studies  our ability to negotiate favorable terms with various contractors assisting in these trials and studies  our success in commercializing the products to which we have rights  and costs incurred to enforce and defend our patent claims and other intellectual rights 
recent accounting pronouncements in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring issue

 elements of financial statements 
the standard is effective for us beginning january  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  sfas 
sfas amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas  to provide alternative methods of transition to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure provisions of sfas to require disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies of the effects of an entity s accounting policy with respect to stock based employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements 
sfas does not amend sfas to require companies to account for their employee stock based awards using the fair value method 
however  the disclosure provisions are required for all companies with stock based employee compensation  regardless of whether they utilize the fair method of accounting described in sfas or the intrinsic value method described in apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas s amendment of the transition and annual disclosure provisions of sfas are effective for fiscal years ending after december   with earlier application permitted for entities with fiscal years ending prior to december   provided that financial statements for the fiscal year were not issued prior to the issuance of statement december  
the disclosure requirements for interim financial statements containing condensed consolidated financial statements are effective for interim periods beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have an impact on our results of operations or financial position 
factors that may affect our results our business is subject to certain risks and uncertainties  each of which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
additional risks that are not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business 
we depend heavily on the success of our product candidates  which may never be approved for commercial use 
if we are unable to develop  gain approval of or commercialize those product candidates  we may never be profitable 

table of contents we anticipate that for the foreseeable future our ability to achieve profitability will be dependent on the successful development  approval and commercialization of our current product candidates  particularly mt and mt many factors could negatively affect the success of our efforts to develop and commercialize our product candidates  including negative  inconclusive or otherwise unfavorable results from any studies or clinical trials  an inability to obtain  or delay in obtaining  regulatory approval for the commercialization of our product candidates  an inability to establish collaborative arrangements with third parties for the manufacture and commercialization of our product candidates  or any disruption of any of these arrangements  if established  a failure to achieve market acceptance of our product candidates  significant delays in any required studies or clinical studies  any demand by the fda that we conduct additional clinical trials or other studies and the expenses relating thereto  and significant increases in the costs of any studies or clinical trials 
we have incurred losses since inception and anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future 
we do not have a current source of product revenue and may never be profitable 
we have incurred losses in each year since our inception and we currently have no source of product revenue 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect to incur significant and increasing operating losses and do not know when or if we will generate product revenue 
we expect that the amount of our operating losses will fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of increases and decreases in development efforts  the timing of payments that we may receive from others  and other factors 
our ability to achieve profitability is dependent on a number of factors  including our ability to develop and obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates  successfully commercialize our product candidates  which may include entering into collaborative agreements  and secure contract manufacturing and distribution services 
if we  or our collaborators  do not obtain and maintain required regulatory approvals  we will be unable to commercialize our product candidates 
our product candidates under development are subject to extensive domestic and foreign regulation 
the fda regulates  among other things  the development  testing  manufacture  safety  efficacy  record keeping  labeling  storage  approval  advertisement  promotion  sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products 
if we market our products abroad  they are also subject to extensive regulation by foreign governments 
none of our product candidates have been approved for sale in the united states or any foreign market 
a separate nda must be filed with respect to each indication for which marketing approval of a product is sought 
each nda  in turn  requires the successful completion of preclinical  toxicology  genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies  as well as clinical trials demonstrating the safety and efficacy of the product for that particular indication 
we may not receive regulatory approval of any of the ndas that we file with the fda 
if we are unable to obtain and maintain fda and foreign governmental approvals for our product candidates  we will not be permitted to sell them 
approval of a product candidate may be conditioned upon certain limitations and restrictions as to the drug s use  or upon the conduct of further studies  and is subject to continuous review 
the fda may also require us to conduct additional post approval studies 
these post approval studies may include carcinogenicity studies in animals or further human clinical trials 
the later discovery of previously unknown problems with the product  manufacturer or manufacturing facility may result in criminal prosecution  civil penalties  recall or seizure of products  or total or partial suspension of production  as well as other regulatory action against our product candidates or us 
if approvals are withdrawn for a product  or if a product is seized or recalled  we would be unable to sell that product and our revenues would suffer 
we and our contract manufacturers are required to comply with the applicable fda current good manufacturing practices cgmp regulations  which include requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance  as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation 

table of contents further  manufacturing facilities must be approved by the fda before they can be used to manufacture our product candidates  and are subject to additional fda inspection 
we  or our third party manufacturers  may not be able to comply with cgmp regulations or other fda regulatory requirements  resulting in a delay or an inability to manufacture the products 
labeling and promotional activities are subject to scrutiny by the fda and state regulatory agencies and  in some circumstances  the federal trade commission 
fda enforcement policy prohibits the marketing of approved products for unapproved  or off label  uses 
these regulations and the fda s interpretation of them may impair our ability to effectively market products for which we gain approval 
failure to comply with these requirements can result in regulatory enforcement action by the fda 
further  we may not obtain the labeling claims we believe are necessary or desirable for the promotion of our product candidates 
similarly  the above considerations and risks apply to regulatory approvals in foreign markets including the application in respect to mt submitted to the mca in the uk 
we depend on collaborations with third parties for the development of our products  which may reduce our product revenues or restrict our ability to commercialize our products 
our ability to develop  manufacture  and obtain regulatory approval of our existing and any future product candidates depends upon our ability to enter into and maintain contractual and collaborative arrangements with others 
we have  and intend in the future to continue to have  contract manufacturers and clinical trial investigators 
in addition  the identification of new compounds or product candidates for development may require us to enter into licensing or other collaborative agreements with others  including pharmaceutical companies and research institutions 
these third party contractual or collaborative arrangements may require us to grant rights  including marketing rights  to one or more parties 
these arrangements may also contain covenants restricting our product development or business efforts in the future  or other terms that are burdensome to us  and may involve the acquisition of our equity securities 
collaborative agreements for the acquisition of new compounds or product candidates may require us to pay license fees  make milestone payments and or pay royalties 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to maintain our existing or future collaborative or contractual arrangements  or that we will be able to enter into future arrangements with third parties on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if we fail to maintain our existing arrangements or to establish new arrangements when and as necessary  we could be required to undertake these activities at our own expense  which would significantly increase our capital requirements and may delay the development of our product candidates 
we are subject to a number of risks associated with our dependence on contractual and collaborative arrangements with others we may not have day to day control over the activities of our contractors or collaborators 
third parties may not fulfill their obligations to us 
we may not realize the contemplated or expected benefits from collaborative or other arrangements 
business combinations and changes in the contractors or their business strategy may adversely affect their willingness or ability to complete their obligations to us 
the contractor or collaborator may have the right to terminate its arrangements with us on limited or no notice and for reasons outside of our control 
the contractor or collaborator may develop or have rights to competing products or product candidates and withdraw support or cease to perform work on our products 
disagreements may arise regarding breach of the arrangement  ownership of proprietary rights  clinical results or regulatory approvals 
these factors could lead to delays in the development of our product candidates  and disagreements with our contractors or collaborators could require or result in litigation or arbitration  which would be time consuming and expensive 
our ultimate success may depend upon the success and performance on the part of these third parties 
if we fail to maintain these relationships or establish new relationships as required  development of our product candidates will be delayed 

table of contents we will need to enter into agreements with third parties that possess sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  or establish internally the capability in order to perform these functions  in order to successfully market and sell our future drug products 
we have no sales or distribution personnel or capabilities 
if we are unable to enter into collaborations with established pharmaceutical or pharmaceutical services companies to provide those capabilities  or alternatively  we are unable to develop internally sales and distribution capabilities  we will not be able to successfully commercialize our products 
to the extent that we enter into marketing and sales agreements with third parties  our revenues  if any  will be affected by the sales and marketing efforts of those third parties 
further  we cannot guarantee that  should we elect to develop our own sales and distribution capabilities  we would have sufficient resources to do so  or would be able to hire the qualified sales and marketing personnel we would need 
we need to conduct preclinical  toxicology  genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies and clinical trials on our product candidates 
any unanticipated costs or delays in these studies or trials  or the need to conduct additional studies or trials or to seek to persuade the fda to evaluate the results of a study or trial in a different manner  could reduce or delay our revenues and profitability 
generally  we must demonstrate the efficacy and safety of our product candidates before approval to market can be obtained from the fda 
our product candidates are in various stages of clinical development 
depending upon the stage at which a product candidate is in the development process  we will need to complete preclinical  toxicology  genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies  as well as clinical trials  on these product candidates before we submit marketing applications in the united states and abroad 
these studies and trials can be very costly and time consuming 
in addition  we rely on third parties to perform significant aspects of our studies and clinical trials  introducing additional sources of risk into our development programs 
it should also be noted that results from preclinical testing and early clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of results obtained in later clinical trials involving large scale testing of patients in comparison to control groups 
the completion of clinical trials depends upon many factors  including the rate of enrollment of patients 
if we are unable to recruit sufficient clinical patients during the appropriate period  we may need to delay our clinical trials and incur significant additional costs 
we also rely on the compliance of our clinical trial investigators with fda regulatory requirements and noncompliance can result in disqualification of a clinical trial investigator and data that is unusable 
in addition  the fda or institutional review boards may require us to conduct additional trials or delay  restrict or discontinue our clinical trials on various grounds  including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk 
even though we have completed all planned phase pivotal clinical trials for mt and submitted an nda for mt  and even if we complete our current clinical trials for mt  we may be required to conduct additional clinical trials and studies to support our ndas to the fda 
we may determine to seek to persuade the fda to evaluate the results of a study or trial in a manner that differs from the way the fda usually evaluates results 
for example  approval of mt will require positive fda action on our request that secondary endpoints be evaluated based upon sustained response 
in addition  we may have unexpected results that require us to reconsider the need for certain studies or trials 
for example  results from a genotoxicity study involving mt may require us to conduct chronic toxicology and carcinogenicity studies 
once submitted  an nda would require fda approval before we could distribute or commercialize the product described in the application 
even if we determine that data from our clinical trials  toxicology  genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies are positive  we cannot assure you that the fda  after completing its analysis  will not determine that the trials or studies should have been conducted or analyzed differently  and thus reach a different conclusion from that reached by us  or request that further trials  studies or analyses be conducted 
for example  the fda may require data in certain subpopulations  such as pediatric use  or may require long term carcinogenicity studies  prior to nda approval  unless we can obtain a waiver to delay such studies 
our costs associated with our human clinical trials vary based on a number of factors  including the order and timing of clinical indications pursued  the extent of development and financial support from collaborative parties  if any  the need to conduct additional clinical trials or studies  the number of patients required for enrollment  the difficulty of obtaining sufficient patient populations and clinicians  the difficulty of obtaining clinical supplies of our product candidates  and governmental and regulatory delays 

table of contents even if we obtain positive preclinical or clinical study results initially  future clinical trial results may not be similarly positive 
we currently depend and will in the future depend on third parties to manufacture our product candidates 
if these manufacturers fail to meet our requirements or any regulatory requirements  the product development and commercialization of our product candidates will be delayed 
we do not have  and have no plans to develop  the internal capability to manufacture either clinical trial or commercial quantities of products that we may develop or are under development 
we rely upon third party manufacturers to supply us with our product candidates 
we also need supply contracts to sell our products commercially 
there is no guarantee that manufacturers that enter into commercial supply contracts with us will be financially viable entities going forward 
if we do not have the necessary commercial supply contracts  or if our current manufacturer is unable to satisfy our requirements or meet any regulatory requirements  and we are required to find an alternative source of supply  there may be additional costs and delays in product development and commercialization of our product candidates or we may be required to comply with additional regulatory requirements 
if our competitors develop and commercialize products faster than we do or if their products are superior to ours  our commercial opportunities will be reduced or eliminated 
our product candidates will have to compete with existing and any newly developed migraine therapies 
there are also likely to be numerous competitors developing new products to treat migraine and the other diseases and conditions for which we may seek to develop products in the future  which could render our product candidates or technologies obsolete or non competitive 
our primary competitors will likely include large pharmaceutical companies  biotechnology companies  universities and public and private research institutions 
we face  and will continue to face  intense competition from other companies for securing collaborations with pharmaceutical companies  establishing relationships with academic and research institutions  and acquiring licenses to proprietary technology 
these competitors  either alone or with collaborative parties  may succeed with technologies or products that are more effective than any of our current or future technologies or products 
many of our actual or potential competitors  either alone or together with collaborative parties  have substantially greater financial resources  and almost all of our competitors have larger numbers of scientific and administrative personnel than we do 
many of these competitors  either alone or together with their collaborative parties  also have significantly greater experience than we do in developing product candidates  undertaking preclinical testing and human clinical trials  obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals of product candidates  and manufacturing and marketing products 
accordingly  our actual or potential competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection  receiving fda approval or commercializing products before we do 
our competitors may also develop products or technologies that are superior to those that we are developing  and render our product candidates or technologies obsolete or non competitive 
if we cannot successfully compete with new or existing products  our marketing and sales will suffer and we may not ever be profitable 
if we are unable to protect our patents or proprietary rights  or if we are unable to operate our business without infringing the patents and proprietary rights of others  we may be unable to develop our product candidates or compete effectively 
the pharmaceutical industry places considerable importance on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for new technologies  products and processes 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability  and the ability of our licensors  to obtain and to keep protection for our products and technologies under the patent laws of the united states and other countries  so that we can stop others from using our inventions 
our success also will depend on our ability to prevent others from using our trade secrets 
in addition  we must operate in a way that does not infringe  or violate  the patent  trade secret and other intellectual property rights of other parties 

table of contents we cannot know how much protection  if any  our patents will provide or whether our patent applications will issue as patents 
the breadth of claims that will be allowed in patent applications cannot be predicted and neither the validity nor enforceability of claims in issued patents can be assured 
if  for any reason  we are unable to obtain and enforce valid claims covering our products and technology  we may be unable to prevent competitors from using the same or similar technology or to prevent competitors from marketing identical products 
in addition  due to the extensive time needed to develop and test our products  any patents that we obtain may expire in a short time after commercialization 
this would reduce or eliminate any advantages that such patents may give us 
we may need to license rights to third party patents and intellectual property to continue the development and marketing of our product candidates 
if we are unable to acquire such rights on acceptable terms  our development activities may be blocked and we may be unable to bring our product candidates to market 
we may enter into litigation to defend ourselves against claims of infringement  assert claims that a third party is infringing one or more of our patents  protect our trade secrets or know how  or determine the scope and validity of others patent or proprietary rights 
as a result of such litigation  our patent claims may be found to be invalid  unenforceable or not of sufficient scope to cover the activities of an alleged infringer 
if we are found to infringe the patent rights of others  then we may be forced to pay damages sufficient to irreparably harm the company and or be prevented from continuing our product development and marketing activities 
regardless of its eventual outcome  any lawsuit that we enter into may consume time and resources that will impair our ability to develop and market our product candidates 
we have entered into confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants  advisors and collaborators 
however  these parties may not honor these agreements and  as a result  we may not be able to protect our rights to unpatented trade secrets and know how 
others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and know how 
also  many of our scientific and management personnel were previously employed by competing companies 
as a result  such companies may allege trade secret violations and similar claims against us 
if we fail to acquire  develop and commercialize additional products or product candidates  or fail to successfully promote or market approved products  we may never achieve profitability 
as part of our business strategy  we plan to identify and acquire product candidates or approved products in areas in which we possess particular knowledge 
because we do not directly engage in basic research or drug discovery  we must rely upon third parties to sell or license product opportunities to us 
other companies  including some with substantially greater financial  marketing and sales resources  are competing with us to acquire such products 
we may not be able to acquire rights to additional products on acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition  we may acquire new products with different marketing strategies  distribution channels and bases of competition than those of our current products 
therefore  we may not be able to compete favorably in those product categories 
any of our future products may not be accepted by the market  which would limit the commercial opportunities for our products 
even if our product candidates perform successfully in clinical trials and are approved by the fda and other regulatory authorities  our future products may not achieve market acceptance and may not generate the revenues that we anticipate 
the degree of market acceptance will depend upon a number of factors  including the receipt and timing of regulatory approvals  the availability of third party reimbursement  the indications for which the product is approved  the rate of adoption by health care providers  the rate of product acceptance by target patient populations  the price of the product relative to alternative therapies  the availability of alternative therapies  the extent of marketing efforts by us and third party distributors and agents  the publicity regarding our products or similar products  and the extent and severity of side effects as compared to alternative therapies 

table of contents if we do not receive adequate third party reimbursements for any of our future products  our revenues and profitability will be reduced 
our ability to commercialize our product candidates successfully will depend  in part  on the extent to which reimbursement for the costs of such products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities  such as medicare and medicaid in the united states  private health insurers and other organizations 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of a newly approved health care product  particularly for indications for which there is no current effective treatment or for which medical care is typically not sought 
adequate third party coverage may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product research and development 
if adequate coverage and reimbursement levels are not provided by government and third party payors for use of our products  our products may fail to achieve market acceptance 
our future revenues  profitability and access to capital will be affected by the continuing efforts of governmental and private third party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care through various means 
we expect that a number of federal  state and foreign proposals will seek to control the cost of drugs through governmental regulation 
we are unsure of the form that any health care reform legislation may take or what actions federal  state  foreign and private payors may take in response to the proposed reforms 
therefore  we cannot predict the effect of any implemented reform on our business 
if product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us  we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates 
the testing and marketing of pharmaceutical products entails an inherent risk of product liability 
product liability claims might be brought against us by consumers  health care providers  pharmaceutical companies or others selling our future products 
if we cannot successfully defend ourselves against such claims  we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit the commercialization of our product candidates 
we have obtained limited product liability insurance coverage only for our human clinical trials 
however  insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive  and no assurance can be given that we will be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability 
we may not be able to obtain commercially reasonable product liability insurance for any products approved for marketing 
if a plaintiff brings a successful product liability claim against us in excess of our insurance coverage  if any  we may incur substantial liabilities and our business may fail 
we may need substantial additional funding and may not have access to capital 
if we are unable to raise capital when needed  we may need to delay  reduce or eliminate our product development or commercialization efforts 
we may need to raise additional funds to execute our business strategy 
we have incurred losses from operations since inception and we expect to incur additional operating losses 
our actual capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the progress of our research and development programs  the progress of preclinical studies  clinical and other testing  the time and cost involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the effect of competing technological and market developments  the effect of changes and developments in our collaborative  licensing and other relationships  the terms and timing of any new collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  and our ability to arrange for the commercialization of our product candidates 
we may be unable to raise sufficient funds to execute our business strategy 
in addition  we may not be able to find sufficient debt or equity funding on acceptable terms 
if we cannot  we may need to delay  reduce or eliminate research and development programs 

table of contents the sale by us of additional equity securities or the expectation that we will sell additional equity securities may have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock 
in addition  collaborative arrangements may require us to grant product development programs or licenses to third parties for products that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves 
we depend on key personnel and may not be able to retain these employees or recruit additional qualified personnel  which would harm our research and development efforts 
we are highly dependent on the efforts of our key management and scientific personnel  especially john r 
plachetka  pharmd  our chairman  president and chief executive officer 
dr 
plachetka signed an employment agreement with us on april   as amended and restated on july   for a three year term with automatic one year renewal terms 
as of july   we also entered into employment agreements with certain of our other key management personnel  each of which provides for a two year term with automatic one year renewal terms 
if we lose the services of dr 
plachetka or the services of any of our other key personnel  or are unable to replace the services of our key personnel who may leave the company  or if we fail to recruit other key scientific personnel  we may be unable to achieve our business objectives 
there is intense competition for qualified scientific personnel 
since our business is very science oriented  we need to continue to attract and retain such people 
we may not be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for developing our business 
furthermore  our future success will also depend in part on the continued service of our other key management personnel 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our proceeds from our initial public offering and private placements have been invested in money market funds that invest primarily in short term  highly rated investments  including us government securities  commercial paper and certificates of deposit guaranteed by banks 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate changes 
because of the short term maturities of our investments  we do not believe that a decrease in market rates would have a significant negative impact on the value of our investment portfolio 
however  declines in interest rates reduced our interest income in as compared to the same period of declines in interest rates will reduce our interest income while increases in interest rates will increase our interest income
