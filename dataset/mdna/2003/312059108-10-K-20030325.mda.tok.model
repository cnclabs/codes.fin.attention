introduction this discussion is intended to focus on certain financial information regarding bankshares and tfb 
the purpose of this discussion is to provide the reader with a more thorough understanding of the financial statements 
as such  this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes contained elsewhere herein 
management is not aware of any market or institutional trends  events or uncertainties that are expected to have a material effect on the liquidity  capital resources or operations of bankshares or tfb 
nor is management aware of any current recommendations by regulatory authorities that would have a material effect on liquidity  capital resources or operations 
tfb s internal sources of such liquidity are deposits  loan repayments and securities available for sale 
tfb s primary external source of liquidity is advances from the fhlb of atlanta 
critical accounting policies general 
bankshares financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the financial information contained within our statements is  to a significant extent  based on measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset or relieving a liability 
we use historical loss factors as one factor in determining the inherent loss that may be present in our loan portfolio 
actual losses could differ significantly from the historical factors that we use in our estimates 
in addition  gaap itself may change from one previously acceptable accounting method to another method 
although the economics of our transactions would be the same  the timing of events that would impact our transactions could change 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in our loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting i statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for contingencies  which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and estimable and ii sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  which requires that losses be accrued based on the differences between the value of collateral  present value of future cash flows or values that are observable in the secondary market and the loan balance 
our allowance for loan losses has three basic components the specific allowance  the formula allowance and the unallocated allowance 
each of these components is determined based upon estimates that can and do change when the actual events occur 
the specific allowance is used to individually allocate an allowance for larger balance  non homogeneous loans 
the specific allowance uses various techniques to arrive at an estimate of loss 
first  analysis of the borrower s overall financial condition  resources and payment record  the prospects for support from financial guarantors  and the fair market value of collateral are used to estimate the probability and severity of inherent losses 
additionally  the migration of historical default rates and loss severities  internal risk ratings  industry and market conditions and trends  and other environmental factors are considered 
the use of these values is inherently subjective and our actual losses could be greater or less than the estimates 
the formula allowance is used for estimating the loss on pools of smaller balance  homogeneous loans  including one to four family mortgage loans  installment loans  other consumer loans  and outstanding loan commitments 
also  the formula allowance is used for the remaining pool of larger balance  non homogeneous loans which were not allocated a specific allowance upon their review 
the formula allowance begins with estimates of probable losses inherent in the homogeneous portfolio based upon various statistical analyses 
these include analysis of historical and peer group delinquency and credit loss experience  together with analyses that reflect current trends and conditions 
we also consider trends and changes in the volume and term of loans  changes in the credit process and or lending policies and procedures  and an evaluation of overall credit quality 
the formula allowance uses a historical loss view as an indicator of future losses 
as a result  even though this history is regularly updated with the most recent loss information  it could differ from the loss incurred in the future 
the unallocated allowance captures losses that are attributable to various economic events  industry or geographic sectors whose impact on the portfolio have occurred but have yet to be recognized in either the formula or specific allowances 
in addition  an unallocated reserve is maintained to recognize the imprecision in estimating and measuring inherent losses on individual loans or pools of loans 
overview the reported results of bankshares depend on a variety of factors  including the general interest rate environment  competitive conditions in the industry  governmental policies and regulations and conditions in the markets for financial assets 
net interest income is the largest component of net income  and consists of the difference between income generated on interest earning assets and interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is primarily affected by the volume  interest rates and composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
comparison of operating results for the years ended december  and december  net income of million in was a increase from net income of million 
earnings per share eps on a fully diluted basis were in compared to in profitability as measured by return on average equity increased from in to in profitability as measured by return on average assets increased from in to in on january   tfb recovered  net of taxes  or per diluted share  from its insurance carrier for losses associated with a misappropriation of cash 
certain expenses associated with that misappropriation of cash reduced and earnings by  and  net of tax  respectively 
on december   earnings were reduced by  net of tax benefit  or per diluted share  due to an extraordinary expense associated with the early payoff of the fhlb of atlanta advances 
the restructuring of tfb s balance sheet through the early payoff of the fhlb of atlanta borrowings resulted from the greater than anticipated success of tfb s retail deposit retention campaign 
deposits grew by million  or  from december  to december  the benefit of this restructuring strategy  in addition to increasing tfb s flexibility in its asset liability management process  included the reduction of interest expense during and beyond 
the realized and anticipated reduction in interest expense is projected to more than offset the one time extraordinary expense of the early payoff 
net interest income 
total interest income decreased  or to million in from million in this decrease was primarily due to the decrease in yield on interest earning assets resulting from the declining market interest rates 
average loan balances increased from million in to million in the average yield on loans decreased to in compared with in together  there was a  decrease in interest and fee income from loans for the year compared with year on a tax equivalent basis 
average investment security balances increased million from million in to million in  primarily due to the excess liquidity generated from retail deposit growth 
the tax equivalent average yield on investments declined from in to in together  there was an increase in tax equivalent interest and dividend income on security investments of  or  from million in to million in average federal funds sold balances decreased million from million in to million in the average yield on federal funds sold declined from in to in together  there was a  decrease in federal funds sold income from to total interest expense decreased million or from to primarily due to the decrease in cost on interest bearing deposits also resulting from the declining market interest rates 
average deposit balances grew million  primarily in demand deposits and money market accounts 
the average rate on interest bearing liabilities decreased from in to in the average rate on certificates of deposit decreased from in to in interest expense on fhlb of atlanta advances decreased  from to due to the early repayment of advances in december net interest income for increased million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase resulted from an increase in total average earning assets from million in to million in  and a basis point improvement in the net interest margin 
the percentage of average earning assets to total assets decreased in to from in tfb s net interest margin increased from in to in future trends regarding net interest income are dependent on the absolute level of market interest rates  the shape of the yield curve  the amount of lost income from non performing assets  the amount of prepaying loans  the mix and amount of various deposit types  and many other factors  as well as the overall volume of interest earning assets 
these factors are individually difficult to predict  and when taken together  the uncertainty of future trends compounds 
based on management s current projections  net interest income may increase in as average interest earning assets increase  but this may be offset in part or whole by a possible contraction in tfb s net interest margin resulting from economic market conditions 
provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses was  for and  for the amount of the provision for loan loss for and was based upon management s continual evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  which encompasses the overall risk characteristics of the loan portfolio  trends in tfb s delinquent and non performing loans  estimated values of collateral  and the impact of economic conditions on borrowers 
during  tfb refined its policies  guidelines  and methods for determining the allowance for loan losses  and allocating the allowance among various loan categories 
greater weight was given to the loss history by loan category  prolonged changes in portfolio delinquency trends by loan category  and changes in economic trends 
there can be no assurances  however  that future losses will not exceed estimated amounts  or that increased amounts of provisions for loan losses will not be required in future periods 
non interest income 
total non interest income increased by  from million in to million in excluding the previously discussed non loan charge off insurance recovery of  before taxes during  total other income increased by  or 
other income is derived primarily from non interest fee income  which consists primarily of fiduciary and other wealth management fees  service charges on deposit accounts  and other fee income 
in  the increase was generated primarily from a  increase in service charges on deposit accounts 
major factors in the increase in service charges on deposit accounts were the impact of the increase in tfb s deposit base from year end to year end  as well as management s focus on meeting the needs of its customers with new value added  fee based products 
non interest expense 
total non interest expenses increased million  or in from the primary component of the increase was an increase in salaries and employees benefits of million  or  primarily due to the increase in full time equivalent personnel from approximately at year end and at year end to at year end  as well as customary annual salary increases 
significant increases in the defined benefit pension plan expense and the cost of medical insurance benefits also added to increased salary and employees benefit expense in the growth in personnel primarily reflects the expansion of the wealth management services and lending divisions  and the full year effect of the august opening of the old town manassas branch office 
in addition  occupancy expenses increased  or  from to primarily due to rent and other leasehold expenses associated with the full year effect of the old town manassas office  as well as the addition of administrative offices in alexandria pike  warrenton 
furniture and equipment increased  or  which correspond with the growth in occupancy expenses 
income taxes 
income tax expense increased by  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the effective tax rates were for and for the effective tax rate differs from the statutory federal income tax rate of due to tfb s investment in tax exempt loans and securities

the average rate on certificates of deposit increased from in to in during the fourth quarter of  many of these higher rate certificates of deposit either repriced into lower rate certificates of deposit  or transferred into lower rate now  money market account  and savings account rates 
net interest income for increased  or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase resulted from an increase in total average earning assets from million in to million in  which offset the decline in the net interest margin

the growth in personnel primarily reflects the expansion of the wealth management services division and the august opening of the old town manassas branch office 
in addition  occupancy expenses increased  or  primarily due to rent and other leasehold expenses associated with the new old town manassas office 
other operating expenses increased from million in to million in due to the prepayment penalty of  associated with the repayment of fhlb of atlanta advances offsetting the absence of investigation related expenses as a result of the misappropriation of cash 
income taxes 
income tax expense increased by  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the effective tax rates were for and for the effective tax rate differs from the statutory federal income tax rate of due to tfb s investment in tax exempt loans and securities 
comparison of december  and december  financial condition total assets were million at december   an increase of or million from million at december  balance sheet categories reflecting significant changes included investment securities  total loans  deposits  and capital securities 
each of these categories is discussed below 
investment securities 
total investment securities were million at december   reflecting an increase of million from million at december  the increase was the result of investing funds  generated by retail deposit growth  primarily into mortgage backed securities with shorter term durations of two to three years 
at december  and  all million in investment securities were available for sale 
the valuation allowance for the available for sale portfolio had an unrealized gain  net of tax  of  at december  compared with an unrealized gain  net of tax  of  at december  loans 
total net loan balance after allowance for loan losses was million at december   which represents an increase of million or from million at december  the majority of the increase was in family residential real estate loans  which increased million from to and commercial and industrial loans  except those secured by real estate  which increased million over the same time period 
the growth in family residential real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans was partially offset by the decrease in construction loans 
tfb s loans are made primarily to customers located within tfb s primary market area 
deposits 
for the year ended december   total deposits grew million or when compared with total deposits one year earlier 
noninterest bearing deposits increased by million and interest bearing deposits increased by million 
company obligated mandatorily redeemable capital securities of subsidiary trust capital securities 
on march   bankshares established a subsidiary trust that issued million of capital securities as part of a pooled trust preferred security offering with other financial institutions 
bankshares is using the offering proceeds for the purposes of expansion and the repurchase of additional shares of its common stock 
under applicable regulatory guidelines  the capital securities are treated as tier capital for purposes of the federal reserve s capital guidelines for bank holding companies  as long as the capital securities and all other cumulative preferred securities of bankshares together do not exceed of tier capital 
asset quality non performing loans  in most cases  consist of loans that are days or more past due and for which the accrual of interest has been discontinued 
management evaluates all loans that are days or more past due  as well as loans that have suffered financial distress  to determine if they should be placed on non accrual status 
factors considered by management include the estimated value of collateral  if any  and other resources of the borrower that may be available to satisfy the delinquency 
non performing loans totaled approximately  or 
of total loans at december   as compared with  or 
of total loans at december  non performing loans as a percentage of the allowance for loan losses were and at december  and  respectively 
loans that were days past due and accruing interest totaled  and  at december  and  respectively 
at december    of the  consisted of two loans secured by real estate 
no loss is anticipated on these loans 
there are no loans  other than those disclosed above as either non performing or impaired  where information known about the borrower has caused management to have serious doubts about the borrower s ability to repay 
there are no other interest bearing assets that would be subject to disclosure as either non performing or impaired if such interest bearing assets were loans 
to management s knowledge  no concentration of loans to borrowers engaged in similar activities exceeds of total loans 
capital resources and liquidity shareholders equity totaled million at december  compared with million at december  the amount of equity reflects management s desire to increase shareholders return on equity by managing the growth in equity 
during the first quarter of  bankshares initiated a dutch auction self tender offer to repurchase shares directly from shareholders 
as a result of this action  bankshares repurchased  shares  as adjusted for stock splits  or of shares outstanding on december   for million 
in addition to the dutch auction  bankshares initiated an open market buyback program in  through which it repurchased  adjusted for stock splits  an additional  shares at a cost of million in   shares at a cost of million in   shares at a cost of million in   shares at a cost of million in  and  shares at a cost of million in the securities portfolio valuation account increased its unrealized gain after tax to  at december  compared to an unrealized gain of  at december  as discussed above under comparison of december  and december  financial condition  on march   bankshares established a subsidiary trust that issued million of capital securities as part of a pooled trust preferred security offering with other financial institutions 
under applicable regulatory guidelines  the capital securities are treated as tier capital for purposes of the federal reserve s capital guidelines for bank holding companies  as long as the capital securities and all other cumulative preferred securities of bankshares together do not exceed of tier capital 
as discussed above under government supervision and regulation  banking regulations have established minimum capital requirements for financial institutions  including risk based capital ratios and leveraged ratios 
as of december   the appropriate regulatory authorities have categorized bankshares and tfb as well capitalized 
the primary sources of funds are deposits  repayment of loans  maturities of investments  funds provided from operations and advances from the fhlb of atlanta 
while scheduled repayments of loans and maturities of investment securities are predictable sources of funds  deposit flows and loan repayments are greatly influenced by the general level of interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
tfb uses its sources of funds to fund existing and future loan commitments  to fund maturing certificates of deposit and demand deposit withdrawals  to invest in other interest earning assets  to maintain liquidity  and to meet operating expenses 
management monitors projected liquidity needs and determines the desirable funding level based in part on tfb s commitments to make loans and management s assessment of tfb s ability to generate funds 
cash and amounts due from depository institutions and federal funds sold totaled million at december  compared with million at december  these assets provide the primary source of liquidity for tfb 
in addition  management has designated the entire investment portfolio  approximately million  as available for sale  and has an available line of credit with the fhlb of atlanta with a borrowing limit of approximately million at december  to provide additional sources of liquidity 
at december   million of the fhlb of atlanta line of credit was in use

loans are charged off when deemed by management to be uncollectable  after taking into consideration such factors as the current financial condition of the customer and the underlying collateral and guarantees 
bankshares adopted fasb statement no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
this statement has been amended by fasb no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures 
fasb statement no 
 as amended  requires that the impairment of loans that have been separately identified for evaluation is to be measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows or  alternatively  the observable market price of the loans or the fair value of the collateral 
however  for those loans that are collateral dependent that is  if repayment of those loans is expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral and for which management has determined foreclosure is probable  the measure of impairment is to be based on the fair value of the collateral 
fasb statement no 
 as amended also requires certain disclosures about investments in impaired loans and the allowance for loan losses and interest income recognized on loans 
a loan is considered impaired when it is probable that tfb will be unable to collect all principal and interest amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
factors involved in determining impairment include  but are not limited to  expected future cash flows  financial condition of the borrower  and the current economic conditions 
a performing loan may be considered impaired if the factors above indicate a need for impairment 
a loan on non accrual status may not be impaired if it is in the process of collection or if the shortfall in payment is insignificant 
a delay of less than days or a shortfall of less than of the required principal and interest payments generally is considered insignificant and would not indicate an impairment situation  if in management s judgement the loan will be paid in full 
loans that meet the regulatory definitions of doubtful or loss generally qualify as impaired loans under fasb statement no 
charge offs for impaired loans occur when the loan or portion of the loan is determined to be uncollectible  as is the case for all loans 
bankshares considers all consumer installment loans and residential mortgage loans to be homogenous loans 
these loans are not subject to individual impairment under fasb statement no 
loans are placed on non accrual status when they have been specifically determined to be impaired or when principal or interest is delinquent for days or more  unless the loans are well secured and in the process of collection 
any unpaid interest previously accrued on such loans is reversed from income 
interest income generally is not recognized on specific impaired loans unless the likelihood of further loss is remote 
interest payments received on such loans are applied as a reduction of the loan principal balance 
interest income on other non accrual loans is recognized only to the extent of interest payments received 
total loans on the balance sheet are comprised of the following classifications as of december      and loan portfolio in thousands december  loans secured by real estate construction      secured by farmland    family residential      commercial real estate      commercial and industrial loans except those secured by real estate      consumer loans to individuals except those secured by real estate      all other loans      total loans      less unearned discount total loans  net of unearned discount      the following table sets forth certain information with respect to tfb s non accrual  restructured and past due loans  as well as foreclosed assets  for the periods indicated non performing assets and loans contractually past due in thousands years ended december  nonaccrual loans restructured loans other real estate owned total non performing assets loans past due days accruing interest allowance for loan losses to total loans at period end non performing assets to period end loans and other real estate owned potential problem loans at december   management is not aware of any significant problem loans not included in table 
summary of loan loss experience analysis of loan loss experience 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level which  in management s judgement  is adequate to absorb credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the amount of the allowance is based on management s evaluation of the collectibility of the loan portfolio  credit concentration  trends in historical loss experience  specific impaired loans  and current economic conditions 
management periodically reviews the loan portfolio to determine probable credit losses related to specifically identified loans as well as credit losses inherent in the remainder of the loan portfolio 
allowances for impaired loans are generally determined based on collateral values or the present value of estimated cash flows 
the allowance is increased by a provision for loan losses  which is charged to expense and reduced by charge offs  net of recoveries 
changes in the allowances relating to impaired loans are charged or credited to the provision for loan losses 
because of uncertainties inherent in the estimation process  management s estimate of credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio and the related allowance remains subject to change 
additions to the allowance for loan losses  recorded as the provision for loan losses on bankshares statements of income  are made monthly to maintain the allowance at an appropriate level based on management s analysis of the inherent risk in the loan portfolio 
the amount of the provision is a function of the level of loans outstanding  the level of non performing loans  historical loan loss experience  the amount of loan losses actually charged off or recovered during a given period and current national and local economic conditions

capital bankshares and tfb are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that could have a direct material effect on bankshares financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  bankshares and tfb must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
bankshares and tfb s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors 
quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require bankshares and tfb to maintain minimum amounts and ratios set forth in the table below of total and tier i capital as defined in the regulations to risk weighted assets as defined in the regulations  and of tier i capital to average assets as defined in the regulations 
management believes  as of december  that bankshares and tfb more than satisfy all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject 
bankshares and tfb exceeded their regulatory capital ratios  as set forth in the following table risk based capital ratios in thousands december  tier capital shareholders equity   less unrealized gain on securities available for sale less intangible assets  net plus company obligated madatorily redeemable capital securities  total tier capital   tier capital allowable allowance for loan losses   total capital   risk weighted assets   risk based capital ratios tier to risk weighted assets total capital to risk weighted assets impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes presented elsewhere in this document  have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time and due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of bankshares and tfb are monetary in nature 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of operations 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than inflation does 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk an important component of both earnings performance and liquidity is management of interest rate sensitivity 
interest rate sensitivity reflects the potential effect on net interest income and economic value of equity from a change in market interest rates 
tfb is subject to interest rate sensitivity to the degree that its interest earning assets mature or reprice at different time intervals than its interest bearing liabilities 
however  tfb is not subject to the other major categories of market risk such as foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity price risk 
tfb uses a number of tools to manage its interest rate risk  including simulating net interest income under various scenarios  monitoring the present value change in equity under the same scenarios  and monitoring the difference or gap between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities over various time periods 
management believes that rate risk is best measured by simulation modeling 
the earnings simulation model forecasts annual net income under a variety of scenarios that incorporate changes in the absolute level of interest rates  changes in the shape of the yield curve  and changes in interest rate relationships 
management evaluates the effect on net interest income and present value equity under varying market rate assumptions 
tfb monitors exposure to instantaneous changes in rates of up to basis points up or down over a rolling month period 
tfb s policy limit for the maximum negative impact on net interest income and change in equity from instantaneous changes in interest rates of basis points over months is and  respectively 
management has maintained a risk position well within these guideline levels during the following tables present tfb s market value changes in equity under various rate scenarios as of december  and market risk percentage market minus current plus market percentage change value change pts fair value pts value change change federal funds sold    securities     loans receivable      total rate sensitive assets      other assets    total assets      demand deposits      rate bearing deposits      borrowed funds      other liabilities    total liabilities      present value equity     total liabilities and equity      percentage market minus current plus market percentage dollars in thousands change value change pts fair value pts value change change federal funds sold    securities      loans receivable      total rate sensitive assets      other assets    total assets      demand deposits      rate bearing deposits      borrowed funds    other liabilities    total liabilities      present value equity      total liabilities and equity
