results of operations 
certain factors affecting results of operations 
the company s results of operations may be materially affected by market fluctuations and by economic factors 
in addition  results of operations in the past have been  and in the future may continue to be  materially affected by many factors of a global nature  including political  economic and market conditions  the availability and cost of capital  the level and volatility of equity prices  commodity prices and interest rates  currency values and other market indices  technological changes and events  the availability and cost of credit  inflation  and investor sentiment and confidence in the financial markets 
in addition  there has been a heightened level of legislative  legal and regulatory developments related to the financial services industry that may affect future results of operations 
such factors also may have an impact on the company s ability to achieve its strategic objectives on a global basis  including without limitation increased market share in all of its businesses  growth in assets under management and expansion of its credit services business 
the company s institutional securities business  particularly its involvement in primary and secondary markets for all types of financial products  including derivatives  is subject to substantial positive and negative fluctuations due to a variety of factors that cannot be predicted with great certainty  including variations in the fair value of securities and other financial products and the volatility and liquidity of global trading markets 
fluctuations also occur due to the level of global market activity  which  among other things  affects the size  this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements as well as a discussion of some of the risks and uncertainties involved in the company s businesses that could affect the matters referred to in such statements 
logo 
table of contents number  and timing of investment banking client assignments and transactions and the realization of returns from the company s principal investments 
such factors also affect the level of individual investor participation in the financial markets  which impacts the results of the individual investor group 
the level of global market activity also could impact the flow of investment capital into or from assets under management and supervision and the way in which such capital is allocated among money market  equity  fixed income or other investment alternatives  which could cause fluctuations to occur in the company s investment management business 
in the company s credit services business  changes in economic variables  such as the number and size of personal bankruptcy filings  the rate of unemployment  and the level of consumer confidence and consumer debt  may substantially affect consumer loan levels and credit quality  which  in turn  could impact the results of credit services 
the company s results of operations also may be materially affected by competitive factors 
included among the principal competitive factors affecting the institutional securities and individual investor group businesses are the company s reputation  the quality of its professionals and other personnel  its products  services and advice  capital commitments  relative pricing and innovation 
competition in the company s investment management business is affected by a number of factors  including investment objectives  relative performance of investment products  advertising and sales promotion efforts  fee levels  distribution channels  and types and quality of services offered 
in the credit services business  competition centers on merchant acceptance of credit cards  account acquisition and customer utilization of credit cards  all of which are impacted by the types of fees  interest rates and other features offered 
besides competition from firms traditionally engaged in the financial services business  competition has continued to increase from other sources  such as commercial banks  insurance companies  sponsors of mutual funds and other companies offering financial services in the us  globally and through the internet 
the financial services industry has experienced consolidation and convergence  as financial institutions involved in a broad range of financial services industries have merged 
such convergence may continue and could result in the company s competitors gaining greater capital and other resources  such as a broader range of products and services and geographic diversity 
in addition  the company has experienced competition for qualified employees 
the company s ability to sustain or improve its competitive position will substantially depend on its ability to continue to attract and retain qualified employees while managing compensation costs 
as a result of the above economic and competitive factors  net income and revenues in any particular period may not be representative of full year results and may vary significantly from year to year and from quarter to quarter 
the company intends to manage its business for the long term and to mitigate the potential effects of market downturns by strengthening its competitive position in the global financial services industry through diversification of its revenue sources  enhancement of its global franchise  and management of costs and its capital structure 
the company s overall financial results will continue to be affected by its ability and success in addressing client goals  maintaining high levels of profitable business activities  emphasizing fee based products that are designed to generate a continuing stream of revenues  evaluating credit product pricing  managing risks  costs and its capital position  and maintaining its strong reputation and franchise 
in addition  the complementary trends in the financial services industry of consolidation and globalization present  among other things  technological  risk management and other infrastructure challenges that will require effective resource allocation in order for the company to remain competitive 
global market and economic conditions in fiscal the difficult global market and economic conditions that existed during fiscal deteriorated further throughout fiscal although fiscal began amid increased expectations of improved economic performance  the anticipated recovery never materialized  and global economic growth remained sluggish 
in addition  weak corporate earnings and the emergence of numerous corporate accounting and governance irregularities undermined investor confidence  and the majority of global equity markets experienced sharp declines during fiscal uncertainty surrounding lingering terrorist threats and increased geopolitical logo 
table of contents tensions also contributed to investors becoming increasingly risk averse 
it currently is uncertain when these market and economic conditions will improve 
these conditions adversely affected the company s fiscal results of operations  as the revenues of the company s institutional securities  individual investor group and investment management business segments declined from the levels achieved in fiscal the company s institutional securities business recorded lower revenues from its investment banking and sales and trading activities in fiscal as compared with fiscal the company s individual investor group business continued to be adversely affected by low levels of retail investor participation in the equity markets  while the decline in revenues in the company s investment management business reflected a decrease in customer assets under management or supervision and a shift toward investment allocations perceived to contain lower risk 
in the us  market and economic conditions remained difficult during fiscal despite generally resilient consumer spending  economic growth continued to be sluggish 
the unemployment rate remained at a relatively high level  and investors continued to be concerned with weak corporate earnings and increased uncertainty about the strength and pace of the global economic recovery 
in addition  investor confidence weakened due to increased concerns regarding the quality of corporate financial reporting and accounting practices  corporate governance  unethical or illegal corporate practices and several significant corporate bankruptcies 
these developments  coupled with increased geopolitical unrest  created difficult conditions in us financial markets 
us equity markets declined for the third consecutive year  the first time that has occurred since the s 
in response to these conditions  during fiscal the federal reserve board the fed eased interest rates in order to stimulate economic activity 
in two separate actions  the fed lowered both the overnight lending rate and the discount rate by an aggregate of 
the securities and exchange commission the sec also responded by  among other things  requiring chief executive officers and chief financial officers of companies with large market capitalization to certify the accuracy of certain prior financial reports and other sec filings 
in addition  the sarbanes oxley act of was enacted  which includes broad legislation affecting public companies with provisions covering corporate governance and management  new disclosure requirements  oversight of the accounting profession and auditor independence 
economic and market conditions also were difficult in europe during fiscal economic growth was generally sluggish  reflecting weak industrial production and the impact of difficult conditions existing in the global economy 
in germany  the region s largest economy  growth was adversely impacted by a relatively high unemployment rate and weak industrial production and job creation 
as a result  the majority of equity market indices within the region declined during fiscal during the year  the european central bank ecb left the benchmark interest rate within the region unchanged 
subsequent to fiscal year end  in december  the ecb lowered the benchmark interest rate within the european union by 
in the uk  inflation and unemployment were generally stable  and consumer spending was relatively strong 
however  equity prices in the uk declined during fiscal the bank of england left the benchmark interest rate unchanged during the year 
economies in the far east  which are heavily dependent on export levels  also were adversely impacted by the sluggish performance of the us economy during fiscal in japan  although the level of economic activity improved  economic growth was subdued  and the prospects for continued recovery still were uncertain in light of the difficult conditions existing throughout the global economy 
in addition  lingering concerns over the banking sector  including the level of non performing bank loans  and deflationary pressures negatively impacted the nation s economy 
consumer spending remained weak  reflecting a relatively high unemployment rate and low consumer confidence 
as a result  japanese equity markets declined during fiscal certain nations elsewhere in the far east experienced an improvement in the level of exports and manufacturing output 
however  their prospects for continued recovery will be largely dependent on developments elsewhere in the world  particularly in the us the decline in the worldwide market for mergers and acquisitions that began in mid continued during fiscal the number of transactions and the average transaction size fell significantly during fiscal as compared with fiscal however  transaction activity continued to be diverse in terms of regional and logo 
table of contents industry breadth  reflecting the continuing need for consolidation and globalization in a variety of industries  including consumer products  health care  financial services and general industrial business sectors 
the market for merger and acquisition transactions was adversely affected by weakened investor confidence in light of several significant corporate accounting irregularities and bankruptcies  weak corporate earnings and declines in the global equity markets 
in addition  many companies continued to respond to the difficult market and economic conditions by focusing on cost reduction instead of expansion 
the worldwide market for equity underwriting transactions was adversely affected by the uncertainty in the global financial markets  which contributed to a significant decline in transaction volume as compared with the prior year 
between mid august and the second week of october  there were no initial public offerings ipos in the us equity markets  the first time this has occurred since according to thomson financial 
the market for fixed income underwritings also was more difficult in fiscal as compared with fiscal  primarily due to lower transaction volumes resulting from an overall market slowdown coupled with increased competitive pressures 
us consumer demand and spending continued its resiliency throughout much of fiscal  stimulated by historically low interest rates that lowered borrowing costs and increased mortgage refinancings 
however  due to reduced personal wealth  relatively high unemployment  declining equity prices  and general economic and geopolitical concerns  consumer demand and spending moderated as fiscal concluded 
in addition  there was a continued rise in personal bankruptcy filings during fiscal fiscal and fiscal results of the company 
the company recorded net income of  million in fiscal  a decrease from fiscal in fiscal  the company s net income was  million  a decrease of from fiscal fiscal s net income included an extraordinary loss of million associated with the early extinguishment of certain long term borrowings and a charge of million for the cumulative effect of an accounting change associated with the company s adoption  on december   of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
excluding the extraordinary item and the cumulative effect of the accounting change  the company s net income for fiscal was below the comparable period of fiscal excluding the extraordinary item and the cumulative effect of the accounting change  the company s net income for fiscal was below the comparable period of fiscal the company s effective income tax rate was  and in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal primarily reflected lower tax rates attributable to non us earnings 
the effective tax rate in fiscal was relatively unchanged from the prior year 
basic earnings per common share decreased to in fiscal and decreased to in fiscal excluding the extraordinary loss and the impact of the cumulative effect of an accounting change noted above  fiscal s basic earnings per common share were 
diluted earnings per common share decreased to in fiscal and decreased to in fiscal excluding the extraordinary loss and the impact of the cumulative effect of an accounting change  fiscal s diluted earnings per common share were 
the company s return on average common shareholders equity excluding the extraordinary loss and the cumulative effect of the accounting change for fiscal was  and in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
in light of the declines in the global financial markets over the past few years  the company contributed approximately million to its defined benefit pension plans during fiscal these contributions were logo 
table of contents funded with cash from operations and were recorded as a component of prepaid pension benefit cost in the company s consolidated statements of financial condition 
in addition  the company  in consultation with its independent actuaries  lowered its expected long term rate of return on plan assets from to for fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the impact of this change was not material to the company s consolidated results of operations in fiscal the impact of the company s cash contributions in fiscal  coupled with a lower expected long term rate of return on plan assets for fiscal  is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations in fiscal at november   the company had approximately  employees worldwide  a decrease of from november  the reduction in staffing levels reflected the company s continued efforts to manage costs in light of the weakened global economy and reduced business activity 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company had workforce reductions of approximately  employees see restructuring and other charges herein 
restructuring and other charges 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recognized restructuring and other charges of million pre tax 
the charge reflects several actions that were intended to resize and refocus certain business areas in order to address the difficult conditions currently existing in the global financial markets 
such conditions  including significantly lower levels of investment banking activity and decreased retail investor participation in the equity markets  have had an adverse impact on the company s results of operations  particularly in its institutional securities and individual investor group businesses 
this charge  which is recorded as restructuring and other charges on the company s consolidated statements of income  consisted of space related costs of million and severance related costs of million 
the space related costs were attributable to the closure or subletting of excess office space  primarily in the us and the us  as well as the company s decision to consolidate its individual investor group branch locations 
the majority of the space related costs consisted of rental charges and the write off of furniture  fixtures and other fixed assets at the affected office locations 
the severance related costs were attributable to workforce reductions 
the company reduced the number of its employees by approximately  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  primarily in the institutional securities and individual investor group businesses 
the majority of the severance related costs consisted of severance payments and outplacement costs provided to the affected individuals 
the restructuring and other charges were included in the institutional securities million  individual investor group million and investment management million business segments 
the company expects that these actions will yield pre tax savings of approximately million in fiscal approximately million of these expected savings relate to reduced employee related costs  which will be recognized within compensation and benefits expenses in the company s consolidated statements of income 
the remainder of the expected savings for fiscal relate to lower facilities costs  which will be recognized within occupancy and equipment expenses 
subsequent to fiscal  the company will continue to recognize lower occupancy and equipment expenses as a result of its decision to reduce its office space 
however  the changes in these and other operating expenses from period to period have been  and will continue to be  affected by the company s management of its costs in light of the overall level of business activity and other business initiatives 
the majority of the workforce reductions were completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal the consolidation of branch locations and other space related actions are expected to be substantially completed by the second quarter of fiscal the company expects that the remaining space related payments and severance related payments will be funded by cash from operations 
recent developments 
on december   the company and other financial services firms reached an agreement in principle with the sec  the new york state attorney general s office  the new york stock exchange  inc nyse  the national association of securities dealers  inc and the north american securities administrators association logo 
table of contents on behalf of state securities regulators to resolve their investigations relating to alleged research analyst conflicts of interest 
the agreement resolved the investigations as to the company and the other firms but not as to individuals within the firms 
pursuant to the agreement in principle  the company  without admitting or denying the allegations  agreed i to pay million in retrospective relief and ii to adopt internal structural and operational practices that will further enhance the steps it already has taken to help ensure research analyst integrity and promote investor confidence 
in addition  the company agreed to provide independent third party research to clients and to pay million over five years to fund such research 
the costs of the agreement in principle have been provided for in the company s consolidated financial statements 
business acquisitions  business disposition and asset dispositions 
in fiscal  the company sold its self directed online brokerage accounts to bank of montreal s harrisdirect 
the transaction closed during the third quarter of fiscal the company recorded gross proceeds of approximately million included within other revenues and related costs of approximately million included within non interest expenses in the individual investor group business segment 
in fiscal  the company recorded a pre tax gain of million related to the sale of a million square foot office tower in new york city that had been under construction since the pre tax gain is included within the institutional securities million  individual investor group million and investment management million business segments 
the allocation was based upon occupancy levels originally planned for the building 
in fiscal  the company acquired quilter holdings limited quilter  a uk based private client investment management business providing segregated account management and advisory services to individuals  pension funds and trusts 
the company s fiscal results include the operations of quilter since march   the date of acquisition 
in fiscal  the company acquired ansett worldwide aviation services ansett worldwide  one of the world s leading aircraft leasing groups  leasing new and used commercial jet aircraft to airlines around the world 
the company s fiscal results include the operations of ansett worldwide since april   the date of acquisition 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company sold its global custody business to the chase manhattan corporation chase 
at that time  the company recorded a pre tax gain of million from the sale 
such gain included estimates for certain payments and purchase price adjustments which  under certain circumstances pursuant to the sales agreement  were payable by the company to chase 
as a result of the resolution of these payments and purchase price adjustments  the company recorded an additional pre tax gain of million related to the sale of its global custody business in fiscal business segments 
the remainder of results of operations is presented on a business segment basis 
substantially all of the operating revenues and operating expenses of the company can be directly attributed to its business segments institutional securities  individual investor group  investment management and credit services 
certain revenues and expenses have been allocated to each business segment  generally in proportion to their respective revenues or other relevant measures 
previously  the results of the company s institutional and individual securities activities were aggregated into one reporting segment 
in addition  the investment management business segment includes the company s private equity activities 
prior to fiscal  private equity activities were included within the company s institutional securities business segment 
the segment data for all periods presented have been restated to reflect these changes 
logo 
table of contents allocation decisions in global financial services businesses are by their nature complex and subjective and involve a high degree of judgment 
management currently is evaluating the segment allocation methodology  and the effect of any changes may be material to a particular segment 
therefore  business segment results in the future may reflect reallocations of revenues and expenses that result from such changes 
reallocations of revenues or expenses among segments will have no effect on the company s overall results of operations 
a substantial portion of the company s compensation expense represents performance based bonuses  which are determined at the end of the company s fiscal year 
the segment allocation of these bonuses reflects  among other factors  the overall performance of the company as well as the performance of individual business units 
the timing and magnitude of changes in the company s bonus accruals can have a significant effect on segment operating results in a given period 
certain reclassifications have been made to prior period segment amounts to conform to the current year s presentation 
critical accounting policies 
the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  which require the company to make estimates and assumptions see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies see note to the consolidated financial statements  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
fair value 
financial instruments owned of billion and financial instruments sold  not yet purchased of billion at november   which include cash and derivative products  are recorded at fair value in the consolidated statements of financial condition  and gains and losses are reflected in principal trading revenues in the consolidated statements of income 
fair value is the amount at which financial instruments could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties  other than in a forced or distressed sale 
the price transparency of the particular product will determine the degree of judgment involved in determining the fair value of the company s financial instruments 
price transparency is affected by a wide variety of factors  including  for example  the type of product  whether it is a new product and not yet established in the marketplace  and the characteristics particular to the transaction 
products for which actively quoted prices or pricing parameters are available or for which fair value is derived from actively quoted prices or pricing parameters will generally have a higher degree of price transparency 
by contrast  products that are thinly or not quoted will generally have reduced to no price transparency 
even in normally active markets  the price transparency for actively quoted instruments may be reduced for periods of time during periods of market dislocation 
alternatively  in thinly quoted markets  the participation of market makers willing to purchase and sell a product provides a source of transparency for products that otherwise are not actively quoted or during periods of market dislocation 
a substantial percentage of the fair value of the company s financial instruments owned and financial instruments sold  not yet purchased  is based on observable market prices  observable market parameters  or is derived from such prices or parameters 
the availability of observable market prices and pricing parameters can vary from product to product 
where available  observable market prices and pricing parameters in a product or a related product may be used to derive a price without requiring significant judgment 
in certain markets  observable market prices or market parameters are not available for all products  and fair value is determined using techniques appropriate for each particular product 
these analyses may involve a degree of judgment 
the company s cash products include securities issued by the us government and its agencies and instrumentalities  other sovereign debt obligations  corporate and other debt securities  corporate equity securities  exchange traded funds and physical commodities 
the fair value of these products is based principally on observable market prices or is derived from observable market parameters 
these products generally do not entail a significant degree of judgment in determining fair value 
examples of products for which actively quoted prices or pricing parameters are available or for which fair value is derived from actively quoted prices or logo 
table of contents pricing parameters include securities issued by the us government and its agencies and instrumentalities  exchange traded corporate equity securities  most municipal debt securities  most corporate debt securities  most high yield debt securities  physical commodities  certain traded loan products and most mortgage backed securities 
by contrast  some cash products exhibit little or no price transparency  and the determination of the fair value requires more judgment 
examples of cash products with little or no price transparency include certain high yield debt  certain collateralized mortgage obligations  certain traded loan products  distressed debt securities ie  securities of issuers encountering financial difficulties  including bankruptcy or insolvency and equity securities that are not publicly traded 
generally  the fair value of these types of cash products is determined using one of several valuation techniques appropriate for the product  which can include cash flow analysis  revenue or net income analysis  default recovery analysis ie  analysis of the likelihood of default and the potential for recovery and other analyses applied consistently 
at november   the fair value of cash products with little or no price transparency recorded in financial instruments owned and financial instruments sold  not yet purchased was billion and billion  respectively 
the company s derivative products include listed and over the counter otc derivatives 
listed derivatives have valuation attributes similar to the cash products valued using observable market prices or market parameters described above 
fair values for listed derivatives recorded as financial instruments owned and financial instruments sold  not yet purchased amounted to billion and billion  respectively  at november  otc derivatives included a wide variety of instruments  such as interest rate swap and option contracts  foreign currency option contracts  credit and equity swap and option contracts  and commodity swap and option contracts 
fair values for otc derivative products recorded as financial instruments owned and financial instruments sold  not yet purchased  which amounted to billion and billion  respectively  at november   were derived from pricing models 
the fair value of otc derivative contracts is derived from pricing models  which may require multiple market input parameters 
this technique is deemed more reliable than subjective adjustment to prices obtained for similar instruments 
the company relies on pricing models as a valuation methodology to determine fair value for otc derivative products because market convention is to quote input parameters to models rather than prices  not because of a lack of an active trading market 
the term model typically refers to a mathematical calculation methodology based on accepted financial theories 
depending on the product and the terms of the transaction  the fair value of otc derivative products can be modeled using a series of techniques  including closed form analytic formulae  such as the black scholes option pricing model  simulation models or a combination thereof  applied consistently 
in the case of more established derivative products  the pricing models used by the company are widely accepted by the financial services industry 
pricing models take into account the contract terms  including the maturity  as well as quoted market parameters such as interest rates  volatility and the creditworthiness of the counterparty 
many pricing models do not entail material subjectivity because the methodologies employed do not necessitate significant judgment and the pricing inputs are observed from actively quoted markets  as is the case for generic interest rate swap and option contracts 
a substantial majority of otc derivative products valued by the company using pricing models falls into this category 
other derivative products  typically the newest and most complex products  will require more judgment in the implementation of the modeling technique applied due to the reduced price transparency surrounding the model s market parameters 
the company manages its market exposure for otc derivative products primarily by entering into offsetting derivative contracts or related financial instruments 
the company s trading divisions and the market risk department continuously monitor the price changes of the otc derivatives in relation to the hedges 
for a further discussion of the price transparency of the company s otc derivative products  see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management credit risk in part ii  item a 
the company employs control processes to validate the fair value of its financial instruments  including those derived from pricing models 
these control processes are designed to assure that the prices used for financial logo 
table of contents reporting are based on observable market prices or market based parameters wherever possible 
in the event that market prices or parameters are not available  the control processes are designed to assure that the valuation approach utilized is appropriate and the assumptions are reasonable 
these control processes include periodic review of the pricing model s theoretical soundness and appropriateness by company personnel with relevant expertise who are independent from the trading divisions 
additionally  groups independent from the trading divisions within the controllers and market risk departments participate in the review and validation of the fair values generated from pricing models  as appropriate 
where a pricing model utilizes historical and statistical analysis to determine fair value  recently executed comparable transactions are considered for purposes of validating assumptions underlying the model 
where the fair value of the transaction deviates significantly from the fair value derived from the model  the transaction fair value will be used to further refine the model s input or statistical techniques in determining fair value in future periods 
consistent with market practice  the company has individually negotiated agreements with certain counterparties to exchange collateral margining based on the level of fair values of the derivative contracts they have executed 
through this margining process  one party or both parties to a derivative contract provides the other party with information about the fair value of the derivative contract to calculate the amount of collateral required 
this sharing of fair value information provides additional validation of the company s recorded fair value for the relevant otc derivative products 
for certain otc derivative products  the company  along with other market participants  contributes derivative pricing information to aggregation services that synthesize the data and make it accessible to subscribers 
this information further validates the fair value of these otc derivative products

transfers of financial assets 
the company engages in securitization activities in connection with certain of its businesses 
gains and losses from securitizations are recognized in the consolidated statements of income when the company relinquishes control of the transferred financial assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities a replacement of fasb statement no 
and other related pronouncements 
the gain or loss on the sale of financial assets depends in part on the previous carrying amount of the assets involved in the transfer  allocated between the assets sold and the retained interests based upon their respective fair values at the date of sale 
in connection with its institutional securities business  the company engages in securitization transactions to facilitate client needs and as a means of selling financial assets 
the company recognizes any interests in the transferred assets and any liabilities incurred in securitization transactions in its consolidated statements of financial condition at fair value 
subsequently  changes in the fair value of such interests are recognized in the consolidated statements of income 
the use of different pricing models or assumptions could produce different financial results 
in connection with its credit services business  the company periodically sells consumer loans through asset securitizations and continues to service these loans 
the present value of the future net servicing revenues that the company estimates it will receive over the term of the securitized loans is recognized in income as the loans are securitized 
a corresponding asset also is recorded and then amortized as a charge to income over the term of the securitized loans 
the securitization gain or loss involves the company s best estimates of key assumptions  including forecasted credit losses  payment rates  forward yield curves and appropriate discount rates 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different financial results 
allowance for consumer loan losses 
the allowance for consumer loan losses in the company s credit services business is established through a charge to the provision for consumer loan losses 
provisions are made to reserve for estimated losses in outstanding loan balances 
the allowance for consumer loan losses is a significant estimate that represents management s estimate of probable losses inherent in the consumer loan portfolio 
the allowance for consumer loan losses is an allowance applicable to the owned homogeneous consumer credit card loan portfolio that is evaluated quarterly for adequacy 
logo 
table of contents in calculating the allowance for consumer loan losses  the company uses a systematic and consistently applied approach 
the amount of the allowance is established through a process that begins with estimates of the losses inherent in the consumer loan portfolio based on coverage of a rolling average of historical credit losses 
in addition  the company regularly performs a migration analysis a technique used to estimate the likelihood that a consumer loan will progress through the various stages of delinquency and ultimately charge off of delinquent and current consumer credit card accounts in order to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for consumer loan losses 
the migration analysis considers uncollectible principal  interest and fees reflected in consumer loans 
in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for consumer loan losses  management also considers factors that may impact future credit loss experience  including current economic conditions  recent trends in delinquencies and bankruptcy filings  account seasoning  loan volume and amounts  payment rates and forecasting uncertainties 
a provision for consumer loan losses is charged against earnings to maintain the allowance for consumer loan losses at an appropriate level 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different provisions for consumer loan losses see credit services provision for consumer loan losses herein

aircraft under operating leases are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  the company s aircraft are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the aircraft may not be recoverable 
under sfas no 
 the carrying value of an aircraft may not be recoverable if its projected undiscounted cash flows are less than its carrying value 
if an aircraft s projected undiscounted cash flows are less than its carrying value  an impairment charge based on the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the aircraft is recognized 
the fair value of the company s impaired aircraft is based upon valuation information obtained from independent appraisal companies 
estimates of future cash flows associated with the aircraft assets as well as the appraisals of fair value are critical to the determination of whether an impairment exists and the amount of the impairment charge  if any see note to the consolidated financial statements

the increase in foreign exchange revenues reflected higher levels of customer trading volumes and volatility in the foreign exchange markets in both the us and europe 
the higher level of volatility in the foreign exchange markets primarily reflected the fed s interest rate actions during fiscal and the euro s rally relative to the us dollar during the first half of fiscal commodity revenues increased to a record level in fiscal  primarily driven by higher revenues from electricity and natural gas trading  which benefited from periods of heightened price volatility 
the volatility in electricity and natural gas prices primarily resulted from periodic regional energy shortages  as well as fluctuations in demand due to changing weather conditions 
higher revenues from metals trading also contributed to the increase in fiscal  as these markets rallied after september  the decline in revenues from global high yield securities reflected the adverse impact of the difficult market and economic conditions that existed during fiscal on certain high yield issuers  which resulted in markdowns of certain positions

in both years  these increases were partially offset by higher credit losses resulting from a higher rate of charge offs related to the securitized portfolio 
the increase in servicing fees in fiscal was impacted by an increase in cardmember fee revenue associated with higher levels of average securitized general purpose credit card loans 
in fiscal  higher credit losses were impacted by a higher level of average securitized general purpose credit card loans 
the other revenue component of servicing fees is primarily composed of net securitization gains and losses on general purpose credit card loans and mortgage loans as well as gains and losses on mortgage whole loan sales and related mortgage loan servicing fees 
net securitization gains on general purpose credit card loans of million and million were recorded in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
approximately million of the decrease was attributable to lower levels of general purpose credit card securitization transactions in fiscal the decrease in net securitization gains also reflected modifications to certain assumptions in the gain calculations made during fiscal  which increased the gain on general purpose credit card loans in fiscal by approximately million 
the assumptions modified by the company in fiscal were the net interest rate spread and the net charge off rate 
the assumed net interest rate spread increased  reflecting the projection of a lower interest rate environment and the resulting lower interest expense ie  cost of funding on variable rate securitizations  partially offset by an estimated lower yield on credit card receivables attributable to estimated lower interest rates and higher charge offs of interest 
the assumed net charge off rate increased  reflecting an increase in the projected charge off rate attributable to weakening economic conditions and its impact on the company s credit card portfolio 
net securitization gains on mortgage loans and gains on mortgage whole loan sales of million and million were recorded in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the million increase was attributable to higher levels of mortgage whole loan sales driven by a higher level of mortgage loan originations 
net interest income 
net interest income represents the difference between interest revenue derived from consumer loans and short term investment assets and interest expense incurred to finance those loans and assets 
assets  consisting primarily of consumer loans  currently earn interest revenue at both fixed rates and market indexed variable rates 
the company incurs interest expense at fixed and floating rates 
interest expense also includes the effects of any interest rate contracts entered into by the company as part of its interest rate risk management program 
this program is designed to reduce the volatility of earnings resulting from changes in interest rates by having a financing portfolio that reflects the existing repricing schedules of consumer loans as well as the company s right  with notice to cardmembers  to reprice certain fixed rate consumer loans to a new interest rate in the future 
net interest income in fiscal increased slightly from the prior year period 
in fiscal  a decline in interest expense and an increase in general purpose credit card loans were offset by a lower yield on these loans 
the lower yield on general purpose credit card loans was primarily due to lower interest rates offered to new logo 
table of contents cardmembers and certain existing cardmembers  as well as higher charge offs of interest

the lower yield on general purpose credit card loans was primarily due to lower interest rates offered to new cardmembers and certain existing cardmembers  as well as higher charge offs of interest 
the decrease in the yield was partially offset by the company s repricing of certain credit card receivables 
the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to a lower level of interest bearing liabilities  coupled with a decrease in the company s average cost of borrowings  which reflected the fed s aggressive interest rate easing during fiscal the company s average cost of borrowings was for fiscal as compared with for fiscal the following tables present analyses of credit services average balance sheets and interest rates in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal and changes in net interest income during those fiscal years average balance sheet analysis

provision for consumer loan losses 
the provision for consumer loan losses is the amount necessary to establish the allowance for consumer loan losses at a level that the company believes is adequate to absorb estimated losses in its consumer loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
the company s provision for consumer loan losses was  million and  million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the company s allowance for consumer loan losses was million at november  and million at november  the allowance for consumer loan losses is a significant estimate that represents management s estimate of probable losses inherent in the consumer loan portfolio 
the allowance for consumer loan losses is an allowance logo 
table of contents applicable to the owned homogeneous consumer credit card loan portfolio that is evaluated quarterly for adequacy and is established through a charge to the provision for consumer loan losses 
in calculating the allowance for consumer loan losses  the company uses a systematic and consistently applied approach 
the amount of the allowance is established through a process that begins with estimates of the losses inherent in the consumer loan portfolio based on coverage of a rolling average of historical credit losses 
in addition  the company regularly performs a migration analysis a technique used to estimate the likelihood that a consumer loan will progress through the various stages of delinquency and ultimately charge off of delinquent and current consumer credit card accounts in order to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for consumer loan losses 
the migration analysis considers uncollectible principal  interest and fees reflected in consumer loans 
in evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for consumer loan losses  management also considers factors that may impact future credit loss experience  including current economic conditions  recent trends in delinquencies and bankruptcy filings  account seasoning  loan volume and amounts  payment rates and forecasting uncertainties 
a provision for consumer loan losses is charged against earnings to maintain the allowance for consumer loan losses at an appropriate level 
the provision for consumer loan losses  which is affected by net charge offs  loan volume and changes in the amount of consumer loans estimated to be uncollectible  increased and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increases in both periods were due to higher net charge off rates 
in fiscal  the increase was partially offset by lower levels of average general purpose credit card loans 
in addition  to reflect the impact of the continued difficult economic environment on its credit card portfolio and an adverse trend in bankruptcy filings  the company recorded a provision for consumer loan loss expense that exceeded the amount of net consumer loans charged off by approximately million in fiscal and approximately million in fiscal general purpose credit card loans are considered delinquent when interest or principal payments become days past due 
general purpose credit card loans are charged off at the end of the month during which an account becomes days past due  except in the case of bankruptcies and fraudulent transactions  where loans are charged off earlier 
loan delinquencies and charge offs are primarily affected by changes in economic conditions and may vary throughout the year due to seasonal consumer spending and payment behaviors 
in both fiscal and fiscal  net charge offs increased in both the owned and managed portfolios as compared with the prior year periods 
despite the increase in net charge off rates  the company s delinquency rates in both the over and over day categories were lower at november  as compared with november   reflecting the company s increased focus on collections in the earlier stages of delinquency 
weak economic conditions and a higher level of bankruptcy filings in the us  coupled with the seasoning of the company s general purpose credit card loan portfolio  contributed to the higher net charge off rates during fiscal if weak economic conditions and a higher level of bankruptcy filings continue to persist  the rate of net charge offs may be higher in future periods 
the company s future charge off rates and credit quality are subject to uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from what has been discussed above 
factors that influence the provision for consumer loan losses include the level and direction of general purpose credit card loan delinquencies and charge offs  changes in consumer spending and payment behaviors  bankruptcy trends  the seasoning of the company s general purpose credit card loan portfolio  interest rate movements and their impact on consumer behavior  and logo

fiscal s total non interest expenses decreased  primarily due to lower marketing and business development expense  partially offset by increases in professional services and compensation and benefits expense 
compensation and benefits expense increased in fiscal  principally reflecting an increase in salaries and benefits 
excluding compensation and benefits expense  non interest expenses decreased 
marketing and business development expenses decreased in fiscal due to lower marketing and advertising expense as the company shifted its focus from account growth to credit quality 
professional services expense increased  attributable to higher consulting expenses and increased costs associated with enhanced credit and collection strategies 
fiscal s total non interest expenses increased  primarily due to higher compensation and benefits and information processing and communications expenses  partially offset by lower marketing and business development expenses 
increased business activity related to the discover platinum card also contributed to the increase in non interest expenses in fiscal compensation and benefits expense increased in fiscal  primarily due to higher costs associated with increased employment levels resulting from higher transaction volume and collection activities 
excluding compensation and benefits expense  non interest expenses increased 
information processing and communications expense increased due to higher volume related external data processing costs as well as higher depreciation costs associated with equipment at transaction processing facilities 
marketing and business development expenses decreased in fiscal due to lower marketing and advertising expense  including domestic and international direct mailing costs 
other expenses increased  primarily reflecting increases in certain operating expenses due to higher levels of transaction volume  business activity and a higher level of allocated costs  partially offset by a decline in inquiry fees resulting from fewer new account applications 
seasonal factors 
the credit card lending activities of credit services are affected by seasonal patterns of retail purchasing 
historically  a substantial percentage of general purpose credit card loan growth occurs in the fourth calendar quarter  followed by a flattening or decline of these loans in the following calendar quarter 
merchant fees  therefore  historically have tended to increase in the first fiscal quarter  reflecting higher sales activity in the month of december 
additionally  higher cardmember rewards incentives historically have been accrued for as a reduction of merchant and cardmember fee revenues in the first fiscal quarter  reflecting seasonal growth in retail sales volume

table of contents liquidity and capital resources 
liquidity and capital policies 
the company s senior management establishes the overall liquidity and capital policies of the company  reviews the company s performance relative to these policies  monitors the availability of sources of financing  and oversees the liquidity and interest rate sensitivity of the company s asset and liability position 
liquidity management policies 
the primary goal of the company s funding and liquidity activities is to ensure adequate financing over a wide range of potential credit ratings and market environments 
the following liquidity framework is designed to ensure that the company maintains sufficient liquidity to meet all of its obligations for a one year period without issuing any new unsecured debt liquidity framework designed to cash capital policy ensure that the company can fund its balance sheet while repaying its debt obligations maturing within one year without issuing new unsecured debt 
the company attempts to achieve this by maintaining sufficient long term debt and equity capital to finance its securities inventory and all illiquid assets 
liquidity reserve cover volatility in funding needs  which may not be covered in the short term by cash capital long term debt and equity capital 
the reserve is periodically assessed and determined based on funding volatility and capacity 
excess cash liquidity averaged approximately billion during fiscal in the form of immediately available cash and cash equivalents 
contingency planning establish and maintain a contingency funding plan to stress test the company s ability to manage a prolonged liquidity contraction and provide a course of action over a one year time period to ensure orderly functioning of the company s businesses 
the company pursues a strategy of diversification of funding sources by products and markets and attempts to ensure that the tenor of the company s liabilities equals or exceeds the expected holding period of the assets being financed 
maturities of financings are designed to manage exposure to refinancing risk in any one period 
the company maintains a surplus of unused short term funding sources at all times to withstand any unforeseen contraction in credit capacity 
the company emphasizes the use of collateralized financing to limit reliance on credit sensitive unsecured borrowings 
in addition  the company attempts to maintain cash and unhypothecated marketable securities equal to at least of its outstanding short term unsecured borrowings 
the company also maintains committed credit facilities to support its ongoing borrowing programs 
capital policies 
the company s senior management views equity capital as an important source of financial strength and  therefore  pursues a strategy of ensuring that the company s equity base adequately reflects the economic risk inherent in its businesses 
capital is required for  among other things  the company s securities inventories  underwritings  principal investments  private equity activities  consumer loans  bridge loans and other financings  and investments in fixed assets  including aircraft assets 
the company also considers return on common equity to be an important measure of its performance  in the context of both the particular business environment in which the company is operating and its peer group s results 
in this regard  the company actively manages its consolidated capital position based upon  among other things  business opportunities  capital availability and rates of return together with internal capital policies  regulatory requirements and rating agency guidelines and  therefore  in the future may expand or contract its capital base to address the changing needs of its businesses 
the company attempts to maintain total equity  on a consolidated basis  at least equal to the sum of its operating subsidiaries equity 
currently  the company believes it has sufficient capital to meet its needs 
the company returns internally generated equity capital that is in excess of the needs of its businesses to its shareholders through common stock repurchases and dividends 
the board of directors has authorized the logo 
table of contents company to purchase  subject to market conditions and certain other factors  shares of common stock for capital management purposes 
the unused portion of this authorization at january  was approximately million 
the company also has an ongoing repurchase authorization in connection with awards granted under its equity based compensation plans 
the board of directors determines the declaration and payment of dividends on a quarterly basis 
the balance sheet 
the company s total assets increased to billion at november  from billion at november   primarily attributable to increases in financial instruments owned  including corporate and other debt  us government and agency securities and other sovereign government obligations  securities purchased under agreements to resell and securities borrowed 
a substantial portion of the company s total assets consists of highly liquid marketable securities and short term receivables arising principally from securities transactions 
the highly liquid nature of these assets provides the company with flexibility in financing and managing its business 
balance sheet leverage ratios are one indicator of capital adequacy when viewed in the context of a company s overall liquidity and capital policies 
the company views the adjusted leverage ratio as a more relevant measure of financial risk when comparing financial services firms and evaluating leverage trends 
this ratio is adjusted to reflect the low risk nature of assets attributable to matched resale agreements  certain securities borrowed transactions and segregated customer cash balances 
in addition  the adjusted leverage ratio reflects the deduction from shareholders equity of the amount of equity used to support goodwill  as the company does not view this amount of equity as available to support its risk capital needs 
the following table sets forth the company s total assets  adjusted assets  leverage ratios and book value per share at november  dollars in millions  except ratio and per share data total assets adjusted assets leverage ratio x x adjusted leverage ratio x x book value per share adjusted assets represent total assets less the sum of i assets that were recorded under certain provisions of sfas no 
 ii the lesser of securities purchased under agreements to resell or securities sold under agreements to repurchase  iii the lesser of securities borrowed or securities loaned  iv segregated customer cash balances and v goodwill 
leverage ratio equals total assets divided by tangible shareholders equity  million at november  and  million at november  
for purposes of this calculation  tangible shareholders equity includes preferred and common equity and preferred securities subject to mandatory redemption  less goodwill 
adjusted leverage ratio equals adjusted assets divided by tangible shareholders equity 
book value per share equals common shareholders equity divided by common shares outstanding of  million at november  and  million at november  principal sources of funding 
the company funds its balance sheet on a global basis through diverse sources 
these sources include the company s equity capital  long term debt  repurchase agreements  us  canadian  euro  japanese and australian commercial paper  asset backed securitizations  letters of credit  unsecured bond borrowings  securities lending  buy sell agreements  municipal reinvestments  master notes  and committed and uncommitted lines of credit 
repurchase agreement transactions  securities lending and a portion of the company s bank borrowings are made on a collateralized basis and  therefore  provide a more stable source of funding than short term unsecured borrowings 
logo 
table of contents the company s bank subsidiaries solicit deposits from consumers  purchase federal funds and issue short term bank notes 
interest bearing deposits are classified by type as savings  brokered and other time deposits 
savings deposits consist primarily of money market deposit accounts sold nationally and savings deposits from individual securities clients 
brokered deposits consist primarily of certificates of deposits issued by the company s bank subsidiaries 
other time deposits include individual and institutional certificates of deposits 
unsecured debt and borrowings 
the company views long term debt as a stable source of funding for core inventories  consumer loans and illiquid assets 
in general  securities inventories and the majority of current assets are financed with a combination of short term funding  floating rate long term debt or fixed rate long term debt swapped to a floating rate  and fixed assets are financed with fixed rate long term debt 
both fixed rate and floating rate long term debt in addition to sources of funds accessed directly by the company s credit services business are used to finance the company s consumer loan portfolio 
consumer loan financing is targeted to match the repricing and duration characteristics of the loans financed 
the company uses derivative products primarily interest rate  currency and equity swaps to assist in asset and liability management  reduce borrowing costs and hedge interest rate risk see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the volume of the company s borrowings generally fluctuates in response to changes in the amount of repurchase transactions outstanding  the level of the company s securities inventories and consumer loan receivables  and overall market conditions 
availability and cost of financing to the company can vary depending on market conditions  the volume of certain trading and lending activities  the company s credit ratings and the overall availability of credit 
the company maintains borrowing relationships with a broad range of banks  financial institutions  counterparties and others from which it draws funds in a variety of currencies 
the company values committed credit as a significant component of its liquidity policy

the banks are committed to provide up to an aggregate of billion 
off balance sheet funding 
the asset securitization market is a significant source of funding for the company s credit services business 
by utilizing this market  the company further diversifies its funding sources  realizes cost effective funding and reduces reliance on the company s other funding sources  including unsecured debt 
the securitization transaction structures utilized for the credit services business are accounted for as sales ie  off balance sheet transactions in accordance with ie generally accepted accounting principles see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
in connection with its discover card securitization program  the company transfers credit card receivables  on a revolving basis  to the discover card master trust i the trust  which issues asset backed securities that are registered with the sec or privately placed 
this structure includes certain features designed to protect the investors that could result in earlier than expected amortization of the transactions  potentially resulting in the need for the company to obtain alternative funding arrangements 
the primary feature relates to the availability and adequacy of cash flows in the securitized pool of receivables to meet contractual requirements economic early amortization 
economic early amortization risk reflects the possibility of negative net securitization cash flows which would occur if the coupon  contractual servicing fee and net charge offs exceeded the collections of finance charges and cardmember fees on securitized credit card receivables and is driven primarily by the trust s credit card receivables performance in particular  receivables yield  cardmember fees and credit losses incurred as well as the contractual rate of return of the asset backed securities 
in the event of an economic early amortization  receivables that otherwise would have been subsequently purchased by the trust from the company would instead continue to be recognized on the company s consolidated statements of financial condition since the cash flows generated in the trust would instead be used to repay investors in the asset backed securities 
these recognized receivables would require the company to obtain alternative funding 
although the company believes that the combination of factors that would result in an economic early amortization event is remote  the company also believes its access to alternative funding sources would mitigate this potential liquidity risk 
the company maintains a committed credit facility with a group of banks to support the short term extendible asset backed certificate program issued by the trust the newcastle facility 
under the terms of the newcastle facility  the banks are committed to provide up to billion 
credit ratings 
the company s reliance on external sources to finance a significant portion of its day to day operations makes access to global sources of financing important 
the cost and availability of unsecured financing generally are dependent on the company s short term and long term credit ratings 
factors that are significant to the determination of the company s credit ratings or otherwise affect the ability of the company to raise short term and long term financing include its level and volatility of earnings  relative positions in the markets in which it operates  global and product diversification  risk management policies  cash liquidity and capital structure 
in addition  the agencies that rate the company s debt have focused on certain recent changes in the market that may require financial services firms to assume more credit risk in connection with their corporate lending activities and recent legal and regulatory developments 
a deterioration in any of the previously mentioned logo 
table of contents factors or combination of these factors may lead rating agencies to downgrade the credit ratings of the company  thereby increasing the cost to the company in obtaining unsecured financings 
in addition  the company s debt ratings can have a significant impact on certain trading revenues  particularly in those businesses where longer term counterparty performance is critical  such as over the counter derivative transactions  including credit derivatives and interest rate swaps 
in connection with certain over the counter trading agreements associated with the institutional securities business  the company would be required to provide additional collateral to certain counterparties in the event of a downgrade by either standard poor s or moody s investors service 
at november   the amount of additional collateral that would be required in the event of a one notch downgrade of the company s senior debt credit rating was approximately million

high yield instruments 
in connection with the company s fixed income securities activities  the company underwrites  trades  invests and makes markets in non investment grade instruments high yield instruments 
for purposes of this discussion  high yield instruments are defined as fixed income  emerging market  preferred equity securities and distressed debt rated bb or lower or equivalent ratings by recognized credit rating agencies as well as non rated securities which  in the opinion of the company  contain credit risks associated with non investment grade instruments 
for purposes of this discussion  positions associated with the company s credit derivatives business are not included because reporting gross market value exposures would not accurately reflect the risks associated with these positions due to the manner in which they are risk managed 
high yield instruments generally involve greater risk than investment grade securities due to the lower credit ratings of the issuers  which typically have relatively high levels of indebtedness and  therefore  are more sensitive to adverse economic conditions 
in addition  the market for high yield instruments is  and may continue to be  characterized by periods of volatility and illiquidity 
the company monitors total inventory positions and risk concentrations for high yield instruments in a manner consistent with the company s market risk management policies and control structure 
the company manages its aggregate and single issuer net exposure through the use of derivatives and other financial instruments

effects of inflation and changes in foreign exchange rates 
because the company s assets to a large extent are liquid in nature  they are not significantly affected by inflation 
however  inflation may result in increases in the company s expenses  which may not be readily recoverable in the price of services offered 
to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects upon the securities markets  upon the value of financial instruments and upon the markets for consumer credit services  it may adversely affect the company s financial position and profitability 
a significant portion of the company s business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar  and changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar can therefore affect the value of us dollar net assets  revenues and expenses 
potential exposures as a result of these fluctuations in currencies are closely monitored and  where cost justified  strategies are adopted that are designed to reduce the impact of these fluctuations on the company s financial performance 
these strategies may include the financing of non us dollar assets with direct or swap based borrowings in the same currency and the use of currency forward contracts or the spot market in various hedging transactions related to net assets  revenues  expenses or cash flows

table of contents derivative financial instruments 
the company actively offers to counterparties and trades for its own account a variety of financial instruments described as derivative products or derivatives 
these products generally take the form of futures  forwards  options  swaps including credit default swaps  caps  collars  floors  swap options and similar instruments that derive their value from underlying interest rates  foreign exchange rates  commodities  equity instruments  equity indices  reference credits or other assets 
the company s trading divisions use derivative products as an integral part of their respective trading strategies  and such products are used extensively to manage the market exposure that results from a variety of proprietary trading activities see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  as a dealer in certain derivative products  most notably interest rate and currency swaps  the company enters into derivative contracts to meet a variety of risk management and other financial needs of its counterparties 
given the highly integrated nature of derivative products and related cash instruments in the determination of overall trading division profitability and the context in which the company manages its trading areas  it is not meaningful to allocate trading revenues between the derivative and underlying cash instrument components 
moreover  the risks associated with the company s derivative activities  including market and credit risks  are managed on an integrated basis with associated cash instruments in a manner consistent with the company s overall risk management policies and control structure see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management in part ii  item a 
it should be noted that while particular risks may be associated with the use of derivatives  in many cases derivatives serve to reduce  rather than increase  the company s exposure to market  credit and other risks 
with respect to its derivatives positions including both listed and otc  the company s exposure to market risk relates to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  or the fair value of the underlying financial instruments or commodities 
the company s exposure to credit risk at any point in time is represented by the fair value of such contracts reported as assets 
such total fair value outstanding as of november  was billion 
approximately billion of that credit risk exposure was with counterparties rated single a or better 
the company also uses derivative products primarily interest rate  currency and equity swaps to assist in asset and liability management  reduce borrowing costs and hedge interest rate risk see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that derivatives are valuable tools that can provide cost effective solutions to complex financial problems and remains committed to providing its counterparties with innovative financial products 
the company established morgan stanley derivative products inc to offer derivative products to counterparties that will enter into derivative transactions only with triple a rated counterparties 
in addition  the company  through its continuing involvement with regulatory  self regulatory and industry activities  provides leadership in the development of policies and practices in order to maintain confidence in the markets for derivative products  which is critical to the company s ability to assist counterparties in meeting their overall financial needs

fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties variable interest entities 
variable interest entities vies are required to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if they do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved 
the primary beneficiary of a vie is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of its expected residual returns  or both  as a result of holding variable interests 
fin also requires new disclosures about vies 
on february   the company adopted fin for vies created after january  and for vies in which the company obtains an interest after january  the company will adopt fin on september  for vies in which it holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  the company is currently evaluating the impact of the provisions of fin on its consolidated financial statements 
the company is involved with various entities in the normal course of business that may be deemed to be vies and may hold interests therein  including interest only strip investments and derivative instruments  that may be considered variable interests 
transactions associated with these entities include asset and mortgage backed securitizations and structured financings including collateralized debt  bond or loan obligations and credit linked notes 
the company principally engages in these transactions to facilitate client needs and as a means of selling financial assets 
the company currently consolidates entities in which it has a controlling financial interest in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us for those entities deemed to be qualifying special purpose entities as defined in sfas no 
 which includes the credit card asset securitization master trust see note to the consolidated financial statements  the company does not consolidate the entity 
the company believes that it is reasonably possible that it will either disclose information in its form k for fiscal about certain vies created before february  for which it holds a significant variable interest or it will be the primary beneficiary of the entity and thus be required to consolidate the vie on september  at november   in connection with its institutional securities business  the aggregate size of the entities for which the company s interest is either significant or for which the company could be deemed to be the primary beneficiary of the entity was approximately billion 
the company s variable interests associated with these entities  primarily financial asset backed securitization and collateralized debt and bond obligation entities  was approximately million  which represents the company s maximum exposure to loss at november  in connection with its investment management business  where the company is the asset manager for collateralized bond and loan obligation entities  the aggregate size of potential vies at november  was approximately billion 
the company s variable interests associated with its investment management activities was approximately million  which represents the company s maximum exposure to loss at november the company purchases and sells interests in entities that may be deemed to be vies in its market making capacity in the ordinary course of its institutional securities business 
as a result of these activities  it is reasonably possible that such entities may be consolidated and deconsolidated at various points in time 
therefore  the company s variable interests included above may not be held by the company at its fiscal year end

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management 
risk management policy and control structure 
risk is an inherent part of the company s business and activities 
the extent to which the company properly and effectively identifies  assesses  monitors and manages each of the various types of risk involved in its activities is critical to its soundness and profitability 
the company s broad based portfolio of business activities helps reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its net revenues as a whole 
the company seeks to identify  assess  monitor and manage  in accordance with defined policies and procedures  the following principal risks involved in the company s business activities market risk  credit risk  operational risk  legal risk and funding risk 
funding risk is discussed in the liquidity and capital resources section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the company s currency exposure relating to its net monetary investments in non us dollar functional currency subsidiaries is discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
risk management at the company is a multi faceted process with independent oversight that requires constant communication  judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets 
the company s senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification  assessment and control of various risks 
in recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the global financial services business  the company s risk management policies  procedures and methodologies are evolutionary in nature and are subject to ongoing review and modification 
the management committee  composed of the company s most senior officers  establishes the company s overall risk management policies and reviews its performance relative to these policies 
the management committee has authorized the securities risk committee to assist in monitoring and reviewing the company s market risk management practices 
the securities risk committee has created sub committees that report on specific risk management issues 
these risk committees  as well as other committees established to manage and monitor specific risks  review the risk monitoring and risk management policies and procedures relating to the company s market and credit risk profile  sales practices  pricing of consumer loans and reserve adequacy  legal enforceability  and operational and systems risks 
the market risk  credit  controllers  treasury  and law and compliance departments collectively  the control groups  which are all independent of the company s business units  assist senior management and the risk committees in monitoring and controlling the company s risk profile 
the market risk and credit departments have operational responsibility for measuring and monitoring aggregate market and credit risk  respectively  with respect to the company s institutional trading activities and are responsible for risk policy development  risk analysis and risk reporting to senior management and the risk committees 
in addition  the internal audit department  which reports to senior management and the company s audit committee  periodically examines and evaluates the company s operations and control environment 
the company is committed to employing qualified personnel with appropriate expertise in each of its various administrative and business areas to implement effectively the company s risk management and monitoring systems and processes 
the following is a discussion of the company s risk management policies and procedures for its principal risks other than funding risk 
the discussion focuses on the company s securities trading primarily its institutional trading activities and consumer lending and related activities 
the company believes that these activities generate a substantial portion of its principal risks 
this discussion and the estimated amounts of the company s market risk exposure generated by the company s statistical analyses are forward looking statements 
however  the analyses used to assess such risks are not predictions of future events  and actual results may vary significantly from such analyses due to events in the markets in which the company operates and certain other factors described below

table of contents market risk 
market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or more market prices  rates  indices  implied volatilities the price volatility of the underlying instrument imputed from option prices  correlations or other market factors  such as liquidity  will result in losses for a position or portfolio 
sound risk management is an integral part of the company s culture 
the various business units and trading desks are responsible for ensuring that market risk exposures are well managed and prudent 
the control groups help ensure that these risks are measured and closely monitored and are made transparent to senior management 
a variety of limits are designed to control price and liquidity risk 
market risk is monitored through various measures statistically using value at risk var and related analytical measures  by measures of position sensitivity  and through routine stress testing conducted by the market risk department in collaboration with the business units 
the material risks identified by these processes are summarized in reports produced by the market risk department that are circulated to  and discussed with  senior management 
sales and trading and related activities 
primary market risk exposures and market risk management 
during fiscal  the company had exposures to a wide range of interest rates  equity prices  foreign exchange rates and commodity prices and associated implied volatilities and spreads related to the global markets in which it conducts its trading activities 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk as a result of its market making activities and proprietary trading in interest rate sensitive financial instruments eg  risk arising from changes in the level or implied volatility of interest rates  the timing of mortgage prepayments  the shape of the yield curve and credit spreads 
the company is exposed to equity price and implied volatility risk as a result of making markets in equity securities and derivatives and maintaining proprietary positions 
the company is exposed to foreign exchange rate and implied volatility risk as a result of making markets in foreign currencies and foreign currency options and from maintaining foreign exchange positions 
the company is exposed to commodity price and implied volatility risk as a result of trading in physical commodities such as crude and refined oil products  natural gas  electricity  and precious and base metals and related derivatives 
the company manages its trading positions by employing a variety of risk mitigation strategies 
these strategies include diversification of risk exposures and hedging through the purchase or sale of positions in related securities and financial instruments  including a variety of derivative products eg  futures  forwards  swaps and options 
the company manages the market risk associated with its trading activities on a company wide basis  on a worldwide trading division level and on an individual product basis 
the company manages and monitors its market risk exposures in such a way as to maintain a portfolio that the company believes is well diversified in the aggregate with respect to market risk factors and reflects the company s aggregate risk tolerance as established by the company s senior management 
aggregate market risk limits have been approved for the company and for its major trading divisions worldwide equity and fixed income  which includes interest rate products  credit products  foreign exchange and commodities 
additional market risk limits are assigned to trading desks and  as appropriate  products and regions 
trading division risk managers  desk risk managers  traders and the market risk department monitor market risk measures against limits in accordance with policies set by senior management 
the market risk department independently reviews the company s trading portfolios on a regular basis from a market risk perspective utilizing var and other quantitative and qualitative risk measures and analyses 
the company s trading businesses and the market risk department also use  as appropriate  measures such as sensitivity to changes in interest rates  prices  implied volatilities and time decay to monitor and report market risk exposures 
stress testing  which measures the impact on the value of existing portfolios of specified changes in market factors for certain products  is performed periodically and is reviewed by trading division risk managers  desk risk managers and the market risk department 
reports summarizing material risk exposures are produced by the market risk department and are disseminated to senior management 
logo 
table of contents value at risk var 
the company uses the statistical technique known as var as one of the tools used to measure  monitor and review the market risk exposures of its trading portfolios 
the market risk department calculates and distributes daily var based risk measures to various levels of management 
var methodology  assumptions and limitations 
the company estimates var using a model based on historical simulation for major market risk factors and monte carlo simulation for name specific risk in certain equity and fixed income exposures 
historical simulation involves constructing a distribution of hypothetical daily changes in the value of trading portfolios based on two sets of inputs historical observation of daily changes in key market indices or other market factors market risk factors  and information on the sensitivity of the portfolio values to these market risk factor changes 
the company s var model uses approximately four years of historical data to characterize potential changes in market risk factors 
the company s one day var corresponds to the negative change in portfolio value that  based on historically observed market risk factor movements  would have been exceeded with a frequency of  or once in every trading days if the portfolio was held constant for one day 
the company s var model generally takes into account linear and non linear exposures to price risk and linear exposures to implied volatility risks 
market risks that are incorporated in the var model include equity and commodity prices  interest rates  foreign exchange rates and associated implied volatilities 
as a supplement to the use of historical simulation for major market risk factors  the company s var model uses monte carlo simulation to capture name specific risk in equities and credit products ie corporate bonds and credit derivatives 
var models such as the company s evolve over time in response to changes in the composition of trading portfolios and to improvements in modeling techniques and systems capabilities 
for example  during fiscal  as part of the company s ongoing program of var model enhancement  position and risk coverage were broadened and risk measurement methodologies were refined for certain commodity energy  crude oil and crude oil products and fixed income products credit products 
among their benefits  var models permit estimation of a portfolio s aggregate market risk exposure  incorporating a range of varied market risks  reflect risk reduction due to portfolio diversification or hedging activities  and can cover a wide range of portfolio assets 
however  var risk measures should be interpreted carefully in light of the methodology s limitations  which include the following past changes in market risk factors may not always yield accurate predictions of the distributions and correlations of future market movements  changes in portfolio value in response to market movements especially for complex derivative portfolios may differ from the responses calculated by a var model  var using a one day time horizon does not fully capture the market risk of positions that cannot be liquidated or hedged within one day  the historical market risk factor data used for var estimation may provide only limited insight into losses that could be incurred under market conditions that are unusual relative to the historical period used in estimating the var  and published var results reflect past trading positions while future risk depends on future positions 
the company is aware of these and other limitations and  therefore  uses var as only one component in its risk management oversight process 
as explained above  this process also incorporates stress testing and scenario analysis and extensive risk monitoring  analysis  and control at the trading desk  division and company levels 
var for fiscal the table below presents the company s var for each of the company s primary market risk exposures and on an aggregate basis at november  and november   incorporating substantially all financial instruments generating market risk that are managed by the company s institutional trading businesses 
this measure of var incorporates most of the company s trading related market risks 
however  a small proportion of trading positions generating market risk was not covered  and the modeling of the risk characteristics of some positions involved approximations that could be significant under certain circumstances 
for example  risks associated with residential mortgage backed securities have been approximated as it is difficult to capture precisely these risks within a var context 
logo 
table of contents aggregate var also incorporates a the funding liabilities related to institutional trading positions and b public company equity positions recorded as principal investments by the company 
the incremental impact on var of these non trading positions was not material as of november  and november   and  therefore  the table below does not separately report trading and non trading vars 
principal investments made by the company that are not publicly traded are not reflected in the var results reported below 
as of november   the aggregate carrying value of such investments was approximately million 
since var statistics reported below are estimates based on historical position and market data  var should not be viewed as predictive of the company s future financial performance or its ability to monitor and manage risk 
there can be no assurance that the company s actual losses on a particular day will not exceed the var amounts indicated below or that such losses will not occur more than once in trading days 
the table below presents var for each of the company s primary risk exposures and on an aggregate basis at november  and november  one day var at november  primary market risk category dollars in millions  pre tax interest rate equity price foreign exchange rate commodity price subtotal less diversification benefit aggregate var diversification benefit equals the difference between aggregate var and the sum of the vars for the four risk categories 
this benefit arises because the simulated one day losses for each of the four primary market risk categories occur on different days  similar diversification benefits also are taken into account within each such category 
the company s aggregate var at november  increased from the prior year  as an increase in interest rate var was partially offset by a decrease in equity price var 
the increase in interest rate var is primarily related to ongoing improvements in var methodology that more precisely capture price risk from credit products  such as credit derivatives and securitized products 
the table below represents var on a one day time horizon which may be used to facilitate comparisons with other global financial services firms that report var at a confidence interval one day var at november  primary market risk category dollars in millions  pre tax interest rate equity price foreign exchange rate commodity price subtotal less diversification benefit aggregate var logo 
table of contents in order to facilitate comparisons with other global financial services firms that report var with respect to a business day holding period  the company s one day aggregate var for a two week time horizon at november  was million at a confidence interval and million at a confidence interval 
the tables below present the high  low and average and one day aggregate trading var over the course of fiscal for substantially all of the company s institutional trading activities 
certain market risks included in the year end aggregate var discussed above are excluded from this measure eg  equity price risk in public company equity positions recorded as principal investments by the company and certain funding liabilities related to trading positions daily one day var for fiscal high low average primary market risk category dollars in millions  pre tax interest rate equity price foreign exchange rate commodity price aggregate trading var daily one day var for fiscal high low average primary market risk category dollars in millions  pre tax interest rate equity price foreign exchange rate commodity price aggregate trading var as shown in the table above  the company s average one day aggregate trading var for fiscal was million 
around this average  the company s aggregate trading var varied from day to day 
the histogram below presents the distribution of the company s daily one day aggregate trading var for its institutional trading activities and shows that for more than of fiscal trading days  aggregate trading var ranged between million and million 
the days where aggregate trading var exceeded million occurred during the second quarter of fiscal and were primarily the result of a concentrated single name equity exposure that was reduced prior to that quarter s end 
logo 
table of contents logo one method of evaluating the reasonableness of the company s var model as a measure of the company s potential volatility of net revenues is to compare the var with trading revenues 
for a one day var  the expected number of times that trading losses should exceed var during the fiscal year is three  and  in general  if trading losses were to exceed var more than five times in a year  the accuracy of the var model could be questioned 
the company evaluates the reasonableness of its var model by comparing the potential declines in portfolio values generated by the model with actual trading results 
the histogram below shows the distribution of daily net revenues during fiscal for the company s institutional trading businesses including net interest  commissions and primary revenue credited to the institutional trading businesses 
there were no days during fiscal in which the company incurred daily trading losses even when excluding primary revenues in its institutional trading business in excess of the one day aggregate trading var 
additionally  there were no trading days in fiscal where the largest one day loss exceeded the minimum one day aggregate trading var as reported in the high low average table 
this suggests that var  as currently implemented  has been a conservative measure of the potential net revenue variability in the company s daily trading activities 
logo 
table of contents logo consumer lending and related activities 
interest rate risk and management 
in its consumer lending activities  the company is exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates 
such changes in interest rates impact interest earning assets  principally credit card and other consumer loans and net excess servicing fees received in connection with consumer loans sold through asset securitizations  as well as the interest sensitive liabilities that finance these assets  including asset backed securitizations  long term borrowings  deposits  federal funds  and short term bank notes 
the company s interest rate risk management policies are designed to reduce the potential volatility of earnings that may arise from changes in interest rates by having a financing portfolio that reflects the existing repricing schedules of consumer loans as well as the company s right  with notice to cardmembers  to reprice certain fixed rate consumer loans to a new interest rate in the future 
to the extent that asset and related financing repricing characteristics of a particular portfolio are not matched effectively  the company utilizes interest rate derivative contracts  such as swap agreements  to achieve its objectives 
interest rate swap agreements effectively convert the underlying asset or financing from fixed to variable repricing or from variable to fixed repricing 
sensitivity analysis methodology  assumptions and limitations 
for its consumer lending activities  the company uses a variety of techniques to assess its interest rate risk exposure  one of which is interest rate sensitivity simulation 
for purposes of presenting the possible earnings effect of a hypothetical  adverse change in interest rates over the month period from its fiscal year end  the company assumes that all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities will be impacted by a hypothetical  immediate basis point increase in interest rates as of the beginning of the period 
interest rate sensitive assets are assumed to be those for which the stated interest rate is not contractually fixed for the next month period 
a portion of the company s credit card receivables have a fixed interest rate  although the company has the right  with notice to cardmembers  to subsequently reprice these receivables to a new interest rate 
therefore  the company considers the receivables with a fixed interest rate to be interest rate sensitive 
the company measured the earnings sensitivity for these assets from the expected repricing date  which takes into consideration the required notice period and billing cycles 
in addition  assets that have a logo 
table of contents market based index  such as the prime rate  which will reset before the end of the month period  or assets with rates that are fixed at fiscal year end but which will mature  or otherwise contractually reset to a market based indexed or other fixed rate prior to the end of the month period  are rate sensitive 
the latter category includes certain credit card loans that may be offered at below market rates for an introductory period  such as for balance transfers and special promotional programs  after which the loans will contractually reprice in accordance with the company s normal market based pricing structure 
for purposes of measuring rate sensitivity for such loans  only the effect of the hypothetical basis point change in the underlying market based indexed or other fixed rate has been considered rather than the full change in the rate to which the loan would contractually reprice 
for assets that have a fixed interest rate at fiscal year end but which contractually will  or are assumed to  reset to a market based indexed or other fixed rate during the next months  earnings sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing date 
in addition  for all interest rate sensitive assets  earnings sensitivity is calculated net of expected loan losses 
interest rate sensitive liabilities are assumed to be those for which the stated interest rate is not contractually fixed for the next month period 
thus  liabilities that have a market based index  such as the prime  commercial paper or libor rates  which will reset before the end of the month period  or liabilities whose rates are fixed at fiscal year end but which will mature and are assumed to be replaced with a market based indexed rate prior to the end of the month period  are rate sensitive 
for these fixed rate liabilities  earnings sensitivity is measured from the expected repricing date 
assuming a hypothetical  immediate basis point increase in the interest rates affecting all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities as of november   it is estimated that the pre tax income of consumer lending and related activities over the following month period would be reduced by approximately million 
the comparable reduction of pre tax income for the month period following november  was estimated to be approximately million 
the reduction in pre tax income at november  was lower as compared with the prior year  primarily due to the impact of the assumed replacement interest rates of certain maturing fixed rate financing  reflecting the lower interest rate environment 
the hypothetical model assumes that the balances of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities at fiscal year end will remain constant over the next month period 
it does not assume any growth  strategic change in business focus  change in asset pricing philosophy or change in asset liability funding mix 
thus  this model represents a static analysis that cannot adequately portray how the company would respond to significant changes in market conditions 
furthermore  the analysis does not necessarily reflect the company s expectations regarding the movement of interest rates in the near term  including the likelihood of an immediate basis point change in market interest rates  nor necessarily the actual effect on earnings if such rate changes were to occur 
credit risk 
institutional securities activities 
credit risk is the risk of loss to the company arising from possible borrower or counterparty default on a contractual financial commitment 
credit risk arising in connection with the company s institutional securities activities is managed by the credit department and various business lines  within parameters set by the company s senior management 
credit risk management takes place at transaction  obligor and portfolio levels 
at the transaction level  the company seeks to mitigate credit risk through management of key risk elements such as size  tenor  seniority and collateral
