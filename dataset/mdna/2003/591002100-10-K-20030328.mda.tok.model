however  certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and may require the application of significant judgment by our management  as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
in applying those policies  our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
those estimates are based on our historical experience  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
our significant accounting policies include revenue recognition revenues from our advisory services are recognized on a straight line basis over the subscription contract period  generally one year 
all subscription contracts are billable at signing  absent special terms granted on a limited basis from time to time 
as such  our policy is to record at the time of signing of an advisory services subscription contract the fees receivable and related deferred revenues for the full amount of the subscription contract 
accounts receivable and deferred revenues that extend beyond a month period have been classified on the consolidated balance sheets as non current 
we also record the related sales commission obligation upon the signing of the subscription contract and amortize the corresponding deferred commission expense over the subscription period in which the related advisory services revenues are earned and amortized to income 
the company recognizes revenue on strategic consulting engagements as the work is performed and the services are rendered utilizing the percentage of completion method or based on time and materials on a contract by contract basis 
revenues from published research products are recognized at the time the applicable product is delivered 
additionally  we record reductions to revenue for estimated customer cancellations 
accounts receivable allowance during the years ended december   and  we recorded total provisions for uncollectable accounts receivable of million  million and million  respectively  based upon management s estimates as to the collectability of its accounts receivable 
we generally evaluate our accounts receivable on a monthly basis 
as part of our analysis  we examine our collections history  the age of the receivables in question  any specific customer collection issues that we have identified  and general market conditions 
at december  and  our total accounts receivable balances were million and million  respectively 
we may need to record additional expenses in the future if our collections or the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate 
investment recoverability during the years ended december   and  we recorded impairment charges of million  million and million  respectively  relating to our investments in and advances to companies in parallel or synergistic industries 
we follow a practice to review our individual investments for impairment on a quarterly basis 
this review includes the examination of the estimated market value of each specific investment using peer group market comparables of public companies 
additionally  we review the business climate of each investee  its historical financial results  its projected cash flow  its plans for the future and the likelihood of achieving such plans 
based on such review  a determination is made on a case by case basis as to whether an investment is deemed to be permanently impaired and therefore requires an adjustment to the carrying value 
we will continue to evaluate our investments for impairment every quarter  and based on our review  may record additional impairment losses should the facts and circumstances in existence at that time merit such an adjustment 
deferred tax asset recoverability during the year ended december   we recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets as a result of our losses over the recent history 
we considered future taxable income versus the cumulative losses incurred during the previous three years and determined that  in light of the cumulative losses over our recent history  we could not support a conclusion that realization of the existing deferred tax assets was more likely than not 
likewise  should we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment will be made to the balance of the valuation allowance

 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas

sfas also requires that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets be tested for impairment at least annually 
with respect to our intangible assets with finite lives  during the quarter ended march   we assessed the remaining useful lives of such assets and deemed them to be appropriate 
with respect to our goodwill recorded as of january   we completed the implementation of fas as of september  based on the completion of the test  it was determined that the goodwill associated with our strategic consulting and published research products segments was impaired as of january  accordingly  we recorded a goodwill charge of million relating to the carrying value of the goodwill of these segments as of january  the impairment charge was recorded as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and recorded retroactive to january  additionally  as of september  we completed the annual impairment test for in accordance with the provisions with sfas as a result of this test  it was determined that the goodwill associated with the strategic consulting and published research products segments was impaired

risk factors the following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the information in this form k and the documents incorporated by referenced into this form k 
these risk factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition or otherwise cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements 
net losses experienced by the company the company experienced a net loss before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  to return to profitability  the company will need to  among other things  achieve revenue growth and or maintain operating expenses below revenue levels 
the company cannot be certain whether  or when  either will occur 
if the company fails to either achieve sufficient revenue growth or maintain operating expenses below revenue levels  such failure will result in continued operating losses that would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
potential harm to the company caused by continued decreases in and delays of it spending the company s business depends on continued spending on it by substantial commercial and governmental users of it 
if  as a result of general economic uncertainty or other factors  it users continue to decrease it spending levels or delay their purchases of it products and services as was experienced by the company starting in the latter half of the year ended december  and continuing through the year ended december   then such decreases or delays could continue to reduce demand for the company s products and services  substantially harm the company s business and have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
risk of product pricing limiting potential market the company s pricing strategy may limit the potential market for the company s advisory services  strategic consulting services and published research products to substantial commercial and governmental users and vendors of it 
as a result  the company may be required to reduce prices for its advisory services  strategic consulting services and published research products or to introduce new products and services with lower prices to expand or maintain its market share 
these actions could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company s dependence on renewals of subscription based services the company derived approximately and of its total revenues during the years ended december  and  respectively  from subscriptions to its advisory services 
advisory service subscriptions typically have a one year term  and the company may not be successful in maintaining its subscription renewal rates 
the company s ability to renew subscriptions is subject to a number of risks  including the following the company may be unsuccessful in delivering consistent  high quality  and timely analysis and advice to its clients the company may not be able to hire and retain highly talented professionals in a very competitive job market the company may be unsuccessful in understanding and anticipating market trends and the changing needs of its clients the company may not be able to deliver products and services of the quality and timeliness necessary to withstand competition the company s clients may continue to shift their demand to more consultative  solution oriented products and services that take into account the client s unique environment 
if the company is unable to successfully maintain its subscription renewal rates  such an inability could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company s dependence on non recurring strategic consulting engagements the company derived approximately and of its total revenues during the years ended december  and from strategic consulting engagements 
strategic consulting engagements vary in number  size  and scope  and typically are project based and non recurring 
the company s ability to replace completed strategic consulting engagements with new engagements is subject to a number of risks  including the following the company may be unsuccessful in delivering consistent  high quality  and timely consulting services to its clients the company may not be able to hire or retain highly talented consultants in a very competitive job market the company may not be able to develop new business the company may not be able to maintain the costs of strategic consulting engagements within fixed fee arrangements the company may be unsuccessful in understanding and anticipating market trends and the changing needs of its clients the skills and competencies of the company s strategic consulting staff may not match the skills required for the fulfillment of existing or potential strategic consulting engagements the company may not be able to deliver consulting services of the quality and timeliness necessary to withstand competition if the company is not able to replace completed strategic consulting engagements with new engagements  such an inability could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company s expectation of fluctuations in operating results the company s operating results have varied significantly from quarter to quarter 
the company expects future operating results to fluctuate due to several factors  many of which are not in the company s control the disproportionately large percentage of the company s advisory services subscriptions that expire in the fourth quarter of each year the level and timing of renewals of subscriptions to the company s advisory services the mix of advisory services revenues versus strategic consulting and published research products revenues the number  size  and scope of the company s strategic consulting engagements  the degree of completion of such engagements and the ability of the company to match the skills of its consulting staff to consulting engagement opportunities accuracy of estimates of resources required to complete ongoing strategic consulting engagements the timing and amount of new business generated by the company the mix of domestic versus international business the performance of the company s acquired international subsidiaries the timing of the development  introduction  marketing and market acceptance of new products and services the timing of the hiring of research analysts  consultants  and sales representatives effective use of the company s analysts and consultants changes in the spending patterns of the company s clients the company s ability to collect its accounts and notes receivable changes in market demand for it research and analysis the company s ability to increase its sales to its existing customers and find new customers decreases in spending on it by substantial commercial and governmental users of it general economic uncertainty and economic slowdown in the us and abroad competitive conditions in the industry  including pricing pressure due to these factors  the company believes period to period comparisons of operating results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied on as an indication of future operating results 
the potential fluctuations in the company s operating results make it likely that  in some future quarter  the company s operating results will be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  which could have a material adverse effect on the price of the company s common stock 
risks associated with international operations net revenues attributable to international clients represented approximately of the company s total advisory services revenues for the years ended december  and the company sells its products internationally through a network of foreign subsidiaries and independent sales representative organizations 
the company assumes significantly greater risk by selling through independent sales representative organizations than through a direct employee sales force or through its foreign subsidiaries 
risks associated with the company s international operations include failure by the company to find distributors for its products and services the financial health of each foreign subsidiary and independent sales representative organization the ability of each independent sales representative organization to repay its liabilities to the company developing and maintaining relationships with independent sales representative organizations and their employees failure by the company to replace sales representative agreements on terms beneficial to the company or on a timely basis and clients potential unwillingness to continue to do business with the company or its new distributor in the event that any existing agreements with independent sales representative organizations are terminated integration of acquired foreign subsidiaries into the company s existing operations greater difficulty in maintaining direct client contact greater accounts receivable collection risk to the extent the company relies on the sales representative organization to invoice and collect receivables longer accounts receivable collection cycles political  social  and economic conditions in various jurisdictions  including legal policies  measures and regulatory requirements affecting commerce 
these effects could  in turn  increase the costs of the company s products and services or cause some international clients to reduce their purchases of our products and services 
in addition  effective intellectual property protection may not be available in all jurisdictions in which we offer or intend to offer our products and services 
tariffs and other trade barriers potentially adverse tax consequences the company expects that international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of its revenues and intends to continue to expand its international operations 
expansion into new geographic territories may require considerable management and financial resources  as was the case during the three years ended december   and may negatively impact the company s results of operations 
if the company is unable to successfully manage the risks associated with international operations  such an inability could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations  and financial condition 
risks of failing to anticipate changing market needs the company s success depends in part on its ability to anticipate rapidly changing technologies and market trends and to adapt its products and services to meet the changing information and analysis needs of it users 
frequent and dramatic changes characterize the it industry  including the following introduction of new products and obsolescence of others shifting strategies and market positions of major industry participants paradigm shifts with respect to system architectures changing objectives and expectations of it users and vendors volatility in spending levels on it by substantial commercial and governmental users of it this environment of rapid and continuous change presents significant challenges to the company s ability to provide its clients with current and timely analysis and advice on issues of importance to them 
the company commits substantial resources to meeting these challenges 
if the company fails to provide insightful timely analysis of developments and assessment of technologies and trends in a manner that meets changing market needs  such a failure could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company s dependence on its ability to attract and retain qualified personnel the company needs to hire  train  and retain qualified employees to execute its strategy and support growth 
in particular  the company needs trained research analysts  consultants  sales representatives  product development staff  operations staff and management 
the company continues to experience intense competition in recruiting and retaining qualified employees 
the pool of experienced candidates is small  and the company competes for qualified employees against many companies  including gartner  inc that have substantially greater financial resources than the company 
if the company is unable to successfully hire  retain  and motivate a sufficient number of qualified employees  such an inability will have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
competition the it research  analysis  and consulting industry is extremely competitive 
the company competes directly with other independent providers of similar services and indirectly with the internal staffs of current and prospective client organizations 
the company s principal direct competitor  gartner  inc  has a substantially longer operating history and has considerably greater financial resources and market share than the company 
the company also competes indirectly with larger electronic and print media companies and consulting firms 
these indirect competitors  many of which have substantially greater financial  information gathering  and marketing resources than the company  could choose to compete directly against the company in the future 
the company s market has few barriers to entry 
new competitors could easily compete against the company in one or more market segments addressed by the company s advisory services or strategic consulting services 
the company s existing and future competitors may develop products and services that are more effective than the company s products and services 
competitors may also produce their products and services at less cost and market them more effectively 
if the company is unable to successfully compete against existing or new competitors  such an inability will have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and would likely result in pricing pressure and loss of market share 
risks associated with new product and services development the company s future success depends on its ability to develop or acquire new products and services that address specific industry and business sectors  changes in client requirements and technological changes in the it industry 
the process of internally researching  developing  launching  and gaining client acceptance of a new product or service is inherently risky and costly 
assimilating and marketing an acquired product or service is also risky and costly 
in addition  the company has introduced few new products or services and has had limited experience in acquiring and integrating new products or services into its business 
if the company is unable to develop or acquire new products and services  such an inability will have a material adverse effect on its business  operating results and financial condition 
risks associated with strategic investments in an effort to develop new products and services  from april to december  the company made investments in and advances to companies in parallel or synergistic industries totaling approximately million 
such strategic investments and advances are highly risky and illiquid 
during the years ended december   and  the company made the determination that based on reviews of the business climate of each company in which it has an investment  its historical financial results  its projected cash flow  its plans for the future and the likelihood of achieving such plans and other available market data  several of its investments in affiliate companies were impaired 
accordingly  the company recorded a million  million and million impairment loss  respectively  on the carrying value of these investments 
there can be no assurance that such strategic investments will result in new product or service offerings for the company or otherwise be successful 
many factors outside the control of the company  including general economic conditions  could impair the value of the company s strategic investments requiring the company to record further  substantial losses related to such investments 
moreover  these strategic investments may disrupt the ongoing business of the company and distract management 
furthermore  there can be no assurances that the company will be able to liquidate its strategic investments when needed or desirable 
if the company is unable to manage its remaining strategic investments  such inabilities could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
risk of failure to integrate recent acquisitions and risks associated with potential acquisitions as part of its business strategy  the company buys  or makes investments in  complementary businesses  products  and services 
if the company finds a business it wishes to acquire  the company could have difficulty negotiating the terms of the purchase  financing the purchase  and assimilating the employees  products  and operations of the acquired business 
the acquisitions may disrupt the ongoing business of the company and distract management 
furthermore  acquisitions of new businesses may not lead to the successful development of new products or services  or if developed  such products may not achieve market acceptance or prove to be profitable 
the company may therefore pay more than the value the company derives from the acquisition 
a given acquisition may also have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  the company may be required to incur debt or issue equity to pay for any future acquisitions or contingent payments in connection with previously consummated acquisitions  which may be dilutive to the company s current stockholders and or decrease its working capital 
the volatility and unpredictability of the company s stock price the market price of the company s common stock has been volatile 
during  as reported on the nasdaq national market  the company s common stock quotations ranged from a high of to a low of 
in  the market price of the company s common stock reached a low of and a high of 
in  the market price of the company s common stock reached a low of and a high of 
the market price of the company s common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to the company s perceived prospects  including anticipated revenue growth variations in the company s operating results and the company s achievement of key business targets the company s ability to maintain operating expenses below revenue levels changes in securities analysts recommendations or earnings estimates differences between the company s reported results and those expected by investors and securities analysts announcements of new service offerings by the company or its competitors market reaction to any acquisitions  joint ventures or strategic investments announced by the company or its competitors general economic or stock market conditions unrelated to the company s operating performance in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of their securities  many companies have been the subject of securities class action litigation 
if the company were sued in a securities class action  it would result in substantial costs  as well as a diversion of management s attention and resources  and it would likely cause the market price of the company s common stock to fall 
risks associated with political and social turmoil increasing political and social turmoil  such as military actions and terrorist activities  can be expected to put further pressure on economic conditions in the united states and foreign jurisdictions and are placing pressure on the company s business operations 
for example  certain company events in various geographies  such as the middle east  have been postponed in light of potential ongoing military action in the region 
additionally  as a result of military action and terrorist activities  the company has issued to its employees cautionary advice with respect to employee travel 
these conditions make it difficult for the company and its customers to accurately forecast and plan future business activities and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in  the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates related primarily to borrowings under its prior million credit facility  which consisted of a million revolving credit line and an million term loan 
at december   there was million in borrowings outstanding under this facility 
under the facility  interest was computed on outstanding borrowings at the rate of libor plus or the higher of a the prime rate or b the federal funds rate plus 
in january  the company repaid all amounts outstanding under its credit facility 
in march  the company executed a new million amended and restated credit agreement with its bank the amended facility 
the amended facility replaces the existing facility and consists of a million revolving credit facility 
under the amended facility  interest on any outstanding borrowings will be payable at the rate of libor plus or the higher of a the prime rate or b the federal funds rate plus 
the company believes that an increase or a decrease of ten percent in the effective interest rate on available borrowings on its facility  if fully utilized  would not have a material effect on future results of operations 
the company is exposed to market risk as it relates to changes in the market value of its strategic investments 
the company made investments in and advances to companies in parallel or synergistic industries to that of the company s 
during the years ended december   and  the company recorded million  million and million  respectively  in impairment losses on its investments and advances 
as of december   the company had investments and advances totaling million 
these investments and advances are inherently risky because the companies we invested in are private companies that are typically in the early development stages 
adverse changes in market conditions  like those experienced during the latter half of the year ended december  through december   and poor operating results of the underlying investments may result in the company incurring additional losses or an inability to recover the remaining value of its investments and advances 
the company is exposed to market risk as it relates to foreign currency exchange rates 
revenues and expenses in foreign currencies translate into higher or lower revenues and expenses in us dollars as the us dollar weakens or strengthens against foreign currencies 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates may therefore negatively affect the company s consolidated revenues and expenses 
currency transaction gains or losses arising from transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of the company s foreign subsidiaries are included in the results of operations 
such gains and losses were not material to the company s consolidated results of operations during the years ended december  and the company believes that an increase or a decrease of ten percent in foreign currency exchange rates would not have a material effect on future results of operations 
the company has not entered into foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
