critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
areas where significant judgments are made include  but are not limited to  the critical accounting policies discussed below 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
the company s senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of the accounting estimates in the critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
the most significant principles that impact the company and its subsidiaries relate to post retirement benefits and pension obligations  reclamation costs and reserve estimates  depletion of mineral rights and development costs included in property  plant and equipment and deferred income taxes 
the following discussion highlights those impacts 
the most significant long term obligations of the company are post retirement medical and life insurance benefits and pneumoconiosis black lung benefits 
the majority of these benefits are provided through self funded programs 
the company describes these obligations for retired workers as heritage health benefit costs and the estimated amount of future payments for such obligations are determined actuarially and are included in the corporate segment 
the estimated cost to provide post retirement medical and life insurance benefits to employees at active mining operations are included in the coal segment 
the discount rate used to calculate the present value of these future benefits was reduced from in to in and will be adjusted annually based upon interest rate fluctuations 
the discount rate used can vary from company to company 
in addition  the estimated amount of future claims is affected by the assumed health care cost trend rate 
during  the company increased the initial cost trend rate assumption to from decreasing to an ultimate trend of in and beyond 
these factors  among others  greatly affect the annual expense which totaled million in compared to million in and the accrued liability of million at december  for post retirement medical and life insurance costs 
the excess of trust assets over the pneumoconiosis benefit obligation increased to million as of december  from million as of december  as a result of increased bond values due to lower interest rates and despite an increase to the actuarially determined obligation 
the company s share of reclamation costs  along with other costs related to mine closure  are accrued and charged against income in the coal business segment on a units of production basis over the life of each mine  except at wri where the company s obligation is limited and monitoring costs are being expensed over a year period 
future costs of reclamation are estimated based upon the standards for mine reclamation that have been established by various regulatory agencies that regulate the company s mining operations 
estimated costs can change and the liability included in the financial statements of million as of december  must be viewed as an estimate which is subject to revision 
the remaining coal reserves used to calculate annual reclamation expense are also engineering estimates and are subject to change 
in the coal business segment the company amortizes its mineral acquisition  development costs and some plant and equipment using the units of production method based upon estimated recoverable proven and probable reserves 
these estimates are reviewed on a regular basis and are adjusted to reflect current mining plans 
as a result  changes in estimates of recoverable proven and probable reserves could change amounts recorded in the future for depletion of development costs 
the company accounts for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability method 
one of the largest potential assets of the company is the federal net operating loss carryforwards or nols which were approximately million as of december  the company s ability to utilize these nols  which are available to the company to reduce future income taxes until the nols expire at various dates through  is dependent upon many factors which determine taxable income 
these factors include the timing of tax deductions for certain obligations  such as post retirement medical benefits and reclamation  percentage depletion of coal production  and any potential limitation on using losses due to a change of ownership in the company 
the company estimates future utilization of the tax losses and its impact on the recognition of deferred tax assets each period 
in connection with the acquisitions  the company recognized a million deferred income tax asset to recognize that portion of the previously unrecognized net operating loss carryforwards that would be utilized through the generation of future taxable income 
a valuation allowance of  was concurrently created to cover those nols not yet assumed to be utilized 
any increases or decreases to the estimated future utilization of the nols will impact the valuation allowance and affect deferred income tax expense 
an increase in the estimated utilization of nols will decrease deferred income tax expense  a decrease in the estimated utilization of nols will increase deferred income tax expense 
these changes can materially affect net earnings resulting in an effective book income tax rate different than the federal statutory rate 
for example  the agreement to sell dta in is expected to result in a gain and eliminate future operating losses from those operations 
both benefits of the sale significantly increased the expected utilization of nols and reduced the valuation allowance which  in turn  increased the tax benefit and net earnings recognized for the year ended december  the valuation allowance was  as of december  and increased overall to  as of december  after the benefit of dta and changes in other deferred tax assets and liabilities 
this allowance includes the loss carryforwards accumulating in north dakota that are not expected to be utilized 
therefore  the valuation allowance is increased by the amount of north dakota nols resulting in no net impact to deferred tax assets or income tax expense 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table presents contractual obligations or estimates and commitments of the company as of december   which are discussed elsewhere in this filing 
payments due by period in thousands of dollars contractual obligations and commitments total after wml revolving debt   wml term debt       wcc revolving debt other debt   operating leases   heritage health benefit pension undiscounted obligations workers compensation       umwa pension       discounted obligations combined benefit fund multiemployer       post retirement medical       qualified pension benefits   serp benefits   pneumoconiosis       reclamation costs       preferred dividends      per year the umwa pension obligation is being contested by the company as discussed below in liquidity outlook 
the present value of the estimated obligation is not accrued as a liability since it is a multiemployer plan 
premium payments are expensed when due

gross estimated cost of final reclamation is shown in table 
the accrued liability of  as of december  will increase as acres are disturbed in mining operations and as mine closures draw nearer 
the accrued liability does not reflect contractual obligations of customers and a contract miner to perform reclamation currently estimated at  an escrowed investments totaling  as of december  from contributions by customers for reclamation of weco s rosebud mine 
represents quarterly dividends which are accumulated but unpaid through and including january  as provided in the certificate of designation establishing the series a preferred stock  the holders of the series a preferred stock are entitled to receive dividends when  as and if declared by the board of directors out of funds of the corporation legally available therefore 
in general  dividends that are not paid cumulate  as provided in the certificate of designation 
significant coal contract issues westmoreland acquired several existing coal supply agreements when it purchased the coal businesses of montana power 
weco supplies coal to the four colstrip units under two distinct contracts 
the contract for units and called for the price to be reopened on the contract s thirtieth anniversary  which was july  and gave the parties six months to negotiate a new delivered price for coal 
if the parties are unable to agree on a new price  the issue is submitted to binding arbitration 
weco and the owners of units and have been negotiating since july in an attempt to reach an agreement for the price of coal through contract expiration in the deadline provided in the contract for arbitration was extended through june in connection with the ongoing efforts to agree on a new price 
after more than a year had passed  weco sent the units and owners an arbitration demand on september  proceedings are anticipated to take place during the summer of while weco believes it is due a price increase  as with any arbitration  the outcome is uncertain 
on august   nwr  as part of a settlement of then pending litigation  entered into an amended lignite supply agreement with reliant now cnp  for its limestone electric generating station 
cnp has notified nwr that it has assigned the alsa to tgn  a subsidiary 
the alsa provided for a transition from the cost plus fees pricing mechanism of the original lignite supply agreement to a market based pricing mechanism under the alsa effective july  the market based pricing mechanism is an annual determination of the equivalent cost of purchasing  delivering  and consuming powder river basin prb coal from wyoming at legs  subject to a minimum and a maximum price set forth under the alsa 
the alsa provides that the price be redetermined annually and that annual volumes be committed eighteen months prior to the start of each calendar year s shipments 
if tgn proposes to purchase prb coal above the amount committed to  nwr has the right of first refusal to meet the equivalent prb price and supply lignite instead 
in no event may tgn procure prb coal for legs  either in addition to or in place of the committed volumes  unless nwr declines to match the equivalent price of prb coal and deliver lignite 
in accordance with the alsa  the parties agreed in june to lignite volumes for the period july through december the alsa also called for the prb equivalent price for july through december and the annual commitment volume to have been determined by the end of june however  tgn asserted that certain cost effects associated with the uprating of at least one of its two legs generating units and with its strategy to comply with new texas nitrogen oxide nox emission regulations which take effect may  should be included in the calculation of the prb equivalent price 
when the parties were unable to agree on the pricing mechanism  nwr filed for a declaratory judgment in limestone county  texas  against tgn then reliant in december nwr claimed that the uprating and nox compliance costs should not be included in or otherwise affect the calculation of the prb equivalent price 
nwr also claimed that it is necessary to resolve nwr and tgn s competing claims before the prb equivalent price could be calculated 
subsequently  nwr and tgn then reliant agreed to stay this litigation and resolved these issues for and by entering into an interim agreement on june  that set firm pricing and volumes from july  through december   provided tgn flexibility to test blends of sprb coal for nox compliance in  obligated tgn to make best efforts to achieve a lignite to sprb blend that achieves nox compliance using a minimum of million tons per year of lignite  obligated tgn to share its test results and allowed nwr to observe the tests  postponed the commitment of lignite volumes for until early in  stayed all related litigation until february  the parties have since extended this date to march   and required the parties to make good faith efforts to select a standing arbitrator as required under the alsa 
refer to item legal proceedings for further information 
in the course of testing blends of prb coal for nox compliance during the second half of  tgn failed to take delivery of the full lignite volumes agreed upon in the june  letter agreement 
nwr has subsequently informed tgn that it expects to be compensated as provided under the june  interim agreement for shortfall volumes 
tgn claims nwr was unable to deliver these amounts 
in addition  tgn has procured certain amounts of prb coal above the agreed upon volume of  tons without first offering a right of first refusal to nwr 
nwr has informed tgn that it would be entitled to damages for this breach 
nwr has asserted that it is not in breach until it uses any such coal 
finally  tgn believes and has requested that nwr should pay royalties on lignite produced since july  from nwr mineral leases with tgn 
nwr disputes its obligation to pay these royalties 
nwr and tgn have been meeting in an attempt to settle all of the issues above and to agree upon prices and volumes for and or longer 
as with any dispute  the outcome is uncertain  however  the company believes that the ultimate resolution of this dispute will not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
in addition to the contract issues discussed above  the company is involved with various other legal proceedings  described in item legal proceedings  which may affect the company s liquidity 
other risks westmoreland s businesses use large equipment  including mining and power generation equipment and conveyor systems used for the transportation of coal 
while every effort is made to maintain this equipment  there is always a risk that unexpected equipment breakdowns can interrupt either the production of coal or generation of electricity 
for example  in the fall of the dragline at the beulah mine was damaged and was out of operation for six weeks while being repaired at a cost of approximately  not covered by insurance 
unexpected equipment failure at electric generating units  called forced outages  if significant  may adversely impact westmoreland 
these forced outages could cause fluctuations in delivery of coal or in distributions from westmoreland s independent power plants 
for example  the colstrip unit was shut down several times in for unexpected repairs which significantly reduced coal sales from the rosebud mine 
westmoreland s business is subject to some seasonality 
weather has the potential to impact westmoreland s business 
the company supplies coal to electric generation units and if winter is unseasonably warm or summer is unseasonably cool  the customer s need for coal may be less than expected 
the mild winter of decreased the demand for electrical generation and lowered the company s coal sales during early wgi is contractually obligated to perform mining and reclamation at the absaloka mine 
wgi emerged from bankruptcy in and reached agreement with wri regarding several claims as discussed elsewhere in this report 
if wgi is unable to perform its mining contract or complete its reclamation obligation  wri would be prepared to operate the mine and supply coal to its customers  and would have a claim against wgi 
changes in various mining  coal fired generating plant and other environmental regulations have the potential to impact the company 
these include president bush s clean skies initiative and global climate initiative  the kyoto protocols  and the texas noxregulations 
the company is dependent on a limited number of contracts and customers 
the company derives substantially all of its revenues from a relatively small number of coal supply contracts and from two independent power projects 
the company may have difficulty managing existing and future growth 
the company rapidly and significantly expanded its operations during  and will pursue further opportunities to expand and diversify its revenue base 
these expansions may place a significant strain on the company s management  operations  and financial resources and may require additions to the company s current personnel  systems  procedures  and controls 
the loss of key senior management personnel could negatively affect the company s business 
the company depends on the continued services and performance of senior management and other key personnel  particularly christopher k 
seglem  chairman of the board  president and chief executive officer 
the company does not have key person life insurance policies 
the unexpected loss of any of the company s executive officers or other key employees could harm its business 
liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operating activities was  in   in and  in cash from operations in compared to benefited from an additional four months of operations from the acquisitions completed in the second quarter of which contributed  and  to operating cash flow during the years ended december  and  respectively 
cash provided by operating activities in also included  from the company s three virginia independent power projects which were sold on march  other components of cash flow from operating activities  such as impairment charges  deferred income tax benefit  depreciation  depletion and amortization are discussed in the results of operations 
the net change in assets and liabilities was  in compared to  in the most significant components are accounts receivable and accounts payable 
accounts receivable and accounts payable can vary widely at the end of any reporting period 
the company has a few large customers and therefore the timing of receipt of accounts receivables can have a significant effect on cash from operations 
likewise  the company has large payments of accounts payable due to a few vendors or suppliers 
the actual timing of these payments can have a significant impact on cash from operations from period to period 
accounts receivable contributed cash of  in due to better collection of outstanding amounts owed by customers 
the large increase in accounts payable in is due to normal activity at the acquired mines and contributed  to cash flow 
also  cash from operations benefited in by approximately million from a favorable judgment in the ft 
drum dispute with the us army 
cash flows in were positively impacted by the settlement of the rova forced outage litigation 
working capital was a deficit of  at december  compared to a positive  as of december  primarily due to the timing of collection of accounts receivable and increased reclamation activities expected during cash used in investing activities was  in   in and  in in  additions to property and equipment using cash totaled  and proceeds of  from sales of used equipment provided cash 
also  during  wml deposited  into required restricted cash accounts for debt service and security deposits and earned interest income of approximately  the  refund of collateral under the umwa master agreement which was received during the second quarter of provided cash and reduced restricted cash 
the primary use of cash in was  paid for acquisitions and payments of  into restricted cash accounts for debt service 
cash used in investing activities also included the recoupment of collateral required for long term security deposits and bond obligations of  in associated with a change in bonding agents 
in addition to the acquisitions  additions to the company s property  plant and equipment totaled  in and consisted principally of mine development costs at weco 
cash provided by investing activities in included  in proceeds from the sale of the company s interests in the three virginia independent power projects 
cash used in investing activities in included funding of collateral for security deposits of  and fixed asset additions of  including  at wri offset by a partial reimbursement from wri s mine operator of  cash used in financing activities was  for cash used in financing activities in represented repayment of wml s long term bank debt of  the net repayment of revolving debt of  repayment of  of other term debt  repurchases of preferred shares totaling  and dividends paid to wri s minority shareholder of  cash in the amount of  was provided by the exercise of stock options in as of december   the company s revolving line of credit has million outstanding of the million total available under the facility 
cash provided by financing activities for totaled  cash provided in represented proceeds from the issuance of long term and revolving debt  net of  debt issuance costs  and cash of  from the exercise of stock options less  for repayment of long term debt and  of dividends paid to wri s minority shareholder 
cash used in financing activities in totaled  and was primarily for repayment of wri s long term debt as well as the payments of dividends to minority shareholders of wri 
consolidated cash and cash equivalents at december  totaled  including  at wml and  at wri 
at december   cash and cash equivalents totaled  including  at wml and  at wri 
the cash at wml is available to the company through quarterly distributions as described below in the liquidity outlook section 
the cash at wri  an owned subsidiary  is available to the company through dividends 
in addition  the company had restricted cash and bond collateral  which were not classified as cash or cash equivalents  of  at december  and  at december  the restricted cash at december  included  in the wml debt service reserve accounts described above 
the company s workers compensation and post retirement medical cost obligation bonds were collateralized by interest bearing cash deposits of  which amount was classified as a non current asset 
in addition  the company has reclamation deposits of  which were funded by certain customers to be used for payment of reclamation activities at the rosebud mine 
the company also has  in interest bearing debt reserve accounts for certain of the company s independent power projects 
this cash is restricted as to its use and is classified as part of the investment in independent power projects 
the restricted cash at december  included  in the wml debt service accounts and  deposited to collateralize the company s obligations required by the master agreement dated as of january  the master agreement among wcc  wri  wellc  westmoreland terminal company  and westmoreland coal sales company  the umwa benefit plan and its trustees  the umwa combined benefit fund and its trustees  the umwa pension trust and its trustees  the umwa  and the official committee of equity security holders  which facilitated the dismissal of wcc s bankruptcy case 
in  the company s workers compensation bond was collateralized by interest bearing cash deposits of  in addition  the company s reclamation deposits totaled  the company also had  in interest bearing debt reserve accounts for certain of the company s independent power projects 
liquidity outlook the major factors impacting the company s liquidity outlook are its significant heritage health benefit costs  its acquisition debt repayment obligations  and its ongoing business requirements 
the company s principal sources of cash flow are dividends from wri  distributions from independent power projects and distributions from wml subject to its debt agreement provisions 
the demand for electricity will affect coal demand and pricing and therefore will impact the company s production and cash flow 
a detailed discussion of health benefit and retirement obligations is provided below 
the company s heritage health benefit costs consist primarily of payments for post retirement medical and workers compensation benefits 
the company also is obligated for employee pension and pneumoconiosis benefits 
the pension plans have a deficit in funding as of the end of and the pneumoconiosis obligation has a funding surplus at present 
it is important to note that retiree health benefit costs are affected by nationwide increases in medical service and prescription drug costs 
as a result of the acquisitions completed in  the company assumed additional obligations  as of april   for post retirement medical and life insurance benefits of approximately  which will negatively impact the estimated annual expenditures for benefits 
due to the impact of increasing healthcare cost trends on the actuarial valuations of future obligations the company s total estimated liability has increased and the heritage health benefit expense for may continue to increase 
the estimated liability for post retirement medical costs increased approximately million between december  and december  due to an increase in the actuarially determined expense recognized 
actuarial valuations of the company s future obligations indicate that the company s retiree health benefit costs will continue to increase in the near term and then decline to zero over the next approximately thirty five years as the number of eligible beneficiaries declines 
the company incurred cash costs of  for heritage health benefit costs in and expects to incur  for these costs in the company incurred cash costs of approximately  for workers compensation benefits in  the company expects to incur cash costs of less than  for workers compensation benefits in and expects that amount to steadily decline to zero over the next approximately eighteen years 
there were no workers compensation obligations assumed in conjunction with the acquisitions as all the acquired operations are fully insured for any potential obligation 
one element of heritage health benefit costs is umwa pensions under the retirement plan 
since this plan is a multiemployer plan under erisa  a contributing company is liable for its share of unfunded vested liabilities upon termination or withdrawal from the plan 
the company believes the plan was fully funded in when the company terminated its last umwa employees who were participants in the retirement plan and withdrew from the plan 
however  the plan claims that the company withdrew on a date earlier than the date on which the company terminated its last umwa employee and that when the company withdrew the plan was not fully funded 
the plan has asserted a claim of  which the company is vigorously contesting through arbitration as provided under erisa 
the company recognized the  asserted liability in the arbitration proceeding began june  and evidence regarding determination of the appropriate withdrawal date has been submitted 
the company is awaiting the arbitrator s decision on the withdrawal date issue 
determination of the amount of withdrawal liability  if any  was deferred until the withdrawal date was determined 
if necessary  a second arbitration proceeding to determine the amount of withdrawal liability will be held 
in accordance with the multiemployer pension plan amendments act of  the company has made monthly principal and interest payments to the plan while it pursues its rights and will continue to make such monthly payments until arbitration is completed 
included in the payments made in is interest of approximately  and principal of  at the conclusion of arbitration the company may be entitled to a refund or it could be required to pay any remaining obligation in installments through under the coal industry retiree health benefit act of coal act  the company is required to provide postretirement medical benefits for umwa miners by making premium payments into three benefit plans i the umwa combined benefit fund the combined fund  a multiemployer plan which benefits miners who retired before january  or who retired thereafter but whose last employer did not provide benefits pursuant to an operator specific individual employer plan iep  ii an iep for miners who retired after january   and iii the umwa benefit plan  a multiemployer plan which benefits a miners who were eligible to retire on february   who did retire on or before september  and whose former employers are no longer in business  b miners receiving benefits under an iep whose former employer goes out of business and ceases to maintain the iep  and c new spouses or new dependents of retirees in the combined fund who would be eligible for coverage thereunder but for the fact that the combined fund was closed to new beneficiaries as of july  the premiums paid by the company cover its own retirees and its allocated portion of the pool of retired miners whose previous employers have gone out of business 
the coal act also authorized the trustees of the umwa benefit plan to implement security provisions for the payment of future benefits 
the trustees set the level of security for each company at an amount equal to three years benefits 
the bond amount and the amount to be secured are reviewed and adjusted on an annual basis 
the company secured its obligation in by posting a bond for million 
the bond was collateralized by us government backed securities in the amount of  at march  which amount the company withdrew during the second quarter of in connection with a change of bonding agents 
the company s previous bonding agent required collateral equal to approximately of the bonded amount 
the company s bond amount increased to approximately million in early but was then reduced to approximately million during the second quarter of by the trustees of the umwa plan 
the company s bonding agent required cash collateral of  to support the increased bond amount  which amount was deposited in june the amount of the bond collateral is periodically reviewed by the bonding agent and may be increased back to prior levels of approximately of the bonded amount 
the company has been notified that additional collateral of  may be required in early the combined fund faces an ongoing solvency crisis because benefit expenses continue to exceed premiums from contributing companies 
the combined fund sought additional funding relief from congress in under the sponsorship of senators byrd and rockefeller of west virginia  the house and senate approved  as a part of the interior and related agencies appropriations bill  a transfer of accumulated interest in the abandoned mine land reclamation fund aml to the combined fund 
in its report  the conference committee noted that this was a short term solution and urged that the congressional committees with jurisdiction over the matter work with the concerned parties to insure the long term solvency of the combined fund 
the conference committee went on to admonish the parties not to ask for additional funding from aml in the future 
this funding was in addition to the annual transfer from the aml funds and does not prevent the combined fund from continuing to operate at a deficit 
in september  congressmen rahall of west virginia introduced a bill hr to further modify the allocation of interest that accrues to the aml and permit additional use of the accrued interest by the combined fund 
hr would remove the million cap on annual transfers of interest balances from the aml to the combined fund and remove the requirement that transferred funds must be used to provide benefits for the unassigned beneficiaries 
hr allows interest transfers to be made to offset the amount of any deficits to the combined fund or to prevent reductions in health care coverage 
the congressional budget office cbo estimates that the combined fund will record a deficit of net assets in and each year thereafter 
it is estimated that the combined fund will run a deficit of more than million over the period 
without some relief like hr  the combined fund estimates that it will have to reduce benefits starting in and will need to cut million in benefits over the period with the current million cap 
hr passed the house but not the senate before adjournment in and is expected to be reintroduced in the th session of congress 
in connection with its dismissal from chapter in  the company agreed to secure its obligations under the master agreement for a period of six years by providing a contingent promissory note note 
the original principal amount of the note was million 
the company collateralized its obligations under the note in part by posting million for the first three years in an escrow account 
the note is payable only in the event the company does not meet its coal act obligations  fails to meet certain ongoing financial tests specified in the note  or failed to maintain a required balance of million in an escrow account through the company met all of these requirements through and  accordingly  in january  the principal amount of the note was reduced to million and the million collateral was returned to the company on may  the remaining note amount of million is secured by the rova cash flows to the company which must be maintained at a minimum of million per year 
a medicare prescription drug benefit that covers medicare eligible beneficiaries covered by the coal act could reduce one of the company s largest costs 
of the over million per year the company paid for retirees health care costs in  more than is for prescription drugs 
provision of such a benefit continues to be debated on the national level  and although both republicans and democrats proposed new bills in  none of the bills passed both houses of congress 
it is expected that both parties will introduce legislation intended to address prescription drugs in the th congress 
there is no assurance at this time what  if any  new proposal will be enacted into law or what effect that it may have on the company s obligation 
the company expects that there will be continued upward pressure on corporate insurance and surety bonding rates as a result of insurers world wide loss experiences over the past several years  the terrorist attacks in september and ongoing threats around the world 
property and casualty premiums are increasing by extraordinary amounts and some companies face limitations on the amount of coverage and bonding capacity available to them 
westmoreland was able to maintain all required insurance coverage and capacity as of july  but at higher premiums 
at the beginning of the third quarter  the company formed an offshore based captive insurance company to help mitigate the effect of escalating premiums 
the captive insurance company elected to be a us tax paying entity 
the company s acquisitions in greatly increased revenues and operating cash flow  and have returned the company to profitability  but the cash used and financing arranged to make those acquisitions could also create short term liquidity issues which must be managed 
the company used million of available cash in the second quarter of to complete the acquisitions  knowing that short term liquidity would be temporarily reduced by doing so 
the terms of the acquisition financing facility also restricted distributions to the company from wml  particularly through march  while the required debt service reserve account was being initially funded 
distributions available from wml increased in the second quarter of when a one time reduction in the debt service reserve account of approximately million was realized after the million term a notes were fully repaid at june  however  the debt financing requires that of excess cash flow  as defined  be used to fund the balloon payment due in therefore  only of wml s excess cash flow is available to the company until the debt is paid off 
the final purchase price for the acquisition of montana power s coal business is subject to adjustment 
as discussed in item legal proceedings of this annual report on form k  the company and montana power were not able to agree on either the amount of the purchase price adjustment or the methodology to calculate the adjustment within the time frame provided for under the purchase agreement 
the company initiated an action in the supreme court of new york on november   seeking specific performance of the purchase price methodology provided for under the purchase agreement 
any change in the purchase price will cause a change to the preliminary purchase price allocation 
if the purchase price is reduced  the company and wml may be required to use the proceeds received from entech and montana power to pay down the indebtedness described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in the unlikely event an additional purchase price payment is required it would likely be funded by the use of wml s revolving credit facility 
touch america  montana power s successor  has publicly reported that it only has sufficient cash to maintain operations until mid second quarter although there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of this dispute  the company believes its claims are meritorious and intends to pursue its rights vigorously 
the company s ongoing and future business needs may also affect liquidity 
the company does not anticipate that its coal and power production will diminish materially as a result of the continued economic downturn because the independent power projects in which the company owns interests and the power plants that purchase coal mined by the company produce relatively low cost  baseload power 
in addition  most of the company s production is sold under long term contracts  which help insulate the company from unfavorable reductions in tons sold 
however  contract price reopeners  contract expirations or terminations  and market competition could affect future price and production levels 
the company s largest customers include companies which have subsidiaries who have suffered downgraded credit ratings which may later affect the customers as the entire energy industry is impacted by tighter liquidity 
the company invoices its customers for coal sales either semi monthly or monthly and limits its credit exposure by closely monitoring its accounts receivable 
in previous years  wri expended approximately million to repair the dragline at wri 
all of these expenditures substantially increased the productive life of the dragline and therefore were capitalized 
the company believed that  under the terms of wri s agreements with wgi  wgi was responsible for all of these expenditures 
wri expended these amounts to assure continued  uninterrupted production at wri  and demanded reimbursement from wgi for the full cost of the repair 
wgi initially reimbursed wri for only approximately  of these costs 
on march   wri commenced litigation against wgi in the united states district court for the district of montana seeking  among other things  payment by wgi of approximately million of dragline repair costs paid by wri  plus accrued interest 
the company did not immediately record any amounts that may have been recoverable from wgi in its consolidated financial statements 
wgi faced a severe near term liquidity problem and in may wgi sought protection in the bankruptcy court in reno  nevada 
wri filed claims against wgi to recover the cost of repairing the dragline  for overcharges on mining costs  potential royalty underpayment as alleged by the mms and seeking adequate assurances that wgi would perform its contractual obligations regarding reclamation 
in addition  wri objected to the assumption of existing contract mining agreements between wri and wgi 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements and item  legal proceedings  wri reached an agreement in the fourth quarter of that settled all of the pending litigation and was approved by the bankruptcy court 
in addition to a reduced mining price at wri and the provision of security by wgi for performance of its reclamation obligations  the agreement provided that wgi pay million of dragline repair costs and settle claims for amounts withheld by wri for past unpaid mining costs 
these funds were received and the dragline reimbursement decreased its carrying value and will decrease future depletion expense 
the company has certain contract contingencies  which may impact future sales  prices received and cost of operations 
these include  but are not limited to nwr s dispute with tgn  the owner operator of the limestone station  concerning rights of first refusal damages for prb coal purchased  royalties for coal on leases owned by tgn and payment for purchasing shortfalls during the last six months of  and  a price reopener triggered in july under weco s coal supply agreement with the owners of colstrip units and which the company believes will ultimately result in an increase in the overall value of the coal supply agreement to the company 
in addition  there are other issues regarding royalty payments  state income tax audits  property taxes and reclamation obligations and related bonding requirements  which may affect the company  but their impact is not known at this time 
westmoreland terminal company s interest in dta was being utilized at less than capacity and had been incurring operating losses of approximately million per year due to the continued softness of the export market for us coal and a lack of throughput for the company s space at the terminal 
an impairment of the company s investment in dta was recognized during third quarter as the result of the price associated with another partner s sale of its interest in dta and as discussed in results of operations below 
on january   the company entered into a letter of intent with a subsidiary of dominion resources  inc to sell its partnership interest in dta and its industrial revenue bonds for total consideration of million 
a purchase and sale agreement was executed on march  under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement  westmoreland terminal company will guarantee throughput through the terminal for a period of three years 
to secure the throughput commitment  the purchaser will deposit million of the sale proceeds as collateral for a stand by letter of credit for the purchaser 
westmoreland terminal company made certain representations about the status of its partnership interest  the industrial revenue bonds being purchased and the general condition of dta and agreed to indemnify the purchaser for any loss incurred as a result of a breach of these representations 
the liability for a breach of the representations and warranties is capped at million 
the representations and warranties will expire at various times over the next several years 
westmoreland has guaranteed westmoreland terminal company s obligations under the purchase and sale agreement for a period of five years in an amount that will decline to million after years 
as a result  the company will recognize a pretax gain of approximately million when the transaction closes 
closing is expected to take place promptly after receipt of all bank and partnership consents or following expiration of dta partnership rights of first refusal 
at closing  the purchaser will assume all of westmoreland terminal company s dta partnership obligations 
the company will no longer incur dta related operating losses  which were   and  in  and  respectively 
due to the sale of the company s investment  the financial results relating to dta have been presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the company has a class b limited partnership interest in the ft 
lupton power project 
no distributions have been received from that project since and distributions are not expected to resume until due to spikes in natural gas prices which reduced earnings and caused non compliance with debt ratios 
until debt ratios are brought back into compliance  no distributions from this project are allowed 
the company is mindful of the need to manage costs with respect to the timing of receipts  and variations in distributions or expected performance 
for instance  scheduled coal customer plant outages during  primarily during the second quarter  and scheduled outages at the rova power projects during the first and third quarters are expected to reduce revenues and profits during those periods 
also  the jewett mine s recent transition to market based pricing is expected to provide lower profits during the months ending december  than compared to the cost plus mechanism previously in place 
therefore  the company continues to take steps to conserve cash wherever possible 
in january  the company amended its revolving line of credit for general corporate purposes  increasing it from million to million  of which million was outstanding as of december  the company also aims to increase its sources of profitability and cash flow 
given possible future demand for new power generating capacity  stronger energy pricing  the need for stabilizing fuel and electricity costs  and pressure to reduce harmful emissions into the environment  the company believes that its strategic plan positions it well for potential further growth  profitability  and improved liquidity 
the company s ongoing and future business needs may also affect its liquidity 
the company s growth plan is focused on acquiring profitable businesses and developing projects in the energy sector which complement the company s existing core operations and where america s dual goals of low cost power and a clean environment can be effectively addressed 
the company has sought to do this in niche markets that minimize exposure to competition  maximize stability of long term cash flows and provide opportunities for synergistic operation of existing assets and new opportunities 
the company regularly seeks opportunities to make additional strategic acquisitions  to expand existing businesses and to enter related businesses 
the company considers potential acquisition opportunities as they are identified  but cannot be assured that it will be able to consummate any such acquisition 
the company anticipates that it would finance acquisitions by using its existing capital resources  by borrowing under existing bank credit facilities  by issuing equity securities or by incurring additional indebtedness 
the company may not have sufficient available capital resources or access to additional capital to execute potential acquisitions  and the company may not find suitable acquisition candidates at acceptable prices 
there is no assurance that the company s current or future acquisition efforts will be successful or that any such acquisition will be completed on terms that are favorable to the company 
acquisitions involve risks  including difficulties in integrating acquired operations  diversions of management resources  debt incurred in financing such acquisitions and unanticipated problems and liabilities 
any of these risks could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
a key to the company s strategy is the availability of approximately million in nols at the end of the availability of these nols can shield the company s future taxable income from payment of regular federal income tax and thereby increase the return the company receives from profitable investments as compared to the return a tax paying entity would receive that cannot shield its income from federal income taxation 
the availability of the company s nols is governed by section of the internal revenue code of code 
the code limits the utilization of a corporation s nols if an ownership change within the meaning of the code an ownership change occurs with respect to that corporation 
in general  an ownership change occurs if  among other things  percent shareholders within the meaning of the code percent shareholders increase their percentage ownership of the corporation s stock by more than percentage points over any three year period 
a percent shareholder is any person who owns percent or more of the value of the corporation s stock  and the value of the corporation s stock is the sum of the market values of all of the corporation s outstanding shares 
the company continues to monitor the ongoing status of ownership changes by percent shareholders and cautions its current shareholders and potential investors that the creation of new percent shareholders or trading by existing percent shareholders could negatively impact the calculation of the ownership change 
the company believes that  based on public information currently on file  there has not been an ownership change  and that the percentage of change is approximately as of december  if the percentage of change begins to again approach the limitation  then the company may ask existing and potential shareholders for their assistance in minimizing the change 
if the change exceeds the limitation  the company may be unable to use a portion of its nols 
sources of potential additional future liquidity may also include resolution of the nwr dispute with tgn and weco s price re opener with the owners of colstrip units and discussed above  the sale of non strategic assets  reimbursement of amounts paid to the umwa pension plan and increased cash flow from existing operations 
a possible short term impact on the company s liquidity is its obligation in mid to pay the vested benefit of the long term incentive performance units granted in under the company s performance unit plan 
that plan tied the amount of the incentive to the absolute increase in stock value over three years 
the obligation fluctuates with changes in the market value of the company s common stock but is estimated to be million as of december  a portion of the payment may be voluntarily deferred by the recipients to future years using the company s newly adopted deferred compensation plan 
in the course of considering adoption of the deferred compensation plan  the company was informed by all participating members of the performance unit plan that they would defer a significant portion of the pay out for periods of no less than three years 
also  at the discretion of the board of directors  some or all of the obligation can be paid by issuing company stock  to the extent approved by shareholders 
additional long term incentive obligations may be payable in future years but the potential expense is more limited since the value of the awards is linked to the relative appreciation in stock value and is capped 
the company has three separate defined benefit pension plans for full time employees after combining three of five prior plans effective for the plan year 
the future funding of these plans could have a long term impact on liquidity determined primarily by investment returns on the plans assets 
during  one of the plans required an additional contribution of  with increasing contributions expected to be required in future years unless investment returns materially improve above assumed rates of return 
after three of the plans were combined  additional contributions are expected to be postponed until and the total payments reduced 
however  based upon current actuarial assumptions and projections  the required minimum annual cash contributions will grow from approximately million in to million in unless investment returns improve or funding requirements change 
in conclusion  there are many factors which can both positively or negatively affect the company s liquidity and cash flow 
management believes that cash flows from operations  along with available borrowings  should be sufficient to pay the company s heritage health benefit costs  meet repayment requirements of the debt facilities  meet pension plan funding requirements  pay long term performance plan obligations and fund ongoing business activities as long as currently anticipated surplus cash distributions from wml are received 
at the same time  the company continues to explore contingent sources of additional liquidity on an ongoing basis and to evaluate opportunities to expand and or restructure its debt obligations and improve its capital structure

the repurchase program will be funded from working capital which may be currently available  or become available to the company 
during   depositary shares were repurchased by the company at a total cost of  resumption of a dividend payment and the repurchase plan reflect the reestablishment of profitability as a result of the company s successful initial implementation of its strategic plan for growth and the company s continuing commitment to preferred shareholders 
results of operations compared to coal operations 
the increase in revenues is primarily the result of the company experiencing a full year of contributions in from the acquisitions completed in april of the million equivalent tons sold during  all except a few insignificant industrial orders were sold under long term contracts  to owners of power plants located adjacent to or nearby the mines  other than at wri 
beginning in the third quarter of  revenues at the jewett mine were lower  as expected  as a result of the new market based price effective july  which was less than the previous cost plus fees 
equivalent tons sold include petroleum coke sales which are expected to continue through april there was a reduction in tons sold at the rosebud mine due to several unplanned outages at a customer s plant as well as reduced power plant demands at legs which is supplied by the jewett mine as discussed below 
cost as a percentage of revenues decreased to in compared to in with a full year of operations at the acquired mines which have better margins than the absaloka mine 
during the unplanned outages at the colstrip station in  mining operations at the rosebud mine were carefully managed to minimize costs 
some of the tons not sold due to the outages were made up during the year 
the jewett mine suffered reduced demand due to mild weather during the first six months of the year and the economic slowdown which reduced tons sold 
in addition  tons sold from jewett were reduced during the third quarter of due to a test burn of sprb coal at the limestone station 
the following table shows comparative coal revenues  sales volumes  cost of sales and percentage changes between the periods year ended change revenues thousands   volumes millions of equivalent coal tons cost of sales thousands   depreciation  depletion and amortization increased to  in compared to  in due to capital expenditures and a full year of coal production from acquired operations 
independent power 
equity in earnings from the independent power operations was  in compared to  in the virginia projects contributed  in equity earnings prior to their sale in march during and  the rova projects produced  and  megawatt hours  respectively  and achieved average capacity factors of and  respectively 
the decrease in was attributable to a small increase in the number of forced outage days for repairs 
terminal operations 
losses at westmoreland terminal company  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  continued in due to low throughput volume at dominion terminal associates as a result of continued weakness in the export market and partnership cost sharing obligations 
wtc s share of losses from dta was  in compared to  in wtc owns a interest in dta 
wtc is dependent upon its customers coal export business to maintain an acceptable level of throughput 
the coal export business has experienced a significant decline due to a decline in worldwide demand for american metallurgical and steam coal and intense competitive pressure from coal suppliers in other nations 
the company does not believe that those competitive pressures will abate in the near term 
wtc s remaining investment of  in dta was expensed as a non cash impairment charge during the third quarter of as a result of continuing losses and an agreement by one of the terminal s other owners which disposed of its interest in dta 
it should be noted that recognition of the impairment charge did not reduce the company s obligation for continued cash operating expenses or the ongoing recognition of such losses 
as previously discussed  in march the company agreed to sell its interest in dta and will recognize a pretax gain of approximately million when the transaction closes 
closing is expected to take place promptly after receipt of all bank and partnership consents or following expiration of dta partnership rights of first refusal 
the company s consolidated financial statements for and earlier years have been reclassified to reflect dta as discontinued operations 
costs and expenses 
selling and administrative expenses were  for compared to  in the amounts for and include  and  respectively  incurred by the four mines acquired in partially offsetting the increase was lower non cash compensation expense for long term employee performance incentives  with an expense of  in compared to an expense of  during of the  expense in   was for performance units granted in   was for performance units granted in and  was for performance units granted in the long term incentive plan program is designed to link management interests with those of shareholders by tieing long term incentive compensation directly to appreciation in the value of the company s common stock 
performance units were granted in and because the company did not have an adequate number of qualified stock options available for award and lesser amounts were granted in as more qualified stock options were available as a result of shareholder approval of additional shares for options in may  the expense for performance units performance units  unlike stock options  are expensed fluctuates with changes in the market value of the company s common stock 
vesting occurs over three years  but none of the performance units granted in will be paid until  none of the performance units granted in will be paid until and none of the performance units granted in will be paid until  and all can be paid at the discretion of the board of directors in company stock  to the extent the required shares have been approved by shareholders 
the amount payable for the performance units granted in are linked to the absolute change in value of the company s stock 
the amount payable for the performance units granted in and are linked to the relative appreciation in the company s stock compared to a peer group of other companies and is capped to limit the potential amount of variable expense 
the overall increase in selling and administrative expenses in is also due to higher legal costs related primarily to wri s dispute with wgi and an adverse judgment  with associated legal costs totaling million in the basin landowner case as described in item legal proceedings  to annual salary increases  and to the addition of employees associated with the company s growth 
medical claims under the company s self insured plan for active employees were also higher in fiscal benefited from a reduction of approximately  in the estimated liability for reclamation at the bullitt refuse area while had a  additional benefit when the refuse area permit and associated liability were transferred to another operator 
heritage health benefit costs were  in compared to  in  reflecting increased costs for the post retirement medical plans as actuarially determined  despite a decrease in payments made to the combined fund 
during  the company recognized a million gain in connection with an administrative decision compensating the owners of the ft 
drum independent power project for the us army s unilateral decision to reduce the price it paid under its contract with the project 
interest expense was  and  for and  respectively 
the increase was mainly due to the acquisition financing obtained during the second quarter of  despite repayment of million term debt of the acquisition financing during interest income decreased in due to lower rates despite the larger amounts the company holds in interest bearing deposit accounts 
as a result of the acquisitions  the company recognized a  deferred income tax asset in april which assumes that a portion of previously unrecognized net operating loss carryforwards will be utilized because of the projected generation of future taxable income 
the deferred asset increased to  as of december  from  at december  because of temporary differences such as accruals for pension and reclamation expense  which are not deductible for tax purposes until paid arising during the intervening period and due to a reduction of the deferred income tax valuation allowance discussed above 
deferred tax assets are comprised of both a current and long term portion 
when taxable income is generated  the deferred tax asset relating to the company s net operating loss carryforwards is reduced and a deferred tax expense non cash is recognized although no regular federal income taxes are paid 
income tax benefit for represents a current income tax obligation for state income taxes  and the utilization of a portion of the company s net operating loss carryforwards  net of the impact of changes in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the agreement to sell dta in increased the expected utilization of federal nols both due to the gain on sale and a reduction in future losses 
this contributed to a reduction in the valuation allowance related to federal nols and increased the tax benefit and net earnings 
a tax loss in north dakota that increased state nols and deferred tax assets was offset for the same amount by an increase in the valuation allowance since those losses are not expected to be utilized 
the federal alternative minimum tax regulations were changed to allow utilization of net operating loss carryforwards in and thereby eliminating all of the company s current federal income tax expense 
other comprehensive income 
the other comprehensive loss of  net of income taxes of  recognized during represents the change in the unrealized loss on an interest rate swap agreement on the rova debt caused by changes in market interest rates during the period 
this compares to other comprehensive loss of  net of income taxes of  for if market interest rates continue to decrease prior to repayment of the debt  additional comprehensive losses will be recognized 
conversely  increases in market interest rates would reverse previously recorded losses 
results of operations compared to coal operations 
the following table shows comparative coal revenues  sales volumes  cost of sales and percentage changes between the periods year ended a change revenues thousands   volumes millions of equivalent coal tons cost of sales thousands   a includes only eight months of operations from acquisitions discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the dramatic increase of mining coal revenues to  in from  in is the result of adding eight months revenues from the acquisitions as well as approximately million more tons from the company s existing mine 
of the million equivalent tons sold during  over was sold under long term contracts  to owners of power plants located adjacent to the mines  except at wri 
equivalent tons sold include petroleum coke sales 
the mines acquired in average a higher price per ton and better margins than the absaloka mine  which continued its operations 
as a result  costs as a percentage of revenues decreased to in compared to in depreciation  depletion and amortization increased to  in compared to  in as a result of the acquisitions and the large increase in capital assets 
independent power 
equity in earnings from the independent power projects was  in compared to  in the decrease in reflects the loss of earnings associated with the sale of the virginia projects in march  and an increased realization of million in december as a result of settlement of past underpayments at rova 
the decrease in was partially offset by improved results from rova in due in part to the restructured power purchase agreement which also came out of the litigation settlement 
during and  the rova projects produced  and  megawatt hours  respectively  and achieved average capacity factors of and  respectively 
terminal operations

the company does not believe that those competitive pressures will abate in the near term 
costs and expenses 
selling and administrative expenses were  for compared to  for the increase includes  incurred during eight months by the company s four mines acquired in the increase is also due to  of non cash compensation expense in for the management long term performance units granted in compared to  expense in fiscal year and due to  non cash expense for the performance units granted in  which are tied to performance of the company s stock  the price of which increased dramatically during other increases in are due to annual salary increases  bonuses and the addition of employees and related relocation expenses associated with the company s growth 
fiscal benefited from a reduction of approximately  in the estimated liability for reclamation at the bullitt refuse area 
during  the company recorded a  loss on the sale of wellc s remaining interest in the ft 
drum independent power project and a  loss related to the sale of wellc s interests in the three virginia independent power projects 
the recognition of the virginia loss  as well as an impairment charge recognized in the fourth quarter of  was necessary because the service lives originally adopted for depreciation purposes for these projects were greater than the cash flow streams provided under the existing term of the power supply agreements for the facilities 
the proceeds from the sale of the virginia projects totaling  including  from operating earnings distributed by the projects at the time of the sale  were used to fund a portion of the acquisitions completed during the second quarter of heritage health benefit costs increased to  in compared to  in primarily as a result of increased costs for postretirement medical plans and payments to the combined benefit fund 
in addition  a lower pneumoconiosis benefit was recognized in than in interest expense was  and  for and  respectively 
the increase was mainly due to the acquisition financing 
interest income increased during despite declining rates due to the larger deposit accounts acquired in the acquisitions 
as a result of the acquisitions  the company recognized a million deferred income tax asset which assumes that at least a portion of previously unrecognized net operating loss carryforwards will be utilized because of the projected generation of future taxable income 
the asset increased to  as of december  and is comprised of both a current and long term portion

we have included the required disclosures in the summary of significant accounting policies and in note to the consolidated financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk  including the effects of changes in commodity prices as discussed below 
commodity price risk the company  through its subsidiaries wri and wml  produces and sells coal to third parties from coal mining operations in montana  texas and north dakota and through its subsidiary  wellc  produces and sells electricity and steam to third parties from its independent power projects located in north carolina and colorado 
nearly all of the company s coal production and all of its electricity and steam production are sold through long term contracts with customers 
these long term contracts serve to minimize the company s exposure to changes in commodity prices although some of the company s contracts are adjusted periodically based upon market prices 
the company has not entered into derivative contracts to manage its exposure to changes in commodity prices  and was not a party to any such contracts at december interest rate risk the company and its subsidiaries are subject to interest rate risk on its debt obligations 
long term debt obligations have both fixed and variable interest rates  and the company s revolving line of credit has a variable rate of interest indexed to either the prime rate or libor 
interest rates on these instruments approximate current market rates as of december  based on the balances outstanding as of december   a one percent change in the prime interest rate or libor would increase interest expense by  on an annual basis 
the company s heritage health benefit costs are also impacted by interest rate changes because its pension  pneumoconiosis and post retirement medical benefit obligations are recorded on a discounted basis
