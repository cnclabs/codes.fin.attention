item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
general wesco s sales can be categorized as stock  direct ship and special order 
stock orders are filled directly from existing inventory and generally represent approximately of total sales 
approximately of wesco s total sales are direct ship sales 
direct ship sales are typically custom built products  large orders or products that are too bulky to be easily handled and  as a result  are shipped directly to the customer from the supplier 
special orders are for products that are not ordinarily stocked in inventory and are ordered based on a customer s specific request 
special orders represent the remainder of total sales 
gross profit margins on stock and special order sales are approximately higher than those on direct ship sales 
although direct ship gross margins are lower  operating profit margins are often comparable  since the product handling and fulfillment costs associated with direct shipments are much lower 
wesco has historically financed its working capital needs  capital expenditures  acquisitions and new branch openings through internally generated cash flow and borrowings under its credit facilities and funding through its accounts receivable securitization program 
during the initial phase of an acquisition or new branch opening  wesco typically incurs expenses related to installing or converting information systems  training employees and other initial operating activities 
with some acquisitions  wesco may incur expenses in connection with the closure of any of its own redundant branches 
historically  the costs associated with opening new branches  and closing branches in connection with certain acquisitions  have not been material 
wesco has accounted for its acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting 
wesco is a leading consolidator in its industry  having acquired companies since august  representing annual sales of approximately billion 
management distinguishes sales attributable to core operations separately from sales of acquired businesses 
the distinction between sales from core operations and from acquired businesses is based on the company s internal records and on management estimates where the integration of acquired businesses results in the closing or consolidation of branches 
however  core operations typically refer to all internally started branches and all acquired branches that have been in operation for the entire current and prior year to date periods 
acquired businesses generally refer to branch operations purchased by wesco where the branches have not been under wesco ownership for the entire current and prior year to date periods 
critical accounting policies and estimates wesco s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon wesco s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires wesco to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  wesco evaluates its estimates  including those related to supplier programs  bad debts  inventories  insurance costs  goodwill  income taxes  restructuring cost  contingencies and litigation 
wesco bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional adjustments to reserve items may be required 
wesco believes the following critical accounting policies affect its judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts wesco maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
wesco has a systematic procedure using estimates based on historical data and reasonable assumptions of collectibility made at the local branch level and at the consolidated corporate basis to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million at december  and million at december  the total amount recorded as selling  general and administrative expense related to bad debts was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
excess and obsolete inventory wesco writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
a systematic procedure is used to determine excess and obsolete inventory using historical data and reasonable assumptions for the percentage of excess and obsolete inventory on a consolidated basis 
the valuation allowance for excess and obsolete inventories was million at december  and million at december   respectively 
direct write offs against the reserve related to inventory disposals during  totaled million 
the total expense related to excess and obsolete inventories  included in cost of goods sold  was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
supplier rebates wesco receives rebates from certain suppliers based on contractual arrangements with such suppliers 
since there is a lag between actual sales and the rebates received from the suppliers wesco must estimate the approximate amount of rebates available at a specific date 
the asset recorded for the supplier rebate program is within other accounts receivable and was million at december  and million at december  the total amount recorded as a reduction to cost of goods sold was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
goodwill as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  wesco tests goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently when events or circumstances occur indicating goodwill might be impaired 
this process involves estimating fair value using discounted cash flow analyses 
considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate discounted future cash flows 
assumptions used for these estimated cash flows were based on a combination of historical results and current internal forecasts 
wesco cannot predict certain events that could adversely affect the reported value of goodwill  which totaled million at december  and million at december  insurance programs wesco uses commercial insurance for auto  workers compensation  casualty and health claims as a risk reduction strategy to minimize catastrophic losses 
such strategy involves large deductibles where wesco must pay all costs up to the deductible amount 
wesco estimates its reserve based on historical incident rates and costs 
the total liability related to the insurance programs was million at december  and million at december  taxes wesco records its deferred tax assets at amounts that are expected to be realized 
wesco is evaluating future taxable income and potential tax planning strategies in assessing the potential need for a valuation allowance 
should wesco determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
accounts receivable securtitization program wesco maintains an accounts receivable securitization program the receivables facility  whereby it sells  on a continuous basis  to wesco receivables corporation  a wholly owned  special purpose company spc  an undivided interest in all domestic accounts receivable 
the spc sells without recourse to a third party conduit  all the eligible receivables while maintaining a subordinated interest  in the form of overcollateralization  in a portion of the receivables 
wesco accounts for the receivables facility in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
at the time the receivables are sold  the balances are removed from the balance sheet 
the receivables facility represents off balance sheet financing  since the conduit s ownership interest in the accounts receivable of the spc results in the removal of accounts receivable from wesco s consolidated balance sheets  rather than resulting in the addition of a liability to the conduit 
wesco believes that the terms of the agreements governing this facility qualify our trade receivable sales transactions for sale treatment under generally accepted accounting principles  which require wesco to remove the accounts receivable from our consolidated balance sheets 
absent this sale treatment  our consolidated balance sheet would reflect additional accounts receivable and debt 
our consolidated statements of operations would not be impacted  except that other expenses would be classified as interest expense 
developments developments affecting the results of operations and financial position of wesco include the following economic trends the electrical distribution industry experienced a continued overall sales decline in the markets where wesco participates 
the decrease varies dramatically depending upon the product category as well as the market channel used to distribute such product 
based upon our internal estimates  certain of our more significant competitors and suppliers  as a group  experienced an average sales decline of approximately in wesco s net sales decreased approximately in due to lower capacity utilization by many of our industrial and mro customers  coupled with a lower level of plant expansion and upgrading activity in refinancing the company has taken the following steps to improve its liquidity in march  wesco distribution  inc entered into a million revolving credit agreement that is collateralized by substantially all inventory owned by wesco and also by the accounts receivable of wesco distribution canada  inc wesco canada 
availability under the agreement  which matures in  is limited to the amount of eligible inventory and canadian receivables applied against certain advance rates 
proceeds from this agreement were used to retire wesco distribution  inc s existing revolving credit facility 
interest on this new facility is at libor plus a margin that ranges between to depending upon the amount of excess availability under the facility 
as long as the average daily excess availability for both the preceding and projected succeeding day period is greater than million  wesco would be permitted to make acquisitions and repurchase outstanding public stock and bonds 
the above permitted transactions would also be allowed if such excess availability is between million and million and wesco s fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined by the agreement  is at least to after taking into consideration the permitted transaction 
additionally  if excess availability under the agreement is less than million  wesco must maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of to at december   amounts available under the agreement were approximately million and wesco was in compliance with all covenants of the new facility 
wesco has entered into a million mortgage financing facility  million of which was outstanding as of december  total borrowings under the mortgage financing are subject to a year amortization schedule with a balloon payment due at the end of the year term 
this mortgage financing facility provides additional liquidity and financial flexibility for wesco as well as locks in fixed interest rates for longer term capital 
proceeds from the borrowings were used to reduce outstanding borrowings under wesco s revolving credit facility

wesco s liquidity needs arise from seasonal working capital requirements  capital expenditures  acquisitions and debt service obligations 
in addition  certain of our acquisition agreements contain earn out provisions based principally on future earnings targets 
the most significant of these agreements relates to the acquisition of bruckner supply company  which provides for an earn out potential of million during any one of the next three years if certain earnings targets are achieved 
wesco paid million pursuant to this agreement in april the maximum amount payable in any single year under this agreement is million 
certain other acquisitions also contain contingent consideration provisions  only one of which could require a significant payment 
management estimates this payment could range from to million and would be made in to meet its funding requirements  wesco uses a mix of internally generated cash flow  its revolving credit facility  its receivables facility and equity transactions 
the following table summarizes the impact of these items for the fiscal years presented december in millions working capital and other assets and liabilities 
capital expenditures  net of asset sales acquisitions of businesses scheduled debt service obligations internally generated cash flow credit facility activity receivables facility stock transactions other net change in cash in  wesco anticipates capital expenditures to be similar to as of february   the company has no specific near term plans to make an acquisition

interest on this facility is at libor plus a margin that will range between to depending upon the amount of excess availability under the facility 
as long as the average daily excess availability for both the preceding and projected succeeding day period is greater than million  then wesco would be permitted to make acquisitions and repurchase outstanding public stock and bonds 
the above permitted transactions would also be allowed if such excess availability is between million and million and wesco s fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined by the agreement  is at least to after taking into consideration the permitted transaction 
additionally  if excess availability under the agreement is less than million  then wesco must maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of to at december  the interest rate was

in  the agreements had the effect of reducing the interest cost on million of the senior notes from to 
the agreements can be terminated by the counterparty in accordance with a redemption schedule that is consistent with the redemption schedule for the senior subordinated notes 
wesco entered into interest rate swap agreements as a means to hedge its interest rate exposure and maintain certain amounts of variable rate and fixed rate debt 
since the swaps have been designated as hedging instruments  their fair values are reflected in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
net amounts to be received or paid under the swap agreements are reflected as adjustments to interest expense 
accounts receivable securitization program wesco maintains a receivables facility with a group of financial institutions with a purchase commitment up to million 
under the receivables facility  which is subject to an annual renewal in june  wesco sells  on a continuous basis  to wesco receivables corporation  a wholly owned spc  an undivided interest in all domestic accounts receivable

in millions to to after total contractual cash obligations mortgage facility revolving credit facility senior subordinated notes non cancelable operating leases other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations 
in millions to to after total other commercial commitments standby letters of credit management believes that cash generated from operations  together with amounts available under the credit agreement and the receivables facility  will be sufficient to meet wesco s working capital  capital expenditures and other cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
there can be no assurance  however  that this will be or will continue to be the case 
inflation the rate of inflation  as measured by changes in the consumer price index  did not have a material effect on the sales or operating results of the company during the periods presented 
however  inflation in the future could affect the company s operating costs 
price changes from suppliers have historically been consistent with inflation and have not had a material impact on the company s results of operations 
seasonality the company s operating results are affected by certain seasonal factors 
sales are typically at their lowest during the first quarter due to a reduced level of activity during the winter months 
sales increase during the warmer months beginning in march and continuing through november 
sales drop again slightly in december as the weather cools and also as a result of a reduced level of activity during the holiday season 
as a result  the company reports sales and earnings in the first quarter that are generally lower than that of the remaining quarters 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity  under which a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized at fair value when the liability is incurred 
the provisions of this statement are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  the company does not believe that the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on its financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of sfas no 
sfas no 
was issued to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the amendments to sfas no 
in paragraphs a e of this statement shall be effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  currently  wesco is evaluating the impact of adopting the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation under sfas no 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
this interpretation does not prescribe a specific approach for subsequently measuring the guarantor s recognized liability over the term of the related guarantee 
this interpretation also incorporates  without change  the guidance in fasb interpretation no 
 disclosure of indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which is being superseded 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  and the disclosure requirements in this interpretation are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  wesco includes the required disclosure of this interpretation in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation requires unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse the risk and rewards of ownership among their owners and other parties involved 
the provisions of this interpretation are effective immediately to all variable interest entities created after january  and variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest in after that date 
for variable interest entities created before this date  the provisions are effective july  wesco is currently evaluating the potential impact of this interpretation on its consolidated financial statements  however  wesco does not believe it will affect the accounting treatment for its receivables facility 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
foreign currency risks over of wesco s sales are denominated in u 
s 
dollars and are primarily from customers in the united states 
as a result  currency fluctuations are currently not material to wesco s operating results 
wesco does have foreign subsidiaries located in north america  europe and asia and may establish additional foreign subsidiaries in the future 
accordingly  wesco may derive a more significant portion of its sales from international operations and a portion of these sales may be denominated in foreign currencies 
as a result  wesco s future operating results could become subject to fluctuations in the exchange rates of those currencies in relation to the u 
s 
dollar 
furthermore  to the extent that wesco engages in international sales denominated in u 
s 
dollars  an increase in the value of the u 
s 
dollar relative to foreign currencies could make wesco s products less competitive in international markets 
wesco has and will continue to monitor its exposure to currency fluctuations 
interest rate risks wesco s indebtedness as of december  is comprised of million of variable rate borrowings outstanding under its revolving credit facility and million of fixed rate borrowings 
interest cost under the revolving credit facility is based on various indices plus a borrowing margin 
in september and october of  wesco entered into several fixed to floating interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of million 
under the terms of these agreements  wesco pays interest on the notional amount of the swap at libor plus a premium and receives fixed payments at the rate of 
the libor rates in the agreements are reset quarterly 
at december   the net fair value of interest rate related derivatives designated as fair value hedges of debt resulted in an increase of million 
these interest rate swap agreements reduced interest expense by approximately million in the agreements can be terminated under certain conditions 
there is no assurance wesco could find comparable interest rate swap agreements to continue to reduce interest expense at current levels 
at december   wesco had approximately million of variable rate debt  which includes the effect of million in interest rate swaps 
a hypothetical change in interest rates based on these variable rate borrowing levels would result in a million increase or decrease in interest expense
