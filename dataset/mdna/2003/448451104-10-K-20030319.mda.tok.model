item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview huttig is one of the largest domestic distributors of building materials used principally in new residential construction and in home improvement  remodeling and repair work 
we distribute our products through distribution centers serving states 
our wholesale distribution centers sell principally to building materials dealers  national buying groups and home centers  who  in turn  supply the end user 
our builder resource locations sell directly to professional builders and contractors 
our american pine products manufacturing facility in prineville  oregon  produces softwood mouldings 
approximately of american pine s sales were to huttig s distribution centers during during  we completed the integration of rugby usa  inc  the parent of rugby building products  inc  a residential building materials distributor  which we acquired in december in  we turned our focus to expanding our product line and improving our operating efficiencies 
the implementation of our company wide  single platform information system in has allowed us to centralize our accounting and procurement functions and improve the quality and consistency of management reporting and business analysis 
we believe our information system also allows us to leverage our size and serves as a standard foundation for new applications that can be implemented cost effectively on a company wide basis in the future 
we pursue the following business strategies expand our product lines and add higher margin products  focus on providing efficient  high quality customer service through the deployment of information technology and implementation of industry best practices  simplify our business processes to make it easier for our customers and vendors to do business with us  leverage our size to negotiate better pricing  delivery and service terms with our suppliers  achieve operating efficiencies by consolidating administrative systems across the company  and pursue opportunities to expand our product lines  service and delivery capabilities and geographic reach through acquisitions 
various factors historically have caused our results of operations to fluctuate from period to period 
these factors include levels of construction  home improvement and remodeling activity  weather  prices of commodity wood products  interest rates  competitive pressures  availability of credit and other local  regional and economic conditions 
all of these factors are cyclical or seasonal in nature 
we anticipate that fluctuations from period to period will continue in the future 
our first quarter and  occasionally  our fourth quarter are adversely affected by winter weather patterns in the midwest and northeast  which result in seasonal decreases in levels of construction activity in these areas 
because much of our overhead and expense remains relatively fixed throughout the year  our operating profits also tend to be lower during the first and fourth quarters 
we believe we have the product offerings  warehouse and builder support facilities  personnel  systems infrastructure and financial and competitive resources necessary for continued business success 
our future revenues  costs and profitability  however  are all influenced by a number of risks and uncertainties  including those discussed under cautionary statement below 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  which require management to make estimates and assumptions see note to the consolidated financial statements 
management bases these estimates and assumptions on historical results and known trends as well as our forecasts as to how these might change in the future 
actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
we believe that  of our significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
accounts receivable trade accounts receivable consist of amounts owed for orders shipped to customers and are stated net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
huttig s corporate management establishes an overall credit policy for sales to customers and is responsible for all credit decisions 
the reserve for bad debt is determined based on a number of factors including when customer accounts exceed days past due  credit strength of the customer and in certain cases whether a property lien or other type of security is on the past due amount 
our credit policies  together with monitoring of customer balances  have resulted in average bad debt expense of approximately of net sales during the last three years 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
approximately and of inventories were determined by using the lifo last in  first out method of inventory valuation as of december  and  respectively  the remainder were determined by the fifo first in  first out method 
during   lifo inventory quantities increased  resulting in an increase to the existing lifo bases  the effect of which decreased net income by million 
during and  lifo inventory quantities were reduced  resulting in a partial liquidation of the lifo bases  the effect of which increased net income by million in both years 
an additional allowance for excess and obsolete inventory is recorded based on our review of quantities on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales 
valuation of goodwill and other long lived assets we test for impairment the carrying value of our goodwill on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
the carrying value of goodwill is considered impaired when the discounted cash flow model is less than the carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of goodwill 
we test for impairment the carrying value of other long lived assets  including intangible and other tangible assets  when events and circumstances warrant such review 
the carrying value of long lived assets are considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flows from such assets are less than the carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair market value of the long lived asset 
fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
contingencies we accrue expenses when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and we can reasonably estimate the expense 
contingencies for which we have made accruals include environmental  product liability and other legal matters 
based on management s assessment of the most recent information available  management currently does not expect any of these contingencies to have a material adverse effect on our financial position or cash flow 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarter or annual period and our financial condition could be materially affected by changes in assumptions or other circumstances related to these matters 
we accrue our best estimate of the cost of resolution of these matters and make adjustments to the amounts accrued as circumstances change 
insurance we carry insurance policies on insurable risks with coverages and other terms that we believe are appropriate 
we generally have self insured retention limits and have obtained fully insured layers of coverage above such self insured retention limits 
accruals for self insurance losses are made based on our claims experience 
we accrue for these liabilities for existing and unreported claims when it is probable that future costs will be incurred and can estimate those costs 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal net sales were million in  a decrease from when sales were million 
excluding million of sales attributable to branches that we closed  same branch net sales in decreased or million from the prior year 
approximately million of the same branch sales decrease is attributable to the impact of a new competitor in the kansas city  missouri area 
we expect this new competitor to have a continuing impact on sales in our kansas city market for the reasonably foreseeable future 
approximately million of the same branch sales decrease is due to softer sales in our other midwest region branches 
another million of our same branch sales decrease is attributable to lower housewrap sales resulting from the termination of our distribution of tyvek and our transition to typar  a competing housewrap product  which affected sales in the northwest 
also  international sales decreased million compared to due to the weak economy in the far east 
gross profit decreased million to million in from million in the change in gross profit attributable to branches that we closed was million 
the decrease attributable to lower volume was million 
of the remaining million decrease  same branch gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to in versus in the decrease in gross profit percentage resulted from a shift in product mix and pricing pressures in certain regions 
operating expenses were million in compared to million in the decrease includes million of cost reductions from closed branches 
the remaining decrease is primarily attributable to a million decrease in supplies and maintenance costs at ongoing facilities as a result of our expense reduction initiatives during the year  a million decrease in labor related costs resulting from lower headcount than the prior year  a million decrease in bad debt expense  and a million decrease in professional services fees associated with lower legal and consulting fees 
additionally  we incurred lower system implementation costs by million and lower environmental costs by million in as compared to these decreases were partially offset by an increase of million from an increase in our insurance reserves  due to higher claims incidence  expenses of million for costs relating to the settlement and legal expenses of an asbestos related product liability lawsuit and a million increase in rent expense from the facilities which are leased 
depreciation and amortization was million in  which is million lower than the prior year 
the decrease is due primarily to goodwill no longer being amortized  in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which we adopted effective january  in  we amortized million of goodwill 
the decrease was partially offset by a million increase in depreciation expense in the increase in depreciation is due to our capital expenditures during the year to maintain and refurbish our buildings and equipment 
in the third quarter of  we reversed million of restructuring charges for branches that we originally planned to close but decided to keep open 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded million of restructuring charges related to the closure of several historically under performing branches  of which million was recorded in cost of sales 
the charge was primarily for severance  inventory write downs  vacant facilities and other shutdown related costs 
see restructuring activities  below  for further discussion 
gains on disposal of assets were million in for the sale of previously closed facilities 
during  gains on disposal of assets were million for the sale of previously closed facilities 
our full year operating profits in were million  which were million less than nearly all the decline occurred in the second quarter of our third and fourth quarter operating results in were a combined million better than the same quarters a year ago 
net interest expense decreased to million in from million in our average outstanding total debt decreased million compared to the prior year 
the interest rate swap agreements effectively provided for a fixed rate of interest 
during  we recorded a charge of million in the third quarter to write off the remaining unamortized loan fees related to our previous credit facility  which we replaced with our existing senior secured revolving credit facility 
unrealized gain on derivatives of million was recorded in versus a million loss in the gain related to a million change in the fair value on two interest rate swaps that do not qualify as hedges for accounting purposes  which was partially offset by million of expense amortized from accumulated other comprehensive loss established upon the adoption of sfas no 
in see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we also incurred an after tax non cash charge of million in due to the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle related to the write off of goodwill under sfas no 
see new accounting pronouncements  below  for further discussion 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales decreased from  million in to million in excluding sales attributable to branches that we closed or consolidated  same branch net sales decreased from the prior year 
the decrease in net sales was partially attributable to discontinuing the distribution of andersen windows  which accounted for million of net sales during the year ended december  industrial product net sales were million less in versus deflation in the commodity wood market is estimated to have reduced net sales by million in other factors contributing to the decrease in net sales included adverse weather conditions as compared to  primarily in the first quarter of  and the general downturn in the economy compared to the decrease in total net sales also reflects the closing of five branches during  three of which sold andersen products 
non andersen related net sales at these closed branches were million lower in than gross profit decreased million to million in from million in gross profit as a percentage of sales was in versus in the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales resulted from improved product mix 
net door sales increased from of our total net sales in to of our total net sales in while window sales declined from of our total net sales in to of total net sales in in  door sales generated a margin compared to a window sales margin of 
gross profit in both and was negatively impacted by million of restructuring charges for inventory losses which were recorded as an increase to cost of sales 
operating expenses were million in compared to million in  a decrease 
the decrease was partially attributable to lower sales volume  causing a decrease in selling and delivery expense of million 
general and administrative costs were million lower primarily due to lower compensation expense resulting from a reduction in headcount and lower bonus expense 
these decreases were offset by increased warehouse rent and supply costs at our facilities of approximately million and increased provision for bad debt of million 
also included in operating expenses in were million of costs related to the implementation of our single platform information system and million related to our on going environmental remediation work 
included in operating expenses in were million of non recurring costs related to the restructuring of our operations and various integration costs associated with the rugby acquisition 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded million of restructuring charges related to the closure of several historically under performing branches  of which million was recorded in cost of sales 
the charge was primarily for severance  inventory write downs  vacant facilities and other shutdown related costs 
see restructuring activities  below  for further discussion 
gains on disposal of assets were million in compared to million in the gains in both years resulted primarily from the disposal of duplicate capital assets in conjunction with our restructuring and branch consolidation efforts 
net interest expense decreased by million to million in from million in our average outstanding debt decreased by million compared to the prior year  resulting in a decrease in interest expense that was partially offset by an increase in the average interest rate 
the higher rates are attributable to the interest rate swap agreements that we entered into during the second quarter of which effectively provided for a fixed rate of interest 
a total unrealized loss on derivatives of million was recorded after operating profit in this included million that was amortized from other comprehensive income and million related to the change in fair value on two interest rate swaps that did not qualify as hedges for accounting purposes 
the interest rate swap that was designated as a cash flow hedge was determined to be highly effective and all of the change in the fair value was charged to other comprehensive income 
liquidity and capital resources we depend on cash flow from operations and funds available under our secured credit facility to finance seasonal working capital needs  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
our working capital requirements are generally greatest in the second and third quarters  which reflects the seasonal nature of our business 
the second and third quarters are also typically our strongest operating quarters  largely due to more favorable weather throughout many of our markets compared to the first and fourth quarters 
we typically generate cash from working capital reductions in the fourth quarter of the year and build working capital during the first quarter in preparation for our second and third quarters 
we also maintain significant inventories to meet rapid delivery requirements of our customers and to enable us to obtain favorable pricing  delivery and service terms with our suppliers 
at december   inventories constituted approximately of our total assets 
we also closely monitor operating expenses and inventory levels during seasonally affected periods and  to the extent possible  manage variable operating costs to minimize seasonal effects on our profitability 
we measure our working capital as the sum of net trade accounts receivable  net fifo inventories and trade accounts payable 
at december  and  our working capital  days sales outstanding and inventory turns were as follows trade accounts receivable  net fifo inventories  net trade accounts payable working capital  net working capital as of annualized quarterly net sales days sales outstanding inventory turns in  changes in working capital generated million in cash from operating activities due to a decrease in trade accounts receivable and an increase in trade accounts payable  offset by an increase in inventories 
changes in working capital in generated million in cash from operating activities due to decreases in trade accounts receivable and inventory and increases in trade accounts payable 
net fifo inventory increased million to million in at the end of the third quarter and into the fourth quarter of  we made significant purchases of door products and other products in anticipation of customer demand in the fourth quarter  which did not fully materialize 
cash used in investing activities in reflects million of capital expenditures for normal operating activities and million for a warehouse logistics system implementation at selected branches 
these expenditures were offset by million of proceeds on disposals of assets from previously closed facilities 
in  we spent million on capital expenditures along with million to purchase assets from monarch manufacturing  inc in baltimore  maryland and hope lumber and supply corporation in kansas city  missouri 
these expenditures were offset by million of proceeds on disposals of assets during cash used in financing activities in each of the last two years has been driven by payments of debt and capital lease obligations and repurchases of our own stock 
in  we decreased bank debt by million  repaid million of capital lease obligations and repurchased million of stock under the stock repurchase program and million from repurchasing shares from a former employee  which uses of cash were partially offset by million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
also in  we incurred million of debt issuance costs related to our new credit facility 
in  we lowered bank debt by million  repaid million of capital lease obligations and repurchased million of stock 
in august  we entered into a new  three year  million senior secured revolving credit facility  from which we repaid outstanding borrowings under and terminated our former revolving credit facility 
the new credit facility consists of a revolving line of credit that provides financing of up to million  including up to million of letters of credit  at a floating rate of either a libor plus from to basis points or b the prime commercial lending rate of the agent or  if greater  the federal funds rate plus plus from to basis points  in each case depending on our trailing average collateral availability 
the revolving credit borrowing base can not exceed the sum of a up to of eligible domestic trade receivables and b up to the lesser of of the cost of eligible inventory or of the appraised net liquidation value of eligible inventory 
we pay a commitment fee in the range of to per annum on the average daily unused amount of the revolving credit commitment 
huttig and its domestic subsidiaries are co borrowers under this facility  and all of the borrowers assets  except real property  collateralize borrowings under the credit facility 
the credit facility agreement contains various covenants which  among other things  limit our ability to incur indebtedness  incur liens  make certain types of acquisitions  declare or pay dividends or make restricted payments  consolidate  merge or sell assets 
it also contains financial covenants tied to our borrowing base 
if the borrowing base exceeds our actual outstanding borrowing and pre established reserve levels by less than million  we must maintain or meet a to minimum fixed charge ratio 
as defined in the agreement  the ratio is determined for a rolling month period by dividing ebitda plus cash rent expense  less non facility financed capital expenditures and cash taxes  by cash interest expense plus scheduled debt repayments plus cash rent expense for such period 
as defined in the credit agreement  ebitda means the sum of a net income  b interest expense  c income tax expense  d depreciation  e amortization  f write down of goodwill  and g all cash and non cash extraordinary expenses and losses  less all cash and non cash extraordinary income and gains during the period of measurement 
also  revolving availability under the new credit facility can never fall below million 
as of december   we had revolving credit borrowings of million with million of excess credit available under the new credit facility 
at december   we had three interest rate swap agreements  which expire in may  and have a total notional amount of principal of million outstanding 
these swap agreements  in combination with the revolving credit facility  effectively provide for a fixed weighted average rate of plus the applicable spread over libor as determined by the amount of collateral availability on million of our outstanding revolving credit borrowings 
when actual borrowings under the facility are less than the notional amount of the interest rate swaps  we incur an expense equal to the difference between million and the actual amount borrowed  times the difference between the fixed rate on the interest rate swap agreement and the day libor rate 
management intends to let these interest rate swaps expire in may we believe that cash generated from our operations and funds available under our new credit facility will provide sufficient funds to meet our currently anticipated short term and long term liquidity and capital expenditure requirements 
stock repurchases in october  our board of directors authorized a new million stock repurchase program that expires in october during  we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million under the new repurchase program 
under the prior repurchase program  which expired by its terms in august  we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock during for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
of these shares  we purchased  shares from the rugby group limited  our largest shareholder  for a cash purchase price of million  or a per share price of  the closing price on the new york stock exchange of our common stock on the date of our repurchase agreement with rugby 
as part of the repurchase agreement with rugby  the repurchase of these shares did not affect rugby s existing right to nominate up to three members of the board of directors under the registration rights agreement with rugby entered into as part of the acquisition of rugby building products 
we hold repurchased shares as treasury stock and these shares are available for use in connection with employee benefit plans and other general corporate purposes 
at december   we had million remaining under our current stock repurchase program 
restructuring activities during the fourth quarter of  we recorded million of restructuring charges related to the termination of our distribution agreement with andersen and our adoption of a strategic plan to consolidate and integrate various branch and support operations of which million was included in cost of sales 
the charge was primarily for severance  inventory losses and facility and other shutdown related costs 
we charged approximately million against this reserve during the fourth quarter of  leaving a balance of million at december  we fully utilized the remaining balance during during the fourth quarter of  we recorded million of restructuring charges related to the closure of several historically under performing branches  of which million was recorded in cost of sales for the writedown of inventory to realizable value 
other components of the charge were million for severance related costs and million for facility and other shutdown related costs 
severance costs related to approximately employees primarily at distribution center locations 
also  included in amounts charged against this restructuring reserve in was million for inventory losses and million for facility shutdown costs 
during the first six months of  we completed the closure of three facilities 
during the third quarter of  management determined not to close two branches which had originally been planned for closure 
consequently  in we reversed million of the restructuring reserve related to these two branches  the components of which are million for severance and million for facility and other shut down related costs 
the remaining balance was utilized during new accounting pronouncements we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january  under sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer amortized but is reviewed for impairment annually  or more frequently if specific indicators arise 
in addition  the statement requires reassessment of the useful lives of previously recognized intangible assets 
sfas no 
prescribes a two step process for impairment testing of goodwill 
in the second quarter of  we completed the first step of the transitional impairment test and the results indicated a potential impairment in our reporting unit that sells directly to homebuilders 
in the third quarter of  the second step of the impairment test was performed and  based on discounted cash flow models  the carrying value of the reporting unit that sells directly to homebuilders exceeded its business enterprise value 
we recorded an after tax impairment charge of million effective january  as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle based on the change in criteria for measuring impairment from an undiscounted to discounted cash flow method 
goodwill amortization for was million 
in october  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement establishes a single accounting model for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations 
we adopted this statement effective january   and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
this statement rescinds  updates  clarifies and simplifies existing accounting pronouncements 
among other things  the statement rescinds sfas no 
 which required all gains and losses from extinguishment of debt to be aggregated and  if material  classified as an extraordinary item  net of related income tax effect 
under sfas no 
 the criteria in accounting principles board apb no 
will now be used to classify those gains and losses 
we adopted sfas no 
 and therefore separately recorded the write off of unamortized loan fees associated with our previous credit facility as a component of other income expense in the third quarter of also  we reclassified the extraordinary item for the write off of unamortized loan fees to other income expense in in the amount of million  net of a million tax benefit 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement requires recording costs associated with exit or disposal activities at their fair values when a liability has been incurred 
under previous fasb guidance  certain exit costs were accrued upon management s commitment to an exit plan  which is generally before an actual liability has been incurred 
adoption of this statement is required for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  previously issued financial statements will not be restated 
this statement will impact the timing of any exit or disposal activities in which we may engage on or after january  in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which is required to be adopted in fiscal years beginning after december  this statement amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of statement to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
effective november   the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus regarding eitf issue no 
 accounting by a customer  including a reseller  for cash consideration received from a vendor 
this consensus requires that payments from a vendor be classified as a reduction to the price of the vendor s goods and taken as a reduction to cost of sales unless the payments are reimbursements for costs incurred to sell the product or payments for assets or services provided 
the consensus also requires that payments from a vendor be recognized as a reduction to cost of sales on a rational and systematic basis 
this consensus became effective for us on january  we currently recognize vendor payments as a reduction to cost of sales and no change will be required by us in adopting this consensus  thereby having no material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
management change and terms of separation on march   barry j

the resignation agreement also terminates mr 
kulpa s employment severance agreement with us dated as of october  cautionary statement this annual report on form k and our annual report to shareholders contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  including but not limited to statements regarding our business strategy and positioning  industry trends and corresponding opportunities for companies like huttig  the effect of known contingencies  including risks relating to pending environmental and legal proceedings  on our financial condition  cash flow and results of operations  the future impact of competition  including a new competitor in our kansas city markets  our ability to maintain favorable terms with our suppliers and transition to alternative suppliers of building products  such as housewrap  and the effects of slower economic activity on our results of operations  availability of alternative suppliers  our future business success  sales volume and growth  product mix and results of operations  our liquidity  and cyclical and seasonal trends 
these statements present management s expectations  beliefs  plans and objectives regarding our future business and financial performance 
these forward looking statements are based on current projections  estimates  assumptions and judgments  and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties 
we disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any of these forward looking statements 
there are a number of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the following our sales and profitability depend significantly on new residential construction and home improvement activity in markets in which we compete  which is highly cyclical and seasonal 
our sales depend heavily on the strength of national and local new residential construction and home improvement and remodeling markets 
the strength of these markets depends on new housing starts and residential renovation projects  which are a function of many factors beyond our control 
some of these factors include interest rates  employment levels  availability of credit  prices of commodity wood products and consumer confidence 
future downturns in the markets that we serve or in the economy generally could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
reduced levels of construction activity may result in intense price competition among building materials suppliers  which may adversely affect our gross margins 
our first quarter revenues and  to a lesser extent  our fourth quarter revenues are typically adversely affected by winter construction cycles and weather patterns in colder climates as the level of activity in the new construction and home improvement markets decreases 
because much of our overhead and expense remains relatively fixed throughout the year  our operating profits also tend to be lower during the first and fourth quarters 
the building materials distribution industry is extremely competitive  and we may not be able to compete successfully with some of our existing competitors or new entrants in the markets we serve 
the building materials distribution industry is extremely competitive 
our competition varies by product line  customer classification and geographic market 
the principal competitive factors in our industry are availability of product  service and delivery capabilities  ability to assist with problem solving  customer relationships  and breadth of product offerings 
also  financial stability and geographic coverage are important to manufacturers in choosing distributors for their products 
we compete with many local  regional and  in some markets and product categories  national building materials distributors and dealers 
we also compete with major integrated product manufacturers with national distribution capability  such as georgia pacific  weyerhauser and boise cascade 
to a limited extent in some of our markets  we compete with the large home center chains  such as the home depot and lowe s  for the business of smaller contractors 
some of our competitors have greater financial and other resources and may be able to withstand sales or price decreases better than we can 
we also expect to continue to face competition from new market entrants  such as our new competitor in kansas city 
we can give no assurance that we will continue to compete effectively with these existing or new competitors 
the termination of key supplier relationships may have an immediate adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we distribute building materials that we purchase from a number of major suppliers 
as is customary in our industry  most of our relationships with these suppliers are terminable without cause on short notice 
in october  andersen windows terminated our distribution agreement  at which time we stopped distributing andersen windows and were forced to find alternative window suppliers 
andersen windows sales accounted for million in as a result of the termination of the distribution agreement  sales of windows represented of our total sales in both and  compared with in during  we began selling housewrap product  typar  in markets where we used to sell tyvek  a competing housewrap  after our distributorship of tyvek was terminated 
as a result of our having to transition to a new supplier in markets in which we formerly sold tyvek  housewrap sales declined approximately million in compared to although we believe that relationships with our existing suppliers are strong and that we would have access to similar products from competing suppliers  any disruption in our sources of supply  particularly of our most commonly sold items  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we also can give no assurance that any supply shortages resulting from unanticipated demand or production difficulties will not occur from time to time or have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
if we are unable to generate sufficient earnings in order to comply with availability requirements and financial covenants under our revolving credit facility  our ability to conduct business would be limited and we could be forced to seek alternative sources of financing 
our credit facility agreement contains various covenants which  among other things  limit our ability to incur indebtedness  incur liens  make certain types of acquisitions  declare or pay dividends or make restricted payments  consolidate  merge or sell assets 
it also contains financial covenants tied to our borrowing base 
our financial results in the near term may vary from those required by our credit facility as a result of the risks we face in our business  including those that may prevent us from achieving the levels of ebitda required under our credit facility 
we can give no assurance that we will be able to achieve sufficient ebitda or other financial results necessary to satisfy our revolving credit facility covenants 
if we were unable to comply with these covenants  our lender would have the right  but not the obligation  to accelerate the repayment of the entire amount outstanding under the credit facility 
fluctuation in prices of commodity wood products that we buy and then resell may have a significant impact on our results of operations 
parts of our business  such as the softwood moulding manufacturing operation and our distribution centers that sell directly to home builders and large contractors  directly face the risk of periodic fluctuations in the prices of wood commodities 
changes in wood commodity prices between the time we buy these products and the time we resell them have occurred in the past and we expect fluctuations to occur again in the future 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage these fluctuations effectively or minimize any impact of these changes on our financial condition and results of operations 
we face risks of incurring significant costs to comply with environmental regulations 
we are subject to federal  state and local environmental protection laws and regulations and may have to incur significant costs to comply with these laws and regulations in the future 
we have been identified as a potentially responsible party in connection with the clean up of contamination at a formerly owned property in montana  where we are voluntarily remediating this property under the oversight of the montana department of environmental quality 
until the deq selects and orders us to implement a final remedy  we can give no assurance as to the scope or cost to us of any final remediation order 
see part i  item  legal proceedings  for additional discussion 
in addition  some of our current and former distribution centers are located in areas of current or former industrial activity where environmental contamination may have occurred  and for which we  among others  could be held responsible 
we can give no assurance that we will have no material environmental liabilities at any of our distribution center locations in the future 
we face the risks that product liability claims and other legal proceedings relating to the products we distribute may adversely affect our business and results of operations 
as is the case with other companies in our industry  we face the risk of product liability and other claims of the type that are typical to our industry  such as asbestos and mold related claims  in the event that the use of products that we have distributed causes personal injury or other damages 
product liability claims in the future  regardless of their ultimate outcome and whether or not they are covered under our insurance policies or may be indemnified by our suppliers  could result in costly litigation and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations
