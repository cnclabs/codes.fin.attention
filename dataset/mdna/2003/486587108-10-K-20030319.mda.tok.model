during the second quarter of  the company completed the first step of the two step goodwill impairment test required by sfas no 
step one is designed to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of the company s reporting units  as that term is defined by sfas no 
 with the reporting unit s carrying amount 
as required by sfas no 
 the comparison was done as of january  fair values of the reporting units were estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows

future earnings are also anticipated to benefit from improved operating efficiencies and cost containment programs

kaydon does not undertake any responsibility to update its forward looking statements or risk factors to reflect future events or circumstances 
the following risk factors could affect the company s operating results 

table of contents many of the company s customers operate in cyclical industries that have experienced downward economic cycles which have adversely affected kaydon s revenues and net earnings 
many of the company s customers are in industries that are cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general us and worldwide economic conditions and other factors  including capital spending levels 
as a result  the demand for the company s products by these customers depends  in part  upon general economic conditions and business confidence levels 
downward economic cycles have affected the company s customers and reduced sales of the company s products resulting in reductions to the company s revenues and net earnings 
the company expects a general economic recovery in industrial manufacturing and upward economic cycle to result in increased revenues and operating results 
however  the company provides no assurances that any such recovery  upward cycle or increased sales and operating results will occur 
if such recovery does not occur  kaydon s revenues may remain stable or decline and the company may incur lower levels of profitability 
kaydon operates in highly competitive industries and some of the company s competitors are larger and have better resources than the company 
the industries in which the company operates are fragmented and it faces competition from multiple companies across all of the company s diverse product lines 
kaydon expects competitive pressures from new products and aggressive pricing to increase  which may cause the company to lose market share or compel the company to reduce prices to remain competitive  and which could result in reduced levels of revenues and earnings 
kaydon s competitors include us and us companies  some of whom benefit from lower labor costs and regulatory burdens 
in addition  certain competitors are larger than kaydon and may have greater resources 
increased competition with these companies or new entrants to the company s key markets could prevent price increases for the company s products or could require price reductions  which could adversely affect the company s financial condition  results of operations  growth or liquidity and could affect the company s operating performance 
the company s efforts to acquire and integrate other companies and product lines may not be successful  and the company may not realize the intended benefits of acquisitions 
as part of the company s growth strategy  kaydon has pursued  and intends to continue pursuing  acquisitions of complementary businesses as well as acquisitions that diversify the company s product offerings 
the company s ability to grow through acquisitions depends upon the ability to identify  negotiate and complete suitable acquisitions 
if the company is not able to successfully manage future acquisitions  the company may incur losses 
acquisitions and integration of those acquisitions into kaydon s existing structure involve a number of risks  including difficulties in integrating acquisitions into the company s operations  delays in realizing the intended efficiencies  cost savings and revenue synergies  unanticipated problems or liabilities  and diversion of company management s time and attention 
the company derives a portion of its revenues from foreign markets  which subjects the company to additional business risks 
sales of the company s products from the company s foreign subsidiaries and from domestic subsidiaries selling to foreign locations accounted for approximately percent of the company s net sales for the fiscal year ended december  these foreign sales could be adversely affected by changes in various foreign countries political and economic conditions  trade protection measures  restrictions on repatriation of earnings  differing intellectual property rights and changes in regulatory requirements that restrict the sales of the company s products or increase costs 
also  changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and other currencies could potentially result in increases or decreases in the company s costs and earnings and may adversely affect the value of the company s assets outside the united states

the company  along with certain other companies  is named as a defendant in a lawsuit arising from an august fatal accident involving a mhe helicopter manufactured by sikorsky aircraft corporation 
the company believes that the alleged damages claimed in this lawsuit  and the associated legal costs  will be fully covered under the company s insurance policy  but it is possible that such costs will not be covered by insurance and  if so  the company will incur unknown additional direct costs 
further  the company believes that there are meritorious defenses to these claims including  but not limited to  the fact that the bearing utilized in the helicopter involved in the accident was inspected and approved prior to shipment by both us government inspectors and sikorsky aircraft corporation 
these claims have not been finally resolved 
in the past  costs related to legal proceedings and settlements have had an effect on the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and liquidity

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to certain market risks which exist as part of its ongoing business operations including interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s long term debt borrowings under the revolving credit facility and investments in cash and cash equivalents 
the interest rate on the long term debt borrowings under the credit facility is variable and is based on the london interbank offered rate libor 
a basis point increase in interest rates percent of the company s weighted average long term debt interest rate for the year would have an immaterial effect on the company s pre tax earnings 
all highly liquid investments  including highly liquid debt and investment instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less  are considered cash equivalents 
the company places its investments in cash equivalents with high credit quality issuers and limits the amount of exposure to any one issuer 
a basis point decrease in interest rates percent of the company s weighted average investment interest rate for the year would have an immaterial impact on the company s pre tax earnings 
the company conducts business in various foreign currencies  primarily in europe  canada  and japan 
therefore  changes in the value of currencies of these countries affect the company s financial position and cash flows when translated into us dollars 
the company has mitigated and will continue to mitigate a portion of its currency exposure through operation of decentralized foreign operating companies in which all costs are local currency based 
in addition  periodically  the company enters into derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign exchange contracts to reduce the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
a percent change in the value of all foreign currencies would have an immaterial effect on the company s financial position and cash flows
