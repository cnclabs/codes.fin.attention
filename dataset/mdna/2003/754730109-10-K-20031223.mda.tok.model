item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition business environment the uncertainties created by the tragic events of september   coupled with the numerous corporate governance issues that emerged shortly thereafter  have plagued the us and global economies over the last two years 
the effects of those events were exacerbated by the economic uncertainty created by the pending war in iraq  which further dampered consumer and business outlooks in the first half of fiscal as a result  businesses were reluctant to hire new workers and purchase additional capital equipment 
however  the second half of fiscal experienced modest improvement 
during the current fiscal year  the us federal reserve lowered short term interest rates by basis points to  while additional tax cuts were implemented 
this economic stimulus  combined with a more stable situation in iraq  has eased some of the uncertainties in the us and global economies 
capital expenditures began to increase in the summer of  and the dow jones industrial average  fueled partly by a sharp rise in corporate profits  increased significantly in the second half of fiscal  growing by over the level at the end of the prior fiscal year 
while the recent resurgence in the equity markets bodes well for the broker dealer industry  the recent performance is not necessarily indicative of continued strong performance as many concerns still remain about the strength of the us economy 
the budget deficit has risen sharply  and in combination with the already wide trade deficit  is putting downward pressure on the dollar 
additionally  the recent increase in government borrowing has been concentrated at the short end of the treasury yield curve leading to a risk of higher government interest expense when the federal reserve begins to raise interest rates

both interest revenue and interest expense were down in the current year  resulting in a decline of million in net interest income 
the decrease is primarily due to declining interest rates  combined with lower margin and stock borrowed loaned balances  net of increased cash deposited with the company by brokerage clients see the chart below 
the decline in margin balances is attributed to the economic environment and the poor performance of the securities markets through the first half of fiscal year  which resulted in customers generally not committing new investment funds to the securities market and a tendency to reduce risk by employing less margin borrowing 
the equity market conditions also led to a continued decline in the security lending business  as the sluggish securities market resulted in depressed demand for securities

the increase in financial service fees was driven by increased fees from the addition of ira  passport  and freedom accounts the latter two being wrap fee accounts which generate transaction processing fees for trades excuted  as well as higher money market processing fees driven by the increase in the company s money market assets in the current year 
the increase in other revenue is attributable primarily to the first quarter gain of million from the sale of rj ltd 
s shares of tsx formerly its toronto stock exchange seats and an increase of million in mutual fund networking fees  which is due to an increased number of accounts with networked mutual fund companies which pay the company to include their fund positions and activity on the brokerage statements  thus eliminating the need for the mutual fund companies to send confirmations and statements to their clients 
net income increased million  or  to million  or per diluted share  from million  or per diluted share for the prior fiscal year 
the increase in net income is primarily attributable to a decrease in net litigation reserve expense in the current year  as the increase in compensation expense offset the increase in net revenues 
year ended september  compared with the year ended september  total company total revenues of  were down from fiscal year  with net revenues decreasing by only million  or less than 
the decrease was primarily the result of declining net interest income offset by an increase of million in securities commissions and an increase of million in revenues from investment banking 
as it relates to net interest income  the decrease is primarily attributable to declining interest rates  but was also down due to lower margin and stock borrowed loaned balances 
clients remained conservative in their investing during fiscal  borrowing less and holding cash in their accounts  as the equity market remained weak 
the spread earned by the company through short term investment of customer interest bearing cash balances is much smaller than that earned through lending such funds as margin loans 
although private client group commissions were down in fiscal  due primarily to the poor equity markets  institutional commissions  including underwriting credits  were up by approximately million over fiscal this increase was attributable to increases in fixed income and underwriting commissions 
fixed income commissions benefited from the poor performance of the equity markets  which drove investors to fixed income products  while the increase in underwriting commissions and investment banking fees was due to an increase in the number of public offerings  particularly in the spring of net income decreased million  or  to million  or per diluted share  from million  or per diluted share 
the decrease is attributable to the slight decline in net revenue  but more directly to an increase in other expense of million  offset by decreases in business development expenses and income tax expense of million and million  respectively 
due to the market conditions experienced during fiscal year  the company renewed its emphasis on cost control  particularly with respect to travel costs  advertising  and other business development expenses  which resulted in the decrease in business development expense 
year to year comparisons of other expense were distorted by the reversal of million from the legal reserve when the corporex case was settled for less than the judgment amount in fiscal year excluding the prior year reversal  fiscal year other expense was up million  with substantially all of the increase related to additional legal costs and reserves related to the private client group segment  including the adverse resolution of certain recruiting claims 
the number and magnitude of client claims increased dramatically in due to the negative equity market environment

the increase in net revenues is attributed to the modest increase in commissions and the gains in financial service fees and other  offset by a decrease in net interest income 
the increase in commission revenue is primarily attributable to improved market conditions in the second half of fiscal  which resulted in retail investors  who had been reluctant to invest during fiscal year and the first half of fiscal  returning to the securities market with a renewed interest in both equity and fixed income products 
additionally  in the second half of fiscal there were two consecutive quarters of increased assets in fee based accounts 
as the individual fee based accounts are billed on beginning of quarter balances  this increase in assets resulted in increased revenue only for the fourth quarter of in addition  there was an increase in commissions from investment banking activity  which is due to an increase in the number and dollar volume of lead and co managed public equity offerings in the current year for more information on investment banking activities see the results of operations capital markets discussion below 
the increase in financial service fees is attributable to the aforementioned increase in fees from additional ira  passport  and freedom accounts  as well as the increased fees received by the broker dealer subsidiaries for the distribution of money market accounts and mutual funds 
the increase in other revenue is primarily due to an increase in service fees received from mutual fund companies which serve to partially reimburse the company for its processing costs related to items such as statement preparation and tax reporting 
the decrease in net interest income of million is attributable to declining interest rates  as well as declining average margin balances and segregated assets  offset by declining payables under the client interest program 
pre tax earnings for the private client group were consistent with the prior year  reflecting the increase in net revenues offset by an increase in sales commission expense and other compensation expenses of million and million  respectively 
commission expense increased due to the increase in independent contractor revenue  on which there is a higher payout to financial advisors than to employee financial advisors 
the higher payout is used to offset the independent contractor financial advisors responsibility to cover their own branch operating expenses  which are paid by the company in the employee model 
year ended september  compared with the year ended september  private client group net revenues for fiscal year declined by million  or 
the private client group was once again plagued by poor equity markets combined with eroding investor confidence  resulting in lower commission revenues 
the number of private client group financial advisors increased between september and september  translating into increased transaction volume  but due to lower security prices and smaller trades  private client group commissions were down 
in addition  the private client group s net interest income was impacted by both the market environment and by the interest rate environment of fiscal clients became more conservative in their investing  borrowing less and holding more cash in their accounts  as the equity market remained weak 
the decline in customer margin borrowing  coupled with declining interest rates  was the primary reason for the decline in interest revenues 
accordingly  net interest income declined million from fiscal to pre tax earnings for fiscal year were down million from fiscal year the decrease is due to the decline in net revenues and the increase in other expense of million

as a result  underwriting fees increased by million 
the increase in underwriting transactions  however  did not translate into an equivalent increase in underwriting sales commissions as the company acted as the lead manager on fewer deals in the current year 
additionally  investment banking was negatively affected by lower merger and acquisition fees  which declined million due to the combination of one large transaction in canada during the prior year and a general decline in the company s merger and acquisition activity 
volatility in interest rates resulted in a decrease in trading profits in  driven primarily by declines in taxable fixed income products 
pre tax earnings for the capital markets segment were down slightly from the prior year due to the million decrease in net revenues offset by a million reduction in expenses 
the primary contributor to the reduction in expenses was compensation  with sales commissions decreasing by million and administrative and other compensation increasing by million 
the decline in commission expense is due to lower underwriting sales credits  while the increase in other compensation is primarily attributed to concentrated efforts to grow the public finance department  as well as the formation of a structured finance department in the current year

institutional commissions increased in fiscal over  following an increase of in fiscal over two thirds of these increases were related to the sales of fixed income products 
in addition to the increased institutional sales  investment banking results improved in over the level of the prior two years

however  rjbank increased its loans as a percent of total assets from at september to at september loans produce a higher yield than mortgage backed securities  which has allowed rjbank to reduce the impact of the decline in interest rates 
additionally  interest rates began to stabilize in the second half of fiscal  resulting in an increase in interest spreads to an average of for fiscal versus for fiscal non interest income increased by approximately in the current year due to income from the sale of originated fixed rate mortgage loans  which increased over the prior year 
rjbank has controlled non interest expenses during the current year  with those expenses increasing at a rate significantly below the increase in net revenues

additionally  the average interest rates earned charged on stock borrowed loaned transactions declined by  contributing further to the current year reduction in gross interest income and expense

interest revenues and related expense in this activity declined significantly due primarily to lower rates but also due to lower balances  the latter due to the weak equity markets in fiscal critical accounting policies the following is a summary of the company s critical accounting policies 
for a full description of these and other accounting policies  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies  those described below involve a high degree of judgment and complexity 
these critical accounting policies require estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses reported in the consolidated financial statements 
due to their nature  estimates involve judgment based upon available information 
actual results or amounts could differ from estimates and the difference could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
therefore  understanding these policies is important in understanding the reported results of operations and the financial position of the company 
valuation of securities and other assets substantially all financial instruments are reflected in the consolidated financial statements at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value  including cash  cash equivalents  and securities purchased under agreements to resell  deposits with clearing organizations  securities owned  and securities sold but not yet purchased 
in accordance with sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments are reflected in net earnings or other comprehensive income  depending on the underlying purpose of the instrument 
where available  the company uses prices from independent sources such as listed market prices  or broker or dealer price quotations 
for investments in illiquid and privately held securities that do not have readily determinable fair values  the company uses estimated fair values as determined by management 
trading and investment account securities include  at september  and september    and  respectively  of private equity securities 
fair values for certain derivative contracts are derived from pricing models that consider current market and contractual prices for the underlying financial instruments or commodities  as well as time value and yield curve or volatility factors underlying the positions 
however  even where the value of a security is derived from an independent market price or broker or dealer quote  certain assumptions may be required to determine the fair value 
for example  the company generally assumes that the size of positions in securities that the company holds would not be large enough to affect the quoted price of the securities if the company were to sell them  and that any such sale would happen in an orderly manner 
however  these assumptions may be incorrect and the actual value realized upon disposition could be different from the current carrying value 
intangible assets and goodwill intangible assets consist predominantly of goodwill related to the acquisitions of roney co 
and goepel mcdermid  inc now called raymond james ltd 
this goodwill  totaling million  was allocated to the reporting units within the private client group and capital markets segments pursuant to sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess cost of a business acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
in accordance with sfas no 
 indefinite life intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized 
the company reviews its goodwill in order to determine whether its value is impaired on at least an annual basis 
goodwill is impaired when the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the reporting unit 
when available  the company uses recent  comparable transactions to estimate the fair value of the respective reporting units 
the company calculates an estimated fair value based on multiples of revenues  earnings  and book value of comparable transactions 
however  when such comparable transactions are not available or have become outdated  the company uses discounted cash flow scenarios to estimate the fair value of the reporting units 
as of september   million  million  and million of goodwill have been allocated to the private client group of rja  the private client group of rj ltd  and the capital markets segment of rj ltd  respectively 
as of the most recent impairment test  the company determined that the carrying value of the goodwill for each reporting unit had not been impaired 
however  changes in current circumstances or business conditions could result in an impairment of goodwill 
as required  the company will continue to perform impairment testing on an annual basis or when an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
reserves the company records reserves related to legal proceedings in other payables 
the determination of these reserve amounts requires significant judgment on the part of management 
management considers many factors including  but not limited to the amount of the claim  the amount of the loss in the client s account  the basis and validity of the claim  the possibility of wrongdoing on the part of an associate of the company  likely insurance coverage  previous results in similar cases  and legal precedents and case law 
each legal proceeding is reviewed with counsel in each accounting period and the reserve is adjusted as deemed appropriate by management 
any change in the reserve amount is recorded in the consolidated financial statements and is recognized as a charge credit to earnings in that period 
the assumptions of management in determining the estimates of reserves may prove to be incorrect  which could materially affect results in the period the expenses are ultimately determined 
the company also records reserves or allowances for doubtful accounts related to client receivables and loans 
client receivables at the broker dealers are generally collateralized by securities owned by the brokerage clients 
therefore  when a receivable is considered to be impaired  the amount of the impairment is generally measured based on the fair value of the securities acting as collateral  which is measured based on current prices from independent sources such as listed market prices or broker dealer price quotations 
client loans at rjbank are generally collateralized by real estate or other property 
rjbank provides for both a general allowance for losses in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  and a specific reserve for individually impaired loans in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting by a creditor for impairment of a loan 
the calculation of the general allowance is subjective as management segregates the loan portfolio into different classes and assigns each class an allowance percentage based on the perceived risk associated with that class of loans 
the factors taken into consideration when assigning the reserve percentage to each class include trends in delinquencies  volume  and terms  changes in geographic distribution  lending policies  and local  regional  and national economic conditions 
for individual loans identified as impaired  rjbank measures impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s observable market price  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
at september  the amortized cost of all rjbank loans was million and a valuation allowance of million was recorded against that balance 
the allowance for loan losses is approximately of the amortized cost of the loan portfolio and has not changed dramatically since the prior year 
the company also makes loans or pays advances to financial advisors  primarily for recruiting and retention purposes 
the company provides for a general allowance for loan losses on such receivables based on historical collection experience 
additionally  the company provides for a specific reserve on these receivables if a financial advisor is no longer associated with the company and it is determined that it is probable the amount will not be collected 
at september  the receivable from financial advisors was  which is net of an allowance of  liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal was approximately million 
cash was provided by increased client cash balances  payables to other broker dealers and clearing organizations  and net sales of trading securities  offset by increases in client margin accounts and an increase in the net stock borrowed balance 
the remainder of the cash provided is attributed to fluctuations in various other asset and liability accounts net of increased segregated cash and cash equivalents 
investing activities provided an additional million in cash  which is primarily due to the maturation and repayments of mortgage backed securities net of reinvestment and capital expenditures 
approximately million in mortgage backed securities were repaid in fiscal  which is due to heavy refinancings of mortgage loans due to the unprecedented low level of interest rates during fiscal the company re invested approximately million of the proceeds from these repayments in additional mortgage backed securities

the recognition of the liability is required even if it is not probable that payments will be made under the guarantee 
the interpretation also expands financial statement disclosures for other guarantees 
the disclosure requirements under the interpretation are effective for financial statements of annual periods ending after december  and are applicable to all guarantees issued by the guarantor subject to the provisions of the interpretation

it applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development  and the normal operation of long lived assets 
it requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made  while the associated asset retirement costs are to be capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires goodwill to be tested for impairment at least annually  as well as under certain circumstances  and written down when impaired  rather than being amortized as previous standards required 
furthermore  sfas no 
requires purchased intangible assets other than goodwill to be amortized over their useful lives unless these lives are determined to be indefinite 
purchased intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   however  the company elected to early adopt the standard as of the beginning of fiscal as a result  the company ceased all goodwill amortization and therefore did not recognize million of goodwill amortization expense that would have been recognized ratably during under the previous accounting standard 
the following table presents the impact of sfas no

contractual obligations the company has contractual obligations to make future payments in connection with its short and long term debt  non cancelable lease agreements  partnership investments  commitments to extend credit  and a naming rights agreement see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the company s commitments and contingencies 
the following table sets forth these contractual obligations by fiscal year in s total thereafter long term debt short term debt operating leases investments private equity partnerships investment captive insurance company certificates of deposit commitments to extend credit naming rights for raymond james stadium total the company has committed to fund private equity partnerships for a total commitment of million 
at september  the company had funded million of that commitment 
although the remaining balance of million has been included in fiscal year above  the contributions to the partnerships may occur after that time and are dependent upon the timing of the capital calls by the general partners 
due to the cancellation of the company s excess sipc coverage effective february  see regulation under item for more information  the company has joined with other securities firms to form a captive insurance company to provide this coverage 
the company is committed to an investment of million in the first quarter of fiscal because many commitments expire without being funded in whole or part  the contract amounts are not estimates of future cash flows 
effects of inflation the company s assets are primarily liquid in nature and are not significantly affected by inflation 
management believes that the replacement cost of property and equipment would not materially affect operating results 
however  the rate of inflation affects the company s expenses  including employee compensation and benefits  communications and occupancy  which may not be readily recoverable through charges for services provided by the company

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk risk management risks are an inherent part of the company s business and activities 
management of these risks is critical to the company s fiscal soundness and profitability 
risk management at the company is a multi faceted process that requires communication  judgment and knowledge of financial products and markets 
the company s senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and requires specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification  assessment  monitoring and control of various risks 
the principal risks involved in the company s business activities are market  credit  operational  and regulatory and legal 
market risk market risk is the risk of loss to the company resulting from changes in interest rates and equity prices 
the company has exposure to market risk primarily through its broker dealer and banking operations 
the company s broker dealer subsidiaries trade tax exempt and taxable debt obligations and act as an active market maker in approximately over the counter equity securities 
in connection with these activities  the company maintains inventories in order to ensure availability of securities and to facilitate customer transactions 
additionally  the company  primarily within its canadian broker dealer subsidiary  invests for its own proprietary equity investment account 
the following table represents the carrying value of trading inventories associated with the company s broker dealer customer facilitation  market making activities and proprietary trading activities 
the table includes net long and short fair values  which is consistent with the way risk exposure is managed 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for the related gross long and short fair values of trading and investment account securities 
broker dealer financial instruments with market risk in s september  september  debt securities government obligations corporate obligations municipal obligations total debt securities equity other securities total changes in value of the company s trading and investment inventories may result from fluctuations in interest rates  credit ratings of the issuer  equity prices and the correlation among these factors 
the company manages its trading inventories by product type and has established trading divisions that have responsibility for each product type 
the company s primary method of controlling risk in its trading and investment inventories is through the use of limits 
as of september   the absolute fixed income and equity inventory limits were  and  respectively 
the company s trading activities were well within these limits at september  additionally  for its derivative activities  primarily interest rate swaps  the company has established a limit structure that is based on factors such as interest rate risk and spread exposure 
position limits in trading inventory accounts are monitored on a daily basis 
consolidated position and exposure reports are prepared and distributed to senior management 
limit violations are carefully monitored 
management monitors inventory levels and trading results  as well as inventory aging  pricing  concentration and securities ratings 
for derivative instruments  mark to market prices are obtained from an external vendor and are compared to internal valuations 
summarized results are reviewed and a valuation adjustment is determined by management to record the instrument at estimated fair value 
the company s banking subsidiary maintains an investment portfolio that is comprised of mortgage backed securities  as well as mortgage  consumer and commercial loans 
the bank s investments are funded by its customer obligations  including demand deposits  money market accounts  savings accounts  and certificates of deposit 
based on the banking industry and the current investment portfolio of rjbank  market risk for rjbank is limited primarily to interest rate risk 
rjbank reviews interest rate risk based on net interest income  which is the net amount of interest received and interest paid 
the following table represents the carrying value of rjbank s investments and the obligations that fund those investments 
rjbank financial instruments with market risk in s september  september  debt securities mortgage backed securities municipal obligations total debt securities loans loans receivable  net loans available for sale total loans equity securities total investments deposits demand deposits non interest bearing demand deposits interest bearing money market accounts savings accounts certificates of deposit federal home loan bank advances total liabilities interest rate risk the company s broker dealer subsidiaries are exposed to interest rate risk as a result of maintaining trading inventories of fixed income instruments  which are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the company monitors the value at risk var in its fixed income cash and derivative trading portfolios on a daily basis 
using a variance covariance methodology  var is a method for estimating the potential loss in the company s fixed income portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon with a specified confidence level 
a standard regulatory type data set is used one year historical observation period  exponential decay and the results are compared daily against those obtained using corresponding data with a exponential decay factor 
var is reported at a confidence level  based on a day holding period  this is consistent with the company s high turnover trading activity  which is based on supporting customer sales activity 
this means that there is a one in chance that daily trading net revenues will fall below the expected daily trading net revenues by an amount at least as large as the reported var 
however  shortfalls on a single day can exceed reported var by significant amounts 
shortfalls can also accumulate over a longer time horizon  such as a number of consecutive trading days 
the following table sets forth the high  low and average var for the company s overall portfolio during the two quarters ended september   with the corresponding dollar value of the company s portfolio in s high low average var portfolio value the modeling of the risk characteristics of trading positions involves a number of assumptions and approximations 
while management believes that its assumptions and approximations are reasonable  there is no uniform industry methodology for estimating var  and different assumptions and or approximations could produce materially different var estimates 
given its reliance on historical data  var is most effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are no sudden fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions 
an inherent limitation of var is that the distribution of past changes in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk 
moreover  var calculated for a one day time horizon does not fully capture the market risk of positions that cannot be liquidated or offset with hedges within one day 
accordingly  management also monitors the risk in its trading activities by establishing position limits and daily review of trading results  inventory aging  pricing  concentration and securities ratings 
additional information is discussed under derivative financial instruments in notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements of this form k 
as noted above  rjbank reviews interest rate risk based on net interest income 
one of the core objectives of rjbank s asset liability management is to manage the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in market interest rates 
the asset liability management committee uses several measures to monitor and limit rjbank s interest rate risk including scenario analysis  interest rate gap analysis and limits  and net portfolio value limits 
model based scenario analysis is used to monitor and report the interest rate risk positions  and analyze alternative strategies 
net interest revenue is the net amount of interest received and interest paid 
this involves large volumes of contracts and transactions  and numerous different products 
simulation models and estimation techniques are used to assess the sensitivity of the net interest income stream to movements in interest rates 
assumptions about consumer behavior play an important role in these calculations  this is particularly relevant for loans such as mortgages where the client has the right  but not the obligation  to repay before the scheduled maturity 
on the liability side  the re pricing characteristics of deposits are based on estimates since the rates are not coupled to a specified market rate 
the sensitivity of net interest revenue to interest rate conditions is estimated for a variety of scenarios 
assuming an immediate and lasting shift of basis points in the term structure of interest rates  rjbank s sensitivity analysis indicates that an upward movement would increase rjbank s net interest revenue by in the first year after the rate jump  whereas a downward shift of the same magnitude would decrease rjbank s net interest revenue by 
these sensitivity figures are based on positions as of september   and are subject to certain simplifying assumptions  including that management takes no corrective action 
this asymmetric outcome is largely due to the historically low levels of interest rates in the us leading to unprecedented pre payment behavior and allowing for only limited opportunity to adjust rates downward on the liability side 
equity price risk the company is exposed to equity price risk as a consequence of making markets in equity securities and the investment activities of its broker dealer subsidiaries and rjbank 
the us broker dealer activities are client driven  with the objective of meeting clients needs while earning a trading profit to compensate for the risk associated with carrying inventory 
the company attempts to reduce the risk of loss inherent in its inventory of equity securities by monitoring those security positions constantly throughout each day and establishing position limits 
the company s canadian broker dealer has a proprietary trading business with traders 
the average aggregate inventory held for proprietary trading during fiscal year was cdn  the company s equity securities inventories are repriced on a regular basis and there are no unrecorded gains or losses 
credit risk the company is engaged in various trading and brokerage activities whose counterparties primarily include broker dealers  banks and other financial institutions 
in the event counterparties do not fulfill their obligations  the company may be exposed to risk 
the risk of default depends on the creditworthiness of the counterparty and or the issuer of the instrument 
the company manages this risk by imposing and monitoring individual and aggregate position limits within each business segment for each counterparty  conducting regular credit reviews of financial counterparties  reviewing security and loan concentrations  holding and marking to market collateral on certain transactions and conducting business through clearing organizations  which guarantee performance 
the company s client activities involve the execution  settlement  and financing of various transactions on behalf of its clients 
client activities are transacted on either a cash or margin basis 
credit exposure associated with the company s private client group consists primarily of customer margin accounts  which are monitored daily and are collateralized 
when clients execute a purchase on margin the company is at some risk that the client will renege on the trade 
if this occurs  the company may have to liquidate the position at a loss 
however  for over three quarters of the private client group purchase transactions  clients have available funds in the account before the trade is executed 
the company monitors exposure to industry sectors and individual securities and performs analysis on a regular basis in connection with its margin lending activities 
the company adjusts its margin requirements if it believes its risk exposure is not appropriate based on market conditions 
in addition  rjbank offers a variety of loan products including mortgage  commercial real estate  and consumer loans  which are collateralized  and corporate loans for which the borrower is carefully evaluated and monitored 
rjbank s policy is to require customers to provide collateral prior to the disbursement of approved loans 
the amount of collateral obtained  if it is deemed necessary by rjbank upon extension of credit  is based on management s credit evaluation of the counterparty 
collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable  inventory  residential real estate  and income producing commercial properties 
by using derivative financial instruments to hedge exposures to changes in interest rates  rjbank exposes itself to credit risk with those counterparties also 
rjbank minimizes the credit or repayment risk of derivative instruments by entering into transactions only with high quality counterparties whose credit rating is investment grade 
the company is subject to concentration risk if it holds large positions  extends large loans to  or has large commitments with a single counterparty  borrower  or group of similar counterparties or borrowers eg in the same industry 
securities purchased under agreements to resell consist entirely of securities issued by the us government 
receivables from and payables to clients and stock borrow and lending activities are conducted with a large number of clients and counterparties and potential concentration is carefully monitored 
inventory and investment positions taken and commitments made  including underwritings  may involve exposure to individual issuers and businesses 
the company seeks to limit this risk through careful review of the underlying business and the use of limits established by senior management  taking into consideration factors including the financial strength of the company  the size of the position or commitment  the expected duration of the position or commitment and other positions or commitments outstanding 
the company is the lessor in two leveraged commercial aircraft transactions with two major domestic airlines continental and delta 
the company s ability to realize its expected return is dependent upon the airlines ability to fulfill its lease obligations 
in the event that the airlines default on their lease commitments and the company is unable to re lease or sell the planes with adequate terms  the company would suffer a loss of some or all of its investment 
as of september   it is management s opinion that the value of this investment is not impaired 
operational risk operational risk generally refers to the risk of loss resulting from the company s operations  including  but not limited to  improper or unauthorized execution and processing of transactions  deficiencies in the company s technology or financial operating systems and inadequacies or breaches in the company s control processes 
the company operates different businesses in diverse markets and is reliant on the ability of its employees and systems to process a large number of transactions 
these risks are less direct than credit and market risk  but managing them is critical  particularly in a rapidly changing environment with increasing transaction volumes 
in the event of a breakdown or improper operation of systems or improper action by employees  the company could suffer financial loss  regulatory sanctions and damage to its reputation 
business continuity plans exist for critical systems  and redundancies are built into the systems as deemed appropriate 
in order to mitigate and control operational risk  the company has developed and continues to enhance specific policies and procedures that are designed to identify and manage operational risk at appropriate levels throughout the organization and within such departments as accounting  operations  information technology  legal  compliance and internal audit 
these control mechanisms attempt to ensure that operational policies and procedures are being followed and that the company s various businesses are operating within established corporate policies and limits 
a compliance and standards committee comprised of senior executives meets monthly to consider policy issues 
the committee reviews material customer complaints and litigation  as well as issues in operating departments  for the purpose of identifying issues that present risk exposure to customers or to the company 
the committee adopts policies to deal with these issues  which are then disseminated throughout the company 
the company has established a quality of markets committee that meets regularly to review execution of customer orders by the otc  option and listed trading departments 
this committee is comprised of representatives from the private client group firms  correspondent services  compliance and legal and is under the direction of a senior officer of rjf 
this committee reviews reports from otc  option and listed trading departments and recommends action for improvement when necessary 
regulatory and legal risk legal risk includes the risk of large numbers of private client group customer claims  a potentially sizable adverse legal judgment and non compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements 
the company is generally subject to extensive regulation in the different jurisdictions in which it conducts business 
the company s subsidiaries have designated anti money laundering compliance officers who monitor compliance with regulations adopted under the usa patriot act 
the company has comprehensive procedures addressing issues such as regulatory capital requirements  sales and trading practices  use of and safekeeping of customer funds  credit granting  collection activities  money laundering and record keeping 
the company acts as an underwriter or selling group member in both equity and fixed income product offerings 
particularly when acting as lead or co lead manager  the company has legal exposure 
to manage this exposure  a committee of senior executives reviews proposed underwriting commitments to assess the quality of the offering and the adequacy of due diligence investigation 
the compliance departments are responsible for monitoring compliance with regulatory requirements at the respective branch offices of each broker dealer 
in addition  there are compliance officers concentrating on fixed income  equity capital markets and asset management who focus on the regulations specific to those businesses 
the company experienced an increase in the number of private client group claims beginning in fiscal year as a result of the downturn in the equity markets 
while these claims may not be the result of any wrongdoing  the company does  at a minimum  incur costs associated with investigating and defending against such claims
