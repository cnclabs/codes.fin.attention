the following critical policies relate to the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue from the sale of interactive television services in the period the related services are provided to the hotel or guest

the company also has advance billings for certain free to guest programming services where the revenue is deferred and recognized in the periods that services are provided 
allowance for doubtful accounts

collectibility is reasonably assured as supported by the company s nominal write off history

if the financial condition of a hotel chain or group of hotels were to deteriorate and reduce the ability to remit the company s monies  the company may be required to increase its allowance by recording additional bad debt expense 
allowance for excess or obsolete system components

when a certain system component becomes obsolete due to technological changes and it is determined that the component cannot be utilized within its current installed base  the company records a provision for excess and obsolete component inventory based on estimated forecasts of product demand and service requirements 
the company makes every effort to ensure the accuracy of its forecasts of service requirements and future production  lodgenet entertainment corporation form k

this could require the company to renegotiate its bank covenants  significantly reduce its growth plans and or curtail expenditures for operating expenses 
while the company believes it could renegotiate its bank covenants  there is no assurance that this could be accomplished  nor can it determine at this time the financial cost of such a renegotiation or that refinancing  if required  would be available on terms favorable to the company 
the foregoing statements regarding capital expenditures and cash requirements are forward looking statements and there can be no assurance in this regard

the company s business is closely connected to the performance of the hotel industry where occupancy rates may fluctuate resulting from various factors 
reduction in hotel occupancy resulting from business  economic  or other events  such as hostilities in the middle east  other significant international crisis  or acts of terrorism  could adversely impact the company s results of operations 
the overall travel industry has been adversely affected by the weaker general economic climate and the threat of terrorist attacks and the iraqi situation 
occupancy rates from the properties served by the company during were basis points below the level experienced in while the average occupancy rate for the company s served hotels is typically higher than the average of the entire lodging industry  the company s business is clearly linked to the continued effects of changes in occupancy levels 
occupancy rates have been below the level experienced in and prior years 
for  occupancy rates are forecasted to be flat or slightly lower than and may be even more adversely impacted by current events 
if hotel occupancy rates were to decline significantly below forecasted levels  the company s revenues would be adversely affected 
to help mitigate the impact of occupancy levels on operating profit and ebitda  the company continues to firmly control operating expenses and capital spending 
the company plans to reassess its operating and capital expenditure plans periodically to respond to changes in the economic environment 
in addition  the company s room base is geographically diversified  with more than two thirds of properties served being in highway or suburban locations 
in addition  less than of the room base is concentrated in the top ten urban areas of the united states 
by serving a wide variety of geographically dispersed properties  the company mitigates reliance on any one geographic sector 
technological developments  developmental difficulties and delays 
the entertainment and communications industry is ever changing as new technologies are introduced 
technological advances may result in an adverse competitive situation for the company 
while the company mitigates risks by continually designing  engineering  and developing products and systems that can be upgraded to support new services or integrated with new technologies as they become economically viable  there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be successful in these efforts 
in addition  the company may experience difficulties and delays in developing new products and systems or in integrating the company s system with new technologies 
relationships with clients and property owners 
the company believes that its interactive hotel base is well diversified in terms of i location  ii demographics  and iii customer contracts 
as of december   no single customer  state  or province accounted for more than of the hotel properties served by the company

the company relies on its diverse hotel base and geographic diversity to mitigate these exposures  as well as the fact that the company s services are provided under long term contracts  nevertheless  the company s success depends on maintaining good relationships with the clients and property owners it serves 
the loss of any group of customers or the loss of significant number of hotel chains could have an adverse effect on the results of operations 
programming availability and quality 
the company depends upon major motion picture studios for its major motion picture programming content 
the company obtains non exclusive rights to recently released major motion pictures from motion picture studios pursuant to agreements with each studio 
the quality and popularity of the major motion pictures available at any given time and from year to year can vary widely 
generally the more popular titles at the box office will also be more popular with hotel guests 
the company also obtains independent films  most of which are non rated and intended for mature audiences  from distributors and studios 
the company provides music services through an agreement with a third party vendor 
the company provides nintendo video game services through an agreement with nintendo 
the company s success depends upon its ability to provide content that hotel guests are willing to pay to view 
however  the company cannot predict the future popularity or quality of the movies  music  games or other content that the company provides or may provide in the future 
if  for any reason  such content became less popular than it is currently  the company s business could be adversely impacted 
in addition  if any significant portion of the content the company provides to hotel guests were to become unavailable  for reasons which could include licensing difficulties  governmental regulation or issues of public standards  the company s business could be adversely impacted 
availability of capital to finance growth 
while the company believes that its operating cash flows and borrowings under its revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund the company s future growth  its financing obligations  and its negative working capital  if operating cash flows are significantly below the amount anticipated in its current business plan  the company expects to cover the short fall through any combination of additional borrowings available under its revolving credit facility  a reduction in capital spending  and or a reduction in operating expenses 
if the company were to reduce its projected capital spending significantly  the company s growth would be adversely affected 
while the company is currently in compliance with all of the covenants in its credit facility  and believes it would remain in compliance even if hotel occupancy rates were less than anticipated for  if the lodging industry were to suffer a dramatic decrease in occupancy rates  due to an extraordinary event such as war or acts of terrorism  the resulting impact on the company s business could result in a violation of one or more financial covenants 
while the company believes it could renegotiate its bank covenants  there is no assurance that this could be accomplished  nor can it determine at this time the financial cost of such a renegotiation  or that refinancing  if required would be available on terms favorable to the company

assuming other variables remain constant such as debt levels  a one percentage point increase to interest rates would decrease the unrealized fair market value of the fixed rate debt by an estimated million
