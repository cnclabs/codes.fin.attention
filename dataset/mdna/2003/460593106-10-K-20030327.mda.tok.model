application of critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies  which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management believes the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of the company s accounting policies that affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
management has discussed the application of these critical accounting policies with the board of directors and audit committee 
revenue recognition revenues consist of product and service revenues and are recognized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals gaap and related sec staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition 
product revenues are recognized upon shipment  provided fees are fixed and determinable  a customer purchase order is obtained when applicable  and collection is probable 
revenues from reseller agreements are recognized when the product is sold through to the end customer unless an established return history supports recognizing revenue upon shipment  less a provision for estimated sales returns 
deferred revenue consists of revenue from reseller arrangements and certain arrangements with extended payment terms 
revenue from extended payment terms is recognized in the period the payment becomes due if all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
service revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
revenue derived from the development and installation of highly customized software packages under a professional services contract is recognized on a percentage of completion basis measured by the relationship of hours worked to total estimated contract hours and the costs incurred as of the 
table of contents date of measurement 
the company follows this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and contract hours applicable to various elements of a contract can be made 
since the financial reporting of these contracts depends upon estimates  which are assessed continually during the term of these contracts  recognized revenue and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
revisions in profit estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revisions become known 
accordingly  favorable changes in estimates result in additional revenue recognition and net income  and unfavorable changes in estimates result in a reduction of recognized revenue and net income 
if estimates were to indicate that a loss would be incurred on a contract upon completion  a provision for the expected loss would be recorded in the period in which the loss became evident 
warranty reserve the company offers to its customers a limited warranty that its products will be free from defect in the materials and workmanship for a specified period 
the company has established a warranty reserve  as a component of accrued liabilities  for any potential claims 
the company estimates its warranty reserve based upon an analysis of all identified or expected claims and an estimate of the cost to resolve those claims 
changes in claim rates and differences between actual and expected warranty costs could impact the warranty reserve estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts management is required to estimate the collectibility of the company s trade receivables 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realization of these receivables  including the current creditworthiness of each customer and related aging of the past due balances

the reserves also are determined by using percentages applied to certain aged receivable categories based on historical results

changes in return rates could impact allowance for return estimates 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market and include material  labor and manufacturing overhead 
cost is determined on a first in  first out basis 
valuing inventory at the lower of cost or market involves an inherent level of risk and uncertainty due to technology trends in the industry and customer demand for our products 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  management is required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare that with the current or committed inventory levels 
reserve requirements generally increase as projected demand requirements decrease due to market conditions  technological and product life cycle changes as well as longer than previously expected usage periods 
the company has experienced significant changes in required reserves in recent periods due to changes in strategic direction  such as discontinuances of product lines as well as declining market conditions 
it is possible that significant changes in required inventory reserves may continue to occur in the future if there is a further decline in market conditions
