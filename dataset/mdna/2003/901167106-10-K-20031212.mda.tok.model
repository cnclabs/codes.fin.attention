item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this annual report contains forward looking statements regarding tweeter s performance  strategy  plans  objectives  expectations  beliefs and intentions 
the actual outcome of the events described in these forward looking statements could differ materially 
therefore  this report  and especially this section and the section entitled risk factors contains a discussion of some of the factors and risks that could contribute to those differences 
general tweeter is a leading specialty retailer of mid to high end audio and video consumer electronics products operating under the tweeter  hifi buys  sound advice  bang olufsen  electronic interiors  showcase home entertainment and hillcrest names 
we opened our first tweeter store in new england in over thirty one years  we have refined our retail concept to meet the needs of consumers seeking brand name products with advanced features  functionality and performance which we sell through our highly trained  relationship driven sales force 
we believe that our effective merchandising and superior customer service has enabled us to generate substantial customer loyalty 
in  we adopted an aggressive growth strategy to open new stores in current regional markets and relocate certain stores to more favorable sites  and selectively pursue acquisitions in new regional markets and achieve operating improvements by converting the acquired companies to our core operating model and leveraging distribution  marketing and corporate infrastructure 
between and  we acquired ten companies within our industry  for a total of ninety one storefronts  in eleven states 
we funded these acquisitions through a combination of private equity investments  debt  an initial public offering and two follow on offerings 
we seek to increase sales  profitability and asset productivity at acquired companies by converting them to our standard operating model with enhanced training for sales personnel  superior customer service  improved merchandising focused on mid to higher end audio and video equipment and more stringent operating controls 
we also have aggressively expanded our corporate infrastructure over the past several years to support our growth  including expanding our management team with the addition of senior financial  information systems  and merchandising personnel 
we will continue to grow our infrastructure this year  particularly in the area of supply chain  where we have identified a variety of opportunities to pursue that we believe will improve our profitability 
in the beginning of fiscal  our growth plan was to build twenty new stores  and remodel four 
however  we had a dramatic decline in sales in december  which caused us to alter those plans 
comparable store sales for december  which is the single most important month of the year for both revenue and profits  declined by as compared to the same month in in the early part of january  we made a decision to halt as much store growth as we could  and to terminate or postpone any leases to which we were then committed 
as a result  we opened twelve stores during fiscal  with all of them opening in the first half of the year 
we have continued with a limited growth plan for fiscal as we plan to open three new stores  with all of them being prior commitments 
we have not signed a new lease  other than renewals  since our decision to halt store growth in january our growth plans will be very limited until we feel that we are returning to more historical operating profit levels 
tweeter has operated at around a operating income margin for most of the last six years  prior to fiscal excluding our goodwill impairment charge in fiscal  fiscal marks the first operating loss at tweeter in more than ten years 
we believe that this operating loss  coupled with the uncertainty surrounding the economy in general  means that limiting store growth  preserving capital  and reducing debt are the goals that management should be  and will be  pursuing in fiscal comparable store sales have declined now for ten successive quarters 

table of contents we responded to declining business trends by cutting costs  reducing our capital spending  and addressing operating inefficiencies created by the ten acquisitions of eleven businesses over the prior eight years 
during the course of fiscal  we worked on an initiative to move to one company  one way wherever practical 
acquiring eleven businesses over a eight year span resulted in some disparate business processes during the acquisition periods 
we created a list to meet this initiative and report that of our objectives were met in we plan to complete the integration of the remaining areas during the first half of fiscal pricewaterhousecoopers llp was engaged to support our internal audit function in november our goal for internal audit is to help us identify and assess internal controls 
typically  internal audit reports on internal controls with suggestions for improvement 
we are implementing internal audit with both a checks and balances mission  as well as a mandate for education  and plan to use the function to disseminate best practices throughout tweeter 
in may we engaged retailmasters  a consulting organization comprised mostly of former best buy senior executives  and created foundations for winning 
foundations for winning is our overarching internal initiative to provide the company with best practices in several areas including supply chain  sales development  and store level operating disciplines 
our goal is to become best in class in these foundational areas 
for fiscal  supply chain initiatives will be among the largest and most visible that we will be pursuing 
results of operations the following table is derived from the consolidated statements of operations and sets forth  for the periods indicated  the actual amounts  in thousands  of certain income and expense items and their percentages  relative to total revenue fiscal years ended september  statement of operations total revenue gross profit selling expenses corporate  general and administrative expenses amortization of intangibles impairment charge income loss from operations income loss from equity investments loss on investment interest income interest expense income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss fiscal as compared to fiscal total revenue 
total revenue includes delivered merchandise  labor  net commissions on service contracts sold  completed service center work orders  insurance replacement and corporate sales 
total 
table of contents revenue decreased million  or  to million in the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the decrease was primarily the result of a comparable store sales decline of million or  closed stores of million offset by revenues from new and renovated stores of million 
home installation labor revenue as a percentage of revenue increased during the year ended september  from to 
cost of sales and gross profit 
cost of sales includes merchandise costs  delivery costs  distribution costs  home installation labor costs  purchase discounts  and supplier volume rebates 
cost of sales increased million  or  to million in the year ended september  from million in the year ended september  gross profit decreased million  or  to million in the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the gross margin for the years ended september  and was and  respectively 
the decrease in gross margin is due primarily to a concerted effort to reduce open box and discontinued inventory  which required much higher levels of markdown than usual 
the charge to gross margin in the fourth quarter of fiscal was approximately million 
additional pressures on gross margin through the year came from a reduction in suppliers program funds  as the company continued to miss stretch goals throughout the year  as well as the continued growth of the video category as a percent of our overall mix 
supplier program funds year over year decreased by approximately million  excluding the million favorable effect of the reclass related to the adoption of eitf accounting by a customer for certain consideration received from a vendor 
the video category carries lower gross margins than the company average  so as this grows within the overall mix  it will bring the overall gross profit on product down 
this is a trend that we expect to continue through fiscal the percent of video sales to total sales increased basis points year over year 
selling expenses 
selling expenses include the compensation of store personnel and store specific support functions  occupancy costs  store level depreciation  advertising  and pre opening expenses 
selling expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  as a percentage of total revenue  selling expenses increased to for the year ended september  from in the prior year period 
the percentage increase was attributable to reduced cooperative advertising support from suppliers  increased occupancy costs  additional depreciation from the new and acquired stores and higher self insurance costs 
total cooperative advertising funds received from suppliers decreased million year over year  excluding the effect of the eitf reclass 
the amount of reimbursement received after january  upon the adoption of eitf that were treated as a reduction of cost of goods sold but which would have been recorded as a reduction of advertising expenses prior to eitf amounted to million for the fiscal year ended september  we believe that supplier cooperative advertising funds will stabilize or increase slightly in fiscal depreciation expense increased million year over year 
as capital expenditures are below historical levels in and planned capital expenditures for are below historical levels  we expect depreciation expense to stabilize at current levels 
corporate  general and administrative expenses 
corporate  general and administrative expenses include the costs of the finance  information systems  merchandising  marketing  human resources and training departments  related support functions and executive officers 
corporate  general and administrative expenses for the year ended september  increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended september  as a percentage of total revenue  corporate  general and administrative expenses increased to for the year ended september  from for the prior year period 
we expect that the corporate  general and administrative expenses will range between and in fiscal the increase was primarily due to increases in compensation  professional and consulting fees  and fixed asset and other write offs 
compensation increased by more than million due  in part  to million of stock based compensation paid to a newly recruited executive 
professional fees were up million due to payments to outside consultants 
fixed assets and other write offs were approximately million as compared to a gain on asset disposal of 
million in amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangibles decreased to  for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the decrease was primarily due to the write off of goodwill and certain intangibles in fiscal 
table of contents write off of goodwill and intangible assets 
in accordance with statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  tweeter reviews goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite useful lives on an annual basis  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we performed our annual test for impairment 
we performed a valuation analysis of tweeter with the assistance of a third party valuation specialist and concluded that the fair value of the reporting unit did not exceed its carrying amount 
we then measured the amount of the impairment loss by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying amount of that goodwill 
in performing a valuation of tweeter  the third party valuation specialists estimated the value of the business enterprise using i the discounted cash flow method of the income approach and ii the guideline company method of the market approach 
the specialists gave full consideration to the trends of tweeter s business  the competitive environment in which it operates and its financial and operating results 
as a result of their valuation we determined that the recorded goodwill and certain other intangible assets were impaired 
tweeter recorded  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  an impairment charge for its entire balance of goodwill million and a portion of its intangible assets million 
interest income and expense 
interest expense was million for the year ended september  compared to interest expense of million for the year ended september  this fluctuation is due primarily to the increased average level of borrowings on our revolving credit agreement during the year ended september  interest income was  for the year ended september  compared to  for the year ended september  income tax expense benefit 
the effective tax rate benefit for the years ended september  and was and  respectively 
the difference in the effective tax rate benefit for the year ended september  of from an expected statutory rate of primarily relates to nondeductible expenses 
excluding the impairment charge of million and the related tax benefit of million  the effective tax rate for the year ended september  would have been 
management expects that the effective tax rate will be in fiscal fiscal as compared to fiscal total revenue 
total revenue increased million  or  to million in the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the increase was primarily comprised of revenues of million derived from acquired stores from the date of acquisition and million from new stores 
this was offset by a comparable store sales decrease of million or 
home installation labor revenue as a percentage of revenue doubled during the year ended september  from to 
cost of sales and gross profit 
cost of sales increased million  or  to million in the year ended september  from million in the year ended september  gross profit increased million  or  to million in the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the gross margin for the years ended september  and was and  respectively 
the increase in gross margin is due primarily to higher product margins  as a result of a change in mix  and the reduction of inventory shrink 
selling expenses 
selling expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  as a percentage of total revenue  selling expenses increased to for the year ended september  from in the prior year period 
the percentage increase was attributable to million more fees associated with extended credit card financing  million increased occupancy costs  million additional depreciation from the new and acquired stores and million higher insurance costs 
corporate  general and administrative expenses 
corporate  general and administrative expenses for the year ended september  increased to million from million for the year ended september  as a percentage of total revenue  corporate  general and administrative expenses 
table of contents increased to for the year ended september  from for the prior year period 
the increase was due to higher occupancy costs relative to the acquired companies  payroll and depreciation 
amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangibles decreased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the decrease was due to the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this statement requires that amortization be recorded only on intangible assets with definitive lives and not on goodwill or intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
impairment charge 
during fiscal  a sustained reduction in the company s market capitalization indicated that the carrying value of goodwill and other intangibles may have been impaired 
based on this  the company hired an independent third party to prepare a valuation analysis and the results of the valuation indicated that the goodwill recorded was fully impaired 
for the fiscal year ended september   an impairment charge of million was taken to write off all recorded goodwill and certain intangibles 
interest income and expense 
interest expense was million for the year ended september  compared to interest expense of  for the year ended september  this fluctuation is due primarily to the borrowings on our revolving credit agreement during the year ended september  compared to cash investment income realized on our outstanding cash balances during the first ten months of the year ended september  the increase in borrowings was due to the debt acquired in the sound advice acquisition and the opening of new stores 
interest income was  for the year ended september  compared to million for the year ended september   primarily due to the decrease in the cash balance 
income tax expense benefit 
the effective tax rate benefit for the years ended september  and was and  respectively 
excluding the impairment charge of million and the related tax benefit of million  the effective tax rate for the year ended september  would have been 
the tax benefit  in part  is attributable to the portion of goodwill impaired that was deductible for income tax purposes 
liquidity and capital resources our cash needs are primarily for working capital to support our inventory requirements and capital expenditures  pre opening expenses and beginning inventory for new stores and for remodeling or relocating older stores 
additionally  capital needs are created as acquisition opportunities are pursued 
our primary sources of financing have been net cash from operations  borrowings under our credit facility  and proceeds from the sale of equity or subordinated notes 
at september  and  our working capital was million and million  respectively 
cash provided by operations was million for the year ended september  this was a result of an million loss  depreciation and amortization of million  a decrease of million of inventory  a decrease of million of accounts payable and accrued expenses  an increase of million in customer deposits  a decrease of million in accounts receivable and a million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets  primarily related to tax assets recorded in conjunction with the write off of goodwill  as well as minor changes in other operating accounts 
net cash used in investing activities during fiscal was approximately million 
purchase of property and equipment of million was the primary use of cash in investing activities 
approximately million was used to open twelve new stores and relocate remodel four stores and the balance of million was used for other miscellaneous capital expenditures for equipment  fixtures and leasehold improvements 
in fiscal  net proceeds of million were received from the sale of two of the company s owned properties  which the company now leases from the buyer 
there are no other material commitments for capital expenditures other than new store openings and remodeling or relocating existing stores  which is estimated to total million in the next months 
on april   the company entered into an agreement with its lenders for a new three year senior secured revolving credit facility in the amount of million 
the facility replaces a million line of credit that was due to expire in availability under the credit facility will be based on a borrowing base 
table of contents tied to a percentage of eligible inventory  receivables and real estate 
the interest rate on the new facility ranges from to over libor  provided the company commits the loan balances for a period of thirty days or more  or to 
over the prime rate 
the line is secured by substantially all of the assets of the company and its subsidiaries and contains various covenants and restrictions  including that i tweeter cannot create  incur  assume or permit additional indebtedness  ii tweeter cannot create  incur  assume or permit any lien on any property or asset  iii tweeter cannot merge or consolidate with any other person or permit any other person to merge or consolidate with the company  iv tweeter cannot purchase  hold or acquire any investment in any other person except those specifically permitted  v tweeter cannot sell  transfer  lease  or otherwise dispose of any asset except permitted exceptions  and vi tweeter cannot declare or make any restricted payments 
the borrowers under the credit facility will be subsidiaries of tweeter  and tweeter will be a guarantor of any amounts borrowed 
in addition  there is a commitment fee for the unused portion of the line of 
our weighted average interest rate on outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and our prior credit facility for fiscal was approximately 
the credit facility has a maturity date of april   and there are not any required quarterly or monthly principal prepayments under the facility 
as of september    was available under the revolving credit facility 
under the credit facility as originally signed  we were required to maintain a certain fixed charge coverage ratio as of the end of each month 
on august   we amended the agreement to eliminate this requirement  and replaced it with additional reserves in the amount of million  used when computing the available borrowing base under the facility 
the company s contractual obligations and due dates consist of the following at september  total thereafter credit facility operating leases name in title sponsorships capital leases and other total tweeter believes that its existing cash  together with cash generated by operations and available borrowings under the credit facility  will be sufficient to finance its working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
furthermore  due to the seasonality if its business  tweeter s working capital needs are significantly higher in the fiscal third and fourth quarters and there is the possibility that this could cause unforeseen capital constraints in the future 
within our credit facility  there is an option during our peak holiday season buying periods to have more availability on our credit line to meet these needs 
impact of inflation management does not believe that inflation has had a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
however  we cannot predict accurately the effect of inflation on future operating results 
seasonality our business is subject to seasonal variations 
historically  we have realized a significant portion of our total revenue and net income for the year during the first and fourth fiscal quarters  with a majority of net income for such quarters realized in the first fiscal quarter 
due to the importance of the holiday shopping season  any factors negatively impacting the holiday selling season could have an adverse effect on our revenues and our ability to generate a profit 
our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors  including the timing of new store openings and acquisitions and unexpected changes in volume related rebates or changes in cooperative advertising policies from manufacturers 
in addition  operating results may be negatively affected by increases in merchandise costs  price changes in response to competitive factors and unfavorable local  regional or national economic developments that result in reduced consumer spending 

table of contents critical accounting policies presented below is a discussion about our application of critical accounting policies that require us to make assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made  and where different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  would have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
management has identified the following accounting estimates as critical for tweeter  and will discuss them separately below allowance for bad and doubtful accounts  inventory obsolescence provision  income tax accruals  self insurance reserves  and deferred cash discounts  volume rebates and coop advertising 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to it in this md a 
allowance for bad and doubtful accounts most of our accounts receivable are due from our suppliers and less than are due from retail customers 
our net accounts receivable balance at september  of million constitutes of our total assets  and the reserve of million is of gross accounts receivable 
we categorize our accounts receivable by business type and estimate our bad debt reserve using four aging classifications current  thirty one to sixty days  sixty one to ninety days and over ninety days 
for each business type  based on the amounts in each aging category  we apply a percentage to determine the amount of the reserve to be applied to each category 
if a further review of a business type shows that this methodology needs to be adjusted  the percentage of reserve is adjusted accordingly 
in recent years  as a result of a combination of the factors described above  we have increased our bad debt reserve to reflect our estimated valuation of gross receivables 
it is also possible that bad debt write off could increase significantly in the future 
we have historically estimated our bad and doubtful debt allowance as a percentage of the aging categories  which could differ materially if the historical trend changed 
estimating an allowance for doubtful accounts requires significant management judgment 
in addition  different reserve estimates that we reasonably could have used would have had a material impact on our reported accounts receivable balance and thus would have had a material impact on the presentation of the results of operations 
for those reasons  and in view of the fact that our accounts receivable balance is of our total assets at september   we believe that the accounting estimate related to bad and doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate 
inventory obsolescence inventory represents a significant portion of our assets 
our profitability and viability is highly dependent on the demand for our products 
an imbalance between purchasing levels and sales could cause rapid and material obsolescence  and loss of competitive price advantage and market share 
we believe that our product mix has provided sufficient diversification to mitigate this risk 
at the end of each reporting period  we reduce the value by our estimate of what we believe to be obsolete  and we recognize an expense of the same amount  which is included in cost of sales in our consolidated statement of operations 
in our industry  merchandise models change periodically 
when they do  we reclassify the old model into a discontinued category 
we also reclassify merchandise into the discontinued category when we decide we no longer want to sell the item 
generally  we attempt to sell these discontinued models at standard retail prices 
in estimating our obsolescence reserve  we analyze the sales of discontinued merchandise by department and determine what profit or loss was recorded in the quarter 
if product of the discontinued department is sold for below cost during the quarter  then we apply that negative percentage to the value of the inventory on hand as of the balance sheet date 
in addition to this reserve we also identify the selling costs to be incurred in the sale of such discontinued inventory and add that to this obsolescence reserve 
we also evaluate the obsolescence of 
table of contents our service parts inventory based on the aging of this inventory 
we apply a percentage to each aging category in order to determine the reserve amount 
as a result of a combination of the factors described above  we have reduced our net inventory value to reflect our estimated amount of inventory obsolescence 
our inventory obsolescence reserve at september  is million 
it is also possible that obsolescence could rapidly become a significant issue in the future 
in addition  different reserve estimates that we reasonably could have used would have had a material impact on our reported net inventory and cost of sales  and thus would have had a material impact on the presentation of our results of operations 
for those reasons  we believe that the accounting estimate related to inventory obsolescence is a critical accounting estimate 
income taxes our estimate of the expense or benefit and the sufficiency of the income tax accrual is somewhat dependent on our assessment of certain tax filing exposures 
we provide for potential tax exposures arising from routine audits by taxing agencies 
it is reasonably possible to assume that actual amounts payable as a result of such audits could be materially different from amounts accrued in the consolidated balance sheet 
our estimate of deferred tax assets is impacted by our assessment of our ability to generate sufficient taxable income to be able to realize the deferred tax asset 
based on management s assessment of our historical performance and the current economic conditions  we have determined that no valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset is required as of september  as we believe that we will be sufficiently profitable as to realize all recognized deferred tax assets 
should we not generate the expected levels of taxable income  a valuation allowance could be required 
self insurance reserves we are self insured for workers compensation  general liability insurance and medical dental benefits and evaluate our liability estimate on a quarterly basis based on actuarial information and past experience 
historical claims are reviewed as to when they are incurred versus when they are actually paid and an average claims lag is determined 
once the average historical lag is determined  it is applied to the current level of claims being processed 
management believes  and past experience has confirmed  the underwriting cost reductions outweigh the financial risk incurred by self insurance of workers compensation  general liability and medical dental benefits 
accounting standards require that a related loss contingency be recognized in our consolidated balance sheet 
we determined that the total future liability related to claims that have already been incurred but have not been billed is million  compared to our estimate last year of million 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to assessment of future liability for current insurance claims is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period due to the requirement that our management make assumptions about future costs of claims based on historical costs 
deferred cash discounts  volume rebates and coop advertising we receive cash discounts for timely payment of merchandise invoices and recognize these amounts in our statement of operations upon the sale of the inventory 
the amount of the deferral for discounts received but not yet recognized in income is million as of september   compared to million as of september  and is classified as a reduction in gross inventory in the consolidated balance sheet 
we also receive substantial funds from our suppliers for volume rebates and coop advertising 
these funds can be earned in two ways  the first is based on levels of inventory purchases and the second is based on performance of specific advertising activities 
amounts earned based on levels of inventory purchases are recognized in the income statement based on when the inventory from each supplier is sold 
amounts earned based on performance of specific advertising activities are recognized in the income statement as these activities are performed 
the amount of the deferral for amounts received related to levels of inventory 
table of contents purchases is million  as of september   compared to million as of september  no amounts were deferred as of september  for specific advertising activities as we did not have any unfulfilled obligations in relation to cash received prior to the year end 
many of our agreements include stretch goals where the level of funds earned is dependent upon achieving certain purchase levels 
we record these program funds as a reduction of inventory costs when we determine that we are likely to achieve the goal 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to deferred cash discounts  volume rebates and coop advertising is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period due to changes in inventory levels  the supplier mix of the inventory on hand  and the timing of performance of specific advertising activities in relation to when the cash for these activities is received
