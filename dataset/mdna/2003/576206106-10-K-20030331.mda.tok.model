item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations effective january   the company changed to a calendar year basis of reporting financial results 
for comparative purposes  the reported audited consolidated results of operations and cash flows for the and annual periods are for the twelve months ended october as a requirement of the change in fiscal year  the company is reporting consolidated results of operations and cash flows for a special transition period  the two months ended december  audited compared with the two months ended december  unaudited 
the comparative audited balance sheets are as of december  and october  results of operations compared with produced coal revenue for the year ended december   increased percent to  million compared with  million for the year ended october  two factors that impacted produced coal revenue for compared to were o the volume of produced tons sold decreased percent to million tons in from million tons in  attributable to a reduction in metallurgical and industrial tons sold of and percent  respectively  and o the produced coal revenue per ton sold increased percent to per ton in from per ton in  consisting of   and percent increases to the prices for utility  metallurgical and industrial coal  respectively 
realized prices for our produced tonnage sold in reflected the improvement seen in the market during  as spot market prices of central appalachian coal increased to year highs  and we were able to obtain sales commitments at relatively higher prices 
however  during the soft economic environment  weak steel demand and the higher stockpiles built by the utilities due to the unusually mild weather that prevailed in the eastern united states during the winter of significantly reduced demand for all grades of coal 
freight and handling revenue decreased percent to million in compared with million in revenue from purchased coal sales increased million  or percent  from million in to million in this increase was due to an increase in purchased tons sold  which grew by million tons to million in from million in massey purchases varying amounts of coal each year to supplement produced coal 
other revenue  which consists of royalties  rentals  coal handling facility fees  gas well revenue  synfuel earnings  gains on the sale of non strategic assets  contract buyout payments  and miscellaneous income  increased to million for from million for the increase was primarily due to contract buyout payments of million from several customers  including million from one large customer  as well as increased earnings related to the sale of an interest in  and the operation of  appalachian synfuel  llc 
the contract buyout payments in were a result of several customers negotiating settlement of above market price contracts for tonnage in lieu of accepting delivery 
cost of produced coal revenue increased approximately percent to  million for from  million for cost of produced coal revenue on a per ton of coal sold basis increased by percent in compared with this increase was partially due to a pre tax charge taken in the second quarter of in the amount of million related to an adverse jury verdict in the west virginia harman mining corporation lawsuit  as well as a fourth quarter charge of million related to an arbitration award in a contract dispute 
additionally  the reduction in tons sold  poor productivity at our longwalls  as well as at some room and pillar and surface mining operations  and higher wage and benefit costs contributed to the increase 
during  in response to the market improvement  we increased staffing and benefits costs in order to increase production 
however  due to the subsequent market weakness  we reduced total workforce during the first quarter of by approximately percent and idled continuous miner sections 
cost of produced coal revenue for includes pre tax charges of million related to the write off of longwall panel development costs at the jerry fork longwall mine  million related to the settlement with the state of west virginia regarding worker s compensation liabilities incurred by independent contractors  and million related to an increase in reserves for a wrongful employee discharge suit 
these costs in were partially offset by a million pre tax refund related to black lung excise taxes paid on coal export sales tonnage 
tons produced in were million compared to million in freight and handling costs decreased percent to million in compared with million in costs of purchased coal revenue increased million to million in from million in this was due to the million ton increase in purchased tons sold to million in from million in  as well as the higher cost per ton paid for the purchased coal 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a increased by approximately percent to million in compared to million for the increase of million was primarily due to a million pre tax write off of mine development costs at certain idled mines in  as well as increased capital expenditures made in recent years in an effort to increase production 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for compared to million for the increase was primarily attributable to increases in accruals related to long term executive compensation programs and costs of legal services  offset by a reduction in bad debt reserves for a receivable from a large bankrupt customer  wheeling pittsburgh steel corporation  which totaled million pre tax during the first quarter of interest income decreased to million for compared with million for this decrease was due to million pre tax of interest income in for interest due on the black lung excise tax refund 
interest expense increased to million for compared with million for the higher interest expense was due to interest of million pre tax paid in the fourth quarter of on the judgment in the virginia harman mining corporation action after the dismissal of the appeal in the third quarter of income tax benefit was million for compared with income tax benefit of million for the benefit includes a refund for the settlement of a state tax dispute in the amount of million  net of federal tax 
compared with produced coal revenue increased to  million in as compared to  million for the previous year 
two factors that impacted produced coal revenue for compared to were o the volume of produced tons sold increased by percent from million tons in to million tons in this increase consisted of a percent increase in utility tons sold and a percent increase in industrial tons sold  offset in part by a decrease of percent in metallurgical tons sold 
o the produced coal revenue per ton sold increased by percent from in to in the market for utility coal continued to improve during the fiscal year as spot market prices of central appalachian coal increased to year highs 
unfortunately  most of the massey tonnage sold in was committed prior to the upturn in the market 
freight and handling revenue decreased million to million in compared with million in revenue from purchased coal sales increased percent to million in from million in  due to an increase in spot prices for coal  as purchased tons sold were million in and massey purchases varying amounts of coal each year to supplement produced coal 
other revenue  which consists of royalties  rentals  miscellaneous income and gains on the sale of non strategic assets  decreased percent to million for compared with million for the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in income from dispositions of non strategic mineral reserves  which generated million in compared to million in as part of its management of coal reserves  massey regularly sells non strategic reserves or exchanges them for reserves located in more synergistic locations 
in  massey sold certain non strategic coal reserves scarlet duncan fork reserves with a net book value of million 
massey received million in consideration in the form of cash 
a gain of million was recognized in  as million was deferred due to a leaseback option of a portion of the reserves sold 
in  massey sold certain non strategic coal reserves dials branch reserves with a net book value of million 
massey received consideration in the amount of million 
the consideration was comprised of a note receivable in the amount of million for guaranteed deferred royalty payments through  less million of assumed liabilities 
the dials branch reserves sale resulted in a gain of million being recognized in massey recognized an additional million of gains in from several smaller asset sales 
cost of produced coal revenue increased percent to  million for from million in this was partially due to the increase in tons sold 
cost of produced coal revenue on a per ton sold basis increased by percent to for the fiscal year compared to in fiscal this increase in cost was related to both the direct cost of labor and the decreases in productivity resulting from a greater percentage of inexperienced miners 
this was due  in part  to the company s efforts to increase production 
in addition  heavy rains in southern west virginia in july increased employee absenteeism and disrupted loading operations and rail service  slowing coal shipping 
other operational problems impacted production and costs throughout the fiscal year 
operating difficulties and problematic geologic conditions were encountered at several longwall mines and during the expansion of massey s two large surface mines  where we experienced higher than expected overburden ratios in the first half of the year 
the ellis eagle longwall mine experienced flooding that caused significant disruption to coal production during april and may 
the flooding caused reduced shipments from both the marfork and goals preparation plants 
increases in operating costs related to the martin county coal slurry spill and the idling of the martin county coal preparation plant from october   to april   also negatively impacted cost of sales 
cost of produced coal revenue for and includes credits of million and million  respectively  related to refunds of black lung excise taxes paid on coal export sales tonnage 
black lung excise taxes on exported coal were determined to be unconstitutional by a federal district court decision 
during  the internal revenue service substantially completed its audit of the company s requested refund of black lung excise tax payments 
cost of produced coal revenue for also includes pre tax charges of million related to the write off of longwall panel development costs at the jerry fork longwall mine  million related to the settlement with the state of west virginia regarding worker s compensation liabilities incurred by independent contractors  and million related to an increase in reserves for a wrongful employee discharge suit 
these costs in were partially offset by a million benefit arising from the settlement of insurance claims from the august upper cedar grove longwall failure 
freight and handling costs decreased million to million in compared with million in costs of purchased coal revenue increased percent to million in from million in this was due to the increase in spot prices for coal  as purchased tons sold were million in and massey purchases varying amounts of coal each year to supplement produced coal 
depreciation  depletion and amortization increased to million for from million in the increase of million was primarily due to the level of capital expenditures in recent years 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased percent to million for compared with million for this was due in part to a million bad debt expense in associated with the bankruptcy of a major steel industry customer as well as a reduction in accruals related to long term executive compensation plans  partially offset by additions to the administrative workforce associated with running a stand alone publicly traded company 
interest income decreased to million for compared to million for this decrease was primarily due to the elimination of the company s loans with fluor corporation in connection with the spin off transaction on november  additionally  in the second quarter of  million was accrued for interest due on the black lung excise tax refund as noted above  while in the third fiscal quarter of  million was accrued for interest on the black lung excise tax refund 
interest expense increased to million for the increase was due to the addition of the percent senior notes and commercial paper borrowings subsequent to the spin off 
income tax benefit was million for compared to an income tax expense of million for this primarily reflects the loss before taxes for compared to income before taxes for  as well as a depletion accounting income tax benefit of million in liquidity and capital resources at december   the company s available liquidity was million  including cash and cash equivalents of million and million availability under the company s revolving credit facilities 
at december   massey had million outstanding under its credit facilities  which is included in short term debt 
in early may  moody s and s p downgraded our credit ratings 
these ratings actions effectively prevented us from accessing the commercial paper market due to the restrictive investment policy credit guidelines of potential commercial paper investors and caused us to draw on the credit facilities for short term financing needs 
no commercial paper obligations were outstanding at december  on november   massey and its lenders concluded the extension and amendment of the million day and million multi year revolving credit facilities  which have been guaranteed by a 
t 
massey  that serve as the primary source of our short term liquidity 
the credit facilities now provide the lenders with selected assets as collateral for borrowings under the facilities 
the selected assets that are collateral for the credit facilities include all capital stock of the company s subsidiaries and substantially all of the company s assets  now owned or at any time hereafter acquired by the company  excluding among other things  all coal  oil and gas reserves and mining permits  certain properties eg  the eastman chemical company coal handling system and westvaco coal handling facility  and the value of properties that might exceed the lien threshold established in the indenture related to the senior notes discussed below and certain other assets associated with the company s accounts receivable securitization program discussed below 
both facilities have been renewed through november  the company intends to replace these credit facilities prior to their expiration on november  borrowings under these facilities bear interest based on i the london interbank offer rate libor or ii the base rate as defined in the facility agreements plus a margin  which is based on the company s senior secured debt credit rating as determined by moody s and standard poor s 
at december   and currently  massey s senior secured debt ratings are ba and bb  respectively 
the revolving credit facilities contain financial covenants requiring the company to maintain various financial ratios 
failure by the company to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default  which if not cured or waived could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the financial covenants consist of a maximum leverage ratio  a minimum interest coverage ratio  and a minimum net worth test 
the leverage ratio requires that the company not permit the ratio of total indebtedness at the end of any quarter to adjusted ebitda for the four quarters then ended to exceed a specific amount 
the interest coverage ratio requires that the company not permit the ratio of the company s adjusted ebitda to interest expense for the four quarters then ended to be less than a specified amount 
the net worth test requires that the company not permit its net worth to be less than a specified amount 
the company was in compliance with all material covenants at december  and during other periods reflected except for the covenant related to the maximum leverage ratio  with which we were not in compliance at december  however  the participant banks granted a waiver of this financial covenant for the period ended december  in the event we violate any of the debt covenants and do not affect a timely cure or receive a waiver from the lenders in our credit facilities  the debt agreements provide that the administrative agent shall  if requested by at least four lenders holding at least of the aggregate amount of the loans  declare the loans immediately due and payable 
in determining ebitda as defined in the credit facility agreements for use in computing the leverage ratio  the company has excluded certain items  including the million reserve relative to the harman litigation described in note the company believes that the exclusion of such items is appropriate and has notified the lenders administrative agent of this exclusion 
if the accrual for the harman litigation were to be included in the ebitda calculation and no further adjustments were made  the company would still be in compliance with the covenant at december  for further detail on the financial covenants  see section of the amended and restated credit agreement  which is included as exhibit to this form k 
the company had million of long term debt as of december   which consisted entirely of percent senior notes the notes due march  initially  million of the notes were issued in march at a discount  for aggregate proceeds of million 
during the fourth quarter of  the company made several open market purchases  retiring a total principal amount of million senior notes at a cost of million plus accrued interest 
interest is payable semiannually on march and september of each year  commencing september  the notes are redeemable in whole or in part  at the option of the company at any time at a redemption price equal to the greater of i percent of the principal amount of the notes or ii as determined by a quotation agent as defined in the offering prospectus 
on november   moody s and s p reduced the credit ratings on the senior notes to ba and b  respectively  citing the structural subordination caused by the secured status of the amended bank credit facilities 
additionally  the company has available a million debt shelf registration filed with the securities and exchange commission the sec in march  all of which remains unused 
prior to the spin off  fluor corporation filed this debt shelf registration 
an updated filing with the sec would be required to issue debt under this shelf registration 
in december  the company generated cash flow of million from the sale and leaseback of mining equipment 
in january  the company implemented an accounts receivable securitization program that will allow it to generate cash of up to million based on the amount of accounts receivable outstanding 
the cash generated from both the sale leaseback and securitization programs will reduce capacity under the company s main credit facility by of the proceeds 
the total debt to book capitalization ratio was percent at december  compared to percent at october  the cash flow provided by operating activities was million in and million for the fiscal year ended october  cash provided by operating activities reflects net earnings adjusted for non cash charges and changes in working capital requirements 
net cash utilized in investing activities was million in and million for the fiscal year ended october  the cash used in investing activities reflects capital expenditures in the amount of million and million in the years ended december  and october   respectively 
these capital expenditures are for replacement of mining equipment  the expansion of mining capacity and projects to improve the efficiency of mining operations 
net cash utilized in financing activities was million in compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million in financing activities in primarily reflect changes in amounts due from fluor corporation and other capital accounts associated with the spin off transaction and being a publicly traded company 
in addition  the net cash utilized in financing activities in also includes million of proceeds from a sale leaseback transaction  as well as million utilized to repurchase a portion of our outstanding senior notes 
in addition to the cash spent on capital expenditures during the year of  the company leased  through operating leases  million and million of mining equipment in and the fiscal year ended october   respectively 
the cash flow provided by operating activities was million in and million for the same period in cash provided by operating activities reflects net earnings adjusted for non cash charges and changes in working capital requirements 
net cash utilized in investing activities was million in  and million in the cash used in investing activities reflects capital expenditures in the amount of million and million for the years ended october  and  respectively 
these capital expenditures are for replacement of mining equipment  the expansion of mining capacity and projects to improve the efficiency of mining operations 
financing activities primarily reflect changes in amounts due from fluor corporation and other capital accounts associated with the spin off transaction and being a publicly traded company 
in addition to the cash spent on capital expenditures during the year of  the company leased  through operating leases  million and million of mining equipment in and  respectively 
massey believes that cash generated from operations and its borrowing capacity will be sufficient to meet its working capital requirements  anticipated capital expenditures other than major acquisitions  scheduled debt payments and anticipated dividend payments for at least the next several years 
nevertheless  the ability of massey to satisfy its debt service obligations  to fund planned capital expenditures or pay dividends will depend upon its future operating performance  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in the coal industry and financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond massey s control 
massey frequently evaluates potential acquisitions 
in the past  massey has funded acquisitions primarily with cash generated from operations  but massey may consider a variety of other sources  depending on the size of any transaction  including debt or equity financing 
there can be no assurance that such additional capital resources will be available to massey on terms which massey finds acceptable  or at all 
the following is a summary of our significant obligations as of december  payments due by years in thousands total within after year years years years long term debt   short term debt   operating lease obligations      total obligations      additionally  we have liabilities relating to other post employment benefits  work related injuries and illnesses  and mine reclamation and closure 
as of december   payments related to these items are estimated to be payments due by years in thousands within year years years our determination of these noncurrent liabilities is calculated annually and is based on several assumptions  including then prevailing conditions  which may change from year to year 
in any year  if our assumptions are inaccurate  we could be required to expend greater amounts than anticipated 
moreover  in particular for periods after  our estimates may change from the amounts included in the table  and may change significantly  if our assumptions change to reflect changing conditions 
these assumptions are discussed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements and in the critical accounting estimates and assumptions of the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation section 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  the company is a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements including guarantees  indemnifications  and financial instruments with off balance sheet risk  such as bank letters of credit and performance or surety bonds 
liabilities related to these arrangements are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets  and we do not expect any material adverse effects on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows to result from these off balance sheet arrangements 
the company uses surety bonds to secure reclamation  workers compensation  wage payments  and other miscellaneous obligations 
as of december   the company had million of outstanding surety bonds with third parties 
these bonds were in place to secure obligations as follows post mining reclamation bonds of million  workers compensation bonds of million  wage payment and collection bonds of million  and other miscellaneous obligation bonds of million 
recently  surety bond costs have increased  while the market terms of surety bonds have generally become less favorable 
to the extent that surety bonds become unavailable  the company would seek to secure obligations with letters of credit  cash deposits  or other suitable forms of collateral 
from time to time the company uses bank letters of credit to secure its obligations for worker s compensation programs  various insurance contracts and other obligations 
issuing banks currently require that such letters of credit be secured by funds deposited into restricted accounts pledged to the banks under reimbursement agreements 
at december   the company had million of letters of credit outstanding  collateralized by million of cash deposited in restricted  interest bearing accounts  and no claims were outstanding against those letters of credit 
inflation inflation in the united states has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on massey s cash flows  financial position or results of operations for the years presented 
recent accounting pronouncements on august   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 

the standard requires the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation to be recognized in the period in which it is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  the offset is capitalized by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
to settle the liability  the obligation is paid  and to the extent there is a difference between the liability and the amount of cash paid  a gain or loss upon settlement is incurred 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  and transition is by cumulative catch up adjustment 
the company has adopted sfas no 
on january  and the adoption will change the company s current accounting for reclamation 
the company is continuing to calculate its transition adjustment 
in april  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections sfas no 
 which is effective for fiscal years beginning after may the standard requires that gains or losses on debt extinguishment  previously reported as extraordinary items  be presented as a component of results from continuing operations unless the extinguishment meets the criteria for classification as an extraordinary item in accounting principles board opinion no 
during the fourth quarter of  the company purchased in open market transactions  an aggregate of million of its percent senior notes at an aggregate purchase price of million 
the company has chosen early adoption of sfas no 
 and accordingly  recorded a gain on the transactions in senior notes repurchase income  a component of total revenue 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantors accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
this interpretation describes the disclosure requirements of a guarantor s issuance of certain guarantees  and clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize a liability  at the date of issuance  for the fair value of the obligation assumed in issuing the guarantee 
the disclosure requirements of fin are effective for the company for the year ended december   and the initial recognition and measurement provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
outlook cold winter weather  reductions in utility coal stockpiles and the rising costs of alternative energy sources  are expected to accelerate demand for coal in early supply constraint and production declines by producers throughout central appalachia should also support coal prices 
nevertheless  the company expects a loss in the first quarter of due to operational disruptions caused by moving four longwalls to new panels and weather related production and shipping issues 
the company currently projects produced coal sales of to million tons in critical accounting estimates and assumptions the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts 
these estimates and assumptions are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements 
the following critical accounting estimates and assumptions were used in the preparation of the financial statements defined benefit pension the company has noncontributory defined benefit pension plans  which cover substantially all administrative and non union employees of the company 
benefits are generally based on the employee s years of service and compensation  or under a cash balance formula with contribution credits based on hours worked 
funding for the plan is generally at the minimum annual contribution level required by applicable regulations 
the company accounts for its defined benefit plans in accordance with fas  employer s accounting for pensions  which requires amounts recognized in the financial statements to be determined on an actuarial basis 
the estimated cost and benefits of our non contributory defined benefit pension plans are determined by independent actuaries  who  with our input  use various actuarial assumptions  including discount rate  future rate of increase in compensation levels and expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets 
the discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date 
in estimating the discount rate  we look to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
at december   the discount rate was determined to be compared to the discount rate at october  of 
the rate of increase in compensation levels is determined based upon the company s long term plans for such increases 
the rate of increase in compensation levels was determined to be at december   and october  expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on long term historical return information for the mix of investments that comprise plan assets and future estimates of long term investment returns 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets used to determine expense in each period was and for the years ended december  and october   respectively 
the company expects to adjust the expected long term rate of return on plan assets to for determination of expense 
significant changes to these rates introduce substantial volatility to our costs 
the fair value of the defined benefit pension plan assets is an important factor in the determination of defined benefit pension expense 
the fair value of plan assets at december  was million compared to million at october   a reduction of million 
as a result of the decrease in discount rate  the reduction in expected long term rate of return on plan assets  and the decline in defined benefit pension plan assets during  costs for the defined benefit pension plans are expected to increase in compared to related expense 
coal workers pneumoconiosis we are responsible under the federal coal mine health and safety act of  as amended  and various states statutes  for the payment of medical and disability benefits to eligible recipients resulting from occurrences of coal workers pneumoconiosis disease black lung 
after review and consultation with us  an annual evaluation is prepared by our independent actuaries based on assumptions regarding disability incidence  medical costs  mortality  death benefits  dependents and interest rates 
the company records expense related to this obligation using the service cost method 
the discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date 
at december   the discount rate was determined to be compared to the discount rate at october   of 
significant changes to these interest rates introduce substantial volatility to our costs 
in january  the united states department of labor amended the regulations implementing the federal black lung laws to give greater weight to the opinion of a claimant s treating physician  expand the definition of black lung disease and limit the amount of medical evidence that can be submitted by claimants and respondents 
the amendments also alter administrative procedures for the adjudication of claims  which according to the department of labor  results in streamlined procedures that are less formal  less adversarial and easier for participants to understand 
these and other changes to the federal black lung regulations could result in changes in assumptions used in our actuarial determination of the liability  including interest  disability and mortality assumptions 
these changes could potentially increase our exposure to black lung benefits liabilities 
workers compensation workers compensation is a system by which individuals who sustain physical or mental injuries due to their jobs are compensated for their disabilities  medical costs  and on some occasions  for the costs of their rehabilitation  and by which the survivors of workers who suffer work related deaths receive compensation for lost financial support 
the workers compensation laws are administered by state agencies with each state having its own set of rules and regulations regarding compensation that is owed to an employee that is injured in the course of employment 
our operations are covered by a combination of either a self insurance program  as a participant in a state run program  or by an insurance policy 
we accrue for the self insured liability by recognizing cost when it is probable that the liability has been incurred and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
to assist in the determination of this estimated liability we utilize the services of third party administrators 
these third parties provide information to independent actuaries  who after review and consultation with us with regards to actuarial rate assumptions  including discount rate  prepare an evaluation of the self insured program liabilities 
actual losses could differ from these estimates  which could increase our costs 
other post employment benefits our sponsored defined benefit health care plans provide retiree health benefits to eligible union and non union retirees who have met certain age and service requirements 
depending on year of retirement  benefits may be subject to annual deductibles  coinsurance requirements  lifetime limits  and retiree contributions 
these plans are not funded 
costs are paid as incurred by participants 
the estimated cost and benefits of our retiree health care plans are determined by independent actuaries  who  with our input  use various actuarial assumptions  including discount rate  expected trend in health care costs and per capita costs 
the discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date 
the discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the other post employment benefit liabilities could be effectively settled at the measurement date 
in estimating this rate  we look to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized ratings agency 
at december   the discount rate was determined to be compared to the discount rate at october  of 
significant changes to these interest rates introduce substantial volatility to our costs 
at december  our assumptions of our company health care cost trend were projected at an annual rate of ranging down to by  and remaining level thereafter  compared to the health care cost trend rate of ranging down to by used at december  if the actual increase in the cost of medical services or other post retirements benefits are significantly greater or less than the projected trend rates  the cost assumptions would need to be adjusted which could have a significant effect on the costs and liabilities recognized in the financial statements 
as a result of the reduction in discount rate discussed above and the increase in health care cost trend rate  absent any plan changes  costs for the retiree health benefits plans are expected to increase in compared to related expense 
reclamation and mine closure obligations the surface mining control and reclamation act establishes operational  reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining as well as most aspects of deep mining 
estimates of our total reclamation and mine closing liabilities are based upon permit requirements and our engineering expertise related to these requirements 
we accrue for the costs of current mine disturbance and final mine closure  including the cost of treating mine water discharge as coal is mined  on a unit of production basis over the proven and probable reserves as defined in industry guide the estimate of ultimate reclamation liability is reviewed annually by our management and engineers 
the estimated liability can change significantly if actual costs vary from assumptions or if governmental regulations change significantly 
accounting pronouncement  sfas no 
requires that retirement obligations be recorded as a liability based on the present value of the estimated cash flows 
further discussion of the implementation of this new accounting pronouncement can be found in the previous section new accounting pronouncements 
contingencies we are the subject of  or a party to  various suits and pending or threatened litigation involving governmental agencies or private interests 
we have accrued the probable and reasonably estimable costs for the resolution of these claims based upon management s best estimate of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
unless otherwise noted  management does not believe that the outcome or timing of current legal or environmental matters will have a material impact to its results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
also  our operations are affected by federal  state and local laws and regulations regarding environmental matters and other aspects of our business 
the impact  if any  of pending legislation or regulatory developments on future operations is not currently estimable 
deferred taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for income taxes which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
at december   we had deferred tax liabilities in excess of deferred tax assets of approximately million 
the deferred tax assets are evaluated annually to determine if a valuation allowance is necessary 
as of december   we had recorded a valuation allowance of approximately million  primarily related to alternative minimum tax credits 
at december  the company believes that it is more likely than not that the net balance of deferred tax assets will be realized 
coal reserve values there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of economically recoverable coal reserves 
many of these uncertainties are beyond our control 
as a result  estimates of economically recoverable coal reserves are by their nature uncertain 
information about our reserves consists of estimates based on engineering  economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by our staff 
some of the factors and assumptions that impact economically recoverable reserve estimates include geological conditions  historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effects of regulations and taxes by governmental agencies  assumptions governing future prices  and future operating costs 
each of these factors may in fact vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating reserves 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of coal attributable to a particular group of properties  and classifications of these reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows  may vary substantially 
actual production  revenue and expenditures with respect to reserves will likely vary from estimates  and these variances may be material 
capitalized development costs development costs applicable to the opening of new coal mines and certain mine expansion projects are capitalized and reported in property  plant and equipment 
pursuant to sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the continuing economic viability of capitalized development costs are assessed when the indicators of impairment exist 
this assessment includes a consideration of the future operating cashflows as measured using various potential operating plans and market assumptions of future coal demand and prices 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative discussions about market risk our interest expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in the united states 
at december   we had outstanding million aggregate principal amount of long term debt under fixed rate instruments  however  our primary exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to our short term financing 
at december   we had million outstanding under the revolving credit facilities 
at december   the weighted average interest rate of borrowings under the credit facilities was percent 
based on the short term debt balance outstanding at december   a basis point increase in the average interest rate for our borrowings would increase our annual interest expense by approximately million 
almost all of massey s transactions are denominated in us dollars  and  as a result  it does not have material exposure to currency exchange rate risks 
we manage our commodity price risk through the use of long term coal supply agreements  which are contracts with a term of greater than months  rather than through the use of derivative instruments 
for our fiscal year ended december   approximately of our coal sales volume was pursuant to long term contracts 
the company anticipates that in  the percentage of sales pursuant to long term arrangements will be comparable with the percentage of sales for the prices for coal shipped under long term contracts may be below the current market price for similar types of coal at any given time 
as a consequence of the substantial volume of its sales which are subject to these long term agreements  the company has less coal available with which to capitalize on stronger coal prices if and when they arise 
in addition  because long term contracts typically allow the customer to elect volume flexibility  the company s ability to realize the higher prices that may be available in the spot market may be restricted when customers elect to purchase higher volumes under such contracts  or the company s exposure to market based pricing may be increased should customers elect to purchase fewer tons
