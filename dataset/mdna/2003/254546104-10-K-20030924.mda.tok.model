effect of new accounting standards in october  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 impairment on disposal of long lived assets  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  under sfas no 
 the criteria required for classifying an asset as held for sale have been significantly changed 
assets held for sale are stated at the lower of their fair 
table of contents values or carrying amounts  and depreciation is no longer recognized 
in addition  the expected future operating losses from discontinued operations will be displayed in discontinued operations in the period in which the losses are incurred rather than as of the measurement date 
more dispositions will qualify for discontinued operations treatment in the income statement under the new rules 
the company has determined that adoption of this standard had no material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years ending after december  the company has adopted the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
for the quarterly period beginning on january  the company does not expect to adopt the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation  and therefore  adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have an impact on the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
the interpretation elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees  including loan guarantees such as standby letters of credit 
it also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee  the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value  or market value  of the obligations it assumes under the guarantee and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements 
the provisions related to recognizing a liability at inception of the guarantee for the fair value of the guarantor s obligations does not apply to product warranties or to guarantees accounted for as derivatives 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin is effective immediately for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provision of fin must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  the adoption of fin to date has not had any impact on our consolidated financial statements

critical accounting policies and estimates summary the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the company evaluates its estimates on an on going basis  including those related to product returns and allowances  bad debts  inventory valuation  goodwill and intangible assets  income taxes  warranty and installation provisions  and contingencies 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition policy we derive revenue from the sale of products and from services rendered to our customers  including installation  training and maintenance 
generally  our products contain embedded software that is essential to their functionality 
we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
and statement of position  software revenue recognition  sop  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the price is fixed or determinable  collection is probable and vendor specific objective evidence exists to allocate revenue to the various elements of the arrangement 
vendor specific objective evidence is based on the price charged when an element is sold separately or  if not yet sold separately  when the price is established by authorized management 
delivery is generally considered to have occurred when shipped 
we sell our equipment through our direct sales force and through distributors and resellers 
sales through distributors and resellers are recognized as revenue upon sale to the distributor or reseller as these sales are considered to be final and no right of return or price protection exists 
customer acceptance is generally limited to performance under our published product specifications 
when additional customer acceptance conditions apply  all revenue related to the sale is deferred until acceptance is obtained 
our equipment typically includes a one year 
table of contents warranty 
the estimated cost of product warranty claims is accrued at the time the sale is recognized  based on historical experience 
installation and training services are not considered to be essential to the functionality of our products  and revenue related to these items is recognized when the services are completed 
we recognize maintenance fees ratably over the period of the related maintenance contract 
maintenance consists of product repair services  unspecified software upgrades and telephone support 
loss provisions on accounts receivable and inventory we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we assess collectibility based on a number of factors including  but not limited to  past transaction history with the customer  the credit worthiness of the customer  independent credit reports  industry trends and the macro economic environment 
sales returns and allowances are estimates of future product returns related to current period revenue 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period 
historically  we have not experienced significant sales returns or bad debt losses 
we value our inventory at the lower of standard cost which approximates costs on a first in  first out basis or market 
we estimate revisions to inventory valuations based on technical obsolescence  historical demand  projections of future demand and industry and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional valuation provisions may be required 
if demand or market conditions are more favorable than projected  high margins could be realized to the extent inventory is sold which had previously been written down 
long lived assets  intangible assets with finite lives and goodwill we assess the impairment of long lived assets  intangible assets with finite lives and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in addition  we assess goodwill for impairment at least annually 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry or economic trends  and significant changes or developments in strategic technology 
when we determine that the carrying value of long lived assets and intangible assets with finite lives may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above or other indicators  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the fair values of related reporting units to their carrying values 
as of july   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
and as a result  we ceased to amortize approximately million of goodwill at june  in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an impairment review at least annually 
warranty product warranties are recorded at the time revenue is recognized for certain product shipments based on historical experience 
while the company 
table of contents engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service costs differ from our previous estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
taxes on income as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation  amortization and inventory reserves  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  we may need to revise the valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and stock prices of marketable equity securities 
with the exception of the stock price volatility of our marketable equity securities  we manage our exposure to these and other risks through our regular operating and financing activities and  when appropriate  through our hedging activities 
our policy is not to use hedges or other derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
we deal with a diversified group of major financial institutions to limit the risk of nonperformance by any one institution on any financial instrument 
separate from our financial hedging activities  material changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates and  to a lesser extent  commodity prices could cause significant changes in the costs to manufacture and deliver our products and in our customers buying practices 
we have not substantially changed our risk management practices during fiscal and do not currently anticipate significant changes in financial market risk exposures in the near future that would require us to change our risk management practices 
foreign currency exchange revenues generated from international operations are generally denominated in foreign currencies 
we enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge against fluctuations of intercompany account balances 
market value gains and losses on these hedge contracts are substantially offset by fluctuations in the underlying balances being hedged  and the net financial impact is not expected to be material in future periods 
at june   the company had forward exchange contracts to sell foreign currencies totaling million dollars  including approximately million in euros  million in japanese yen and  in canadian dollars 
at june   the company had forward exchange contracts to sell foreign currencies totaling million dollars  including approximately million in euros  million in japanese yen   in british pounds   in swiss francs and  in canadian dollars 
the foreign exchange contracts at the end of each fiscal year mature within the first quarter of the following fiscal year 
additionally  contract values and fair market values are the same 
a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical movement in foreign currency exchange rates applied to our hedging contracts and underlying balances being hedged at june  and  
table of contents indicated that these market movements would not have a material effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
foreign currency rate fluctuations can impact the us dollar translation of our foreign operations in our consolidated financial statements 
currency fluctuations increased reported sales by in fiscal and decreased reported sales by and in fiscal and  respectively 
interest and investment income our interest and investment income is subject to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash equivalents and short term investments 
a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical movement in interest rates applied to our investment balances at june  and  indicated that such market movement would not have a material effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
actual gains or losses in the future may differ materially from this analysis  depending on our actual balances and changes in the timing and amount of interest rate movements 
marketable equity securities we are exposed to market price risks on our marketable equity securities 
these investments are in publicly traded companies in the laboratory analytical instruments sector 
we do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure on these securities 
a adverse change in the equity price would result in an approximate  and million decrease in the fair value of our marketable equity securities as of june  and  respectively 
debt and interest expense a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical movement in interest rates applied to our outstanding debt balance at june  and  indicated that such market movement would not have a material effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
actual gains or losses in the future may differ materially from this analysis  depending on changes in the timing and amount of interest rate movements
