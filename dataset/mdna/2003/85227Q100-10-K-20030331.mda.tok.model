item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are summarized in note to its consolidated financial statements 
however  certain of the company s accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by its management  and such judgments are reflected in the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements 
in applying these policies  the company s management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of estimates 
those estimates are based on the company s historical experience  terms of existing contracts  management s observation of trends in the industry  information provided by its clients  and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
actual results may differ significantly from the estimates contained in the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company s significant accounting policies include revenue recognition 
the company s revenues consist primarily of software license revenues  maintenance revenues  and professional and outsourcing services revenues 
the company applies the provisions of statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition sop to all software transactions 
the company recognizes revenues from the sale of software licenses when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
the company s products generally do not require significant modification or customization of software 
installation of the products is generally routine and is not essential to the functionality of the product 
the company uses a signed license agreement as evidence of an arrangement for the majority of its transactions 
certain products are sold with a shrink wrapped license and under those arrangements 
delivery occurs when the product is delivered to a common carrier fob shipping point 
the arrangements generally do not have acceptance provisions  if they are included in the arrangement  then delivery occurs at acceptance 
at the time of the transaction  the company assesses whether the fee is fixed and determinable based on the payment terms 
collection is assessed based on several factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
the arrangements for software licenses are sold with maintenance and generally with professional services 
the company allocates revenue to the delivered components  normally the license component  using the residual value method based on objective evidence of the fair value of the undelivered elements 
the total contract value is attributed first to the maintenance and support arrangement based on the fair value  equal to its stated list price as a fixed percentage of the software price 
fair value of the professional services is based on upon separate sales of those services 
professional services are generally billed at an hourly rate plus travel related expenses 
professional services revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
maintenance revenue is recognized ratable over the term of the contract 
outsourcing services revenues  which are based on a monthly fee or transaction based are recognized as the services are performed 
the company occasionally enters into software license agreements requiring significant customization 
the company accounts for these agreements on the percentage of completion method based on the ratio of hours incurred to expected total hours  accordingly the company must estimate the costs to complete the agreement utilizing an estimate of development man hours remaining 
due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process  it is at least reasonably possible that completion costs may be revised 
such revisions are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
due to the complexity of some software license agreements  the company routinely applies judgments to the application of software recognition accounting principles to specific agreements and transactions 
different judgments and or different contract structures could have led to different accounting conclusions  which could have a material effect on the company s reported quarterly results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the preparation of financial statements requires the company s management to make estimates relating to the collectibility of its accounts receivable 
management establishes the allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical bad debt experience 
in addition  management analyzes customer accounts  client concentrations  client credit worthiness  current economic trends  and changes in the company s client payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
such estimates require significant judgment on the part of the company s management 
therefore  changes in the assumptions underlying the company s estimates or changes in the financial condition of the company s customers could result in a different required allowance  which could have a material impact on the company s reported results of operations 
long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill 
the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets in the first fiscal quarter of sfas supercedes accounting principles board opinion no 
intangible assets and discontinues the amortization of goodwill 
sfas primarily addresses the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to their initial recognition 
the provisions of sfas prohibit the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  require that goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles assets be tested annually for impairment and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value of goodwill and or indefinite lived intangible assets may be impaired  require that reporting units be identified for the purpose of assessing potential future impairments of goodwill  and remove the forty year limitation on the amortization period of intangible assets that have finite lives 
the company assesses the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of potential impairment  we assess whether an impairment has occurred based on whether net book value of the assets exceeds related projected undiscounted cash flows from these assets  considering a number of factors including past operating results  budgets  economic projections  market trends and product development cycles 
acquisition accounting 
in january  the company acquired real time usa  inc for total consideration of million  net of cash acquired  which was allocated to net tangible assets acquired of million  completed technology of million and in process r d of million 
in november  we acquired dbc for total consideration of million  which was allocated to net liabilities acquired of million  completed technology of million and goodwill of million 
the fair value of the completed technology was determined based on the discounted estimated future cash flows from the sale of the completed technology 
actual results during the year ended december  were consistent with our estimated cash flows 
we estimated that the useful life of the acquired technology would be five years 
significant judgments and estimates are involved in determining the fair market value of assets acquired and their useful lives 
different assumptions could yield materially different results 
income taxes 
the carrying value of the company s net deferred tax assets assumes that the company will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record additional valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
the company evaluates whether deferred tax assets are realizable quarterly and assesses whether there is a need for additional valuation allowances quarterly 
such estimates require significant judgment on the part of the company s management 
in addition  the company evaluates the need to provide additional tax provisions for adjustments proposed by taxing authorities 
marketable securities 
the company classifies its entire investment portfolio  consisting of debt securities issued by federal government agencies  debt securities issued by state and local governments of the united states  debt securities issued by corporations and equities  as available for sale securities 
carrying amounts approximate fair value  as estimated based on market prices and any unrealized gain or loss is recognized in stockholder s equity 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin sab  accounting for noncurrent marketable equity securities  provide guidance on determining when an investment is other than temporarily impaired 
in making this judgment  the company s management evaluates  among other factors  the duration and extent to which the fair value of the investment is less than its cost and the financial health of and the business outlook for the investee  including factors in the industry and financing cash flows 
if management s assessments are incorrect  the company s working capital could be adversely affected

recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
nullifies the guidance of the emerging issues task force eitf in eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
under eitf issue no 
 an entity recognized a liability for an exit cost on the date that the entity committed itself to an exit plan 
in sfas no 
 the fasb acknowledges that an entity s commitment to a plan does not  by itself  create a present obligation to the other parties that meets the definition of a liability and requires that a liability for a cost that is associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
it also establishes that fair value is the objective for the initial measurement of the liability 
sfas will be effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  we do not expect a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations for the adoption of sfas in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires that a liability be recorded in the guarantor s balance sheet upon issuance of a guarantee 
in addition  fin requires disclosure about the guarantees that an entity has issued  including a reconciliation of changes in the entity s product warranty liabilities 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of fin are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements of fin are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  our software license agreements typically indemnify our clients for intellectual property infringement claims 
we also warrant to our clients that our software operates substantially in accordance with our specifications 
we believe that the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
however  we continue to evaluate the impact of fin on our financial statements and related disclosures 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation costs transition and disclosure 
this statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and provides alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation 
it also requires additional disclosures about the effects on reported net income of an entity s accounting policy with respect to stock based employee compensation 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and have adopted the disclosure only alternative of sfas no 
we adopted the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
in december certain factors that may affect future operating results fluctuations in quarterly performance 
historically  the company s revenues and operating results have fluctuated substantially from quarter to quarter 
the company s quarterly operating results may continue to fluctuate due to a number of factors  including the timing  size and nature of the company s individual license transactions  the timing of the introduction and the market acceptance of new products or product enhancements by the company or its competitors  the relative proportions of revenues derived from license fees  maintenance  consulting  and other recurring revenues and professional services  changes in the company s operating expenses  changes in the company s personnel  and fluctuations in economic and financial market conditions 
the timing  size  and nature of individual license transactions are important factors in the company s quarterly operating results 
many such license transactions involve large dollar amounts  and the sales cycles for these transactions are often lengthy and unpredictable 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in closing large license transactions on a timely basis or at all 
dependence on the financial services industry 
the company s clients include a range of organizations in the financial services industry 
the success of these clients is intrinsically linked to the health of the financial markets 
in addition  because of the capital expenditures required in connection with an investment in the company s products  the company believes that demand for its products could be disproportionately affected by fluctuations  disruptions  instability  or downturns in the financial markets  which may cause clients and potential clients to exit the industry or delay  cancel  or reduce any planned expenditures for investment management systems and software products 
any resulting decline in demand for the company s products could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
integration of operations 
the company s success is dependent in part on its ability to complete the integration of the operations of recently acquired businesses  including dbc  real time and digital visions  in an efficient and effective manner 
successful integration in the rapidly changing financial services industry may be more difficult to accomplish than in other industries 
the combination of these acquired businesses will require  among other things  integration of product offerings and coordination of sales and marketing and research and development efforts 
there can be no assurance that such integration will be accomplished smoothly or successfully 
the difficulties of integration may be increased by the necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations 
the integration of certain operations will require the dedication of management resources that may temporarily distract attention from the day to day business of the company 
the inability of management to successfully integrate the operations of acquired companies could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
product concentration 
to date  substantially all of the company s revenues have been attributable to the licensing and outsourcing of its camra  advisorware  skyline  and lms software and the provision of maintenance and consulting services in support of such software 
the company expects that the revenue from these software products will continue to account for a significant portion of its total revenues for the foreseeable future 
as a result  factors adversely affecting the pricing of or demand for such products and services  such as competition or technological change  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
competition 
the market for financial service software is competitive  rapidly evolving and highly sensitive to new product introductions and marketing efforts by industry participants 
the company believes the principal competitive factors in its industry include consistent product performance  broad functionality  ease of use  scalability  integration capabilities  product and company reputation  client service and support  and price 
although the company believes it currently competes effectively with respect to these factors  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its competitive position against current and potential competitors 
ss c believes none of its competitors currently compete against it in all of its target industry segments  although there can be no assurance that one or more may not compete against the company in the future in additional industry segments 
many of the company s current and potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  and marketing resources  generate higher revenues  and have greater name recognition 
there can be no assurance that the company s current or potential competitors will not develop products comparable or superior to those developed by the company  or adapt more quickly than the company to new technologies  evolving industry trends  or changing client requirements 
it is also possible that alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced gross margins  and loss of market share  any of which would materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
rapid technological change 
the market for the company s products and services is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and new product introductions 
the company s future success will depend in part upon its ability to enhance its existing products and services and to develop and introduce new products and services to meet changing client needs 
the process of developing software products such as those offered by the company is extremely complex and is expected to become increasingly complex and expensive in the future due to the introduction of new platforms and technologies 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully complete the development of new products in a timely fashion or that the company s current or future products will satisfy the needs of the financial markets 
dependence on proprietary technology 
the company s success and ability to compete depends in part upon its ability to protect its proprietary technology 
the company relies on a combination of trade secret  copyright  and trademark law  nondisclosure agreements and technical measures to protect its proprietary technology 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to protect its proprietary technology will be adequate to prevent misappropriation or independent third party development of such technology 
product defects and product liability 
the company s software products are highly complex and sophisticated and could contain design defects or software errors that are difficult to detect and correct 
errors  bugs or viruses may result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of the company s software products or loss of client data 
although the company has not experienced material adverse effects resulting from any software defects or errors  there can be no assurance that  despite testing by the company and its clients  errors will not be found in new products  which errors could result in a delay in or an inability to achieve market acceptance and thus could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
key personnel 
the company s success is dependent in part upon its ability to attract  train and retain highly skilled technical  managerial  and sales personnel 
the loss of services of one or more of the company s key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
competition for the hiring of such personnel in the software industry is intense 
locating candidates with the appropriate qualifications  particularly in the desired geographic location  is difficult 
although the company expects to continue to attract and retain sufficient numbers of highly skilled employees for the foreseeable future  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so 
risks associated with international operations 
the company has risks associated with its foreign operations 
an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make the company s products more expensive and  therefore  potentially less competitive in those foreign markets 
a portion of the company s international sales is denominated in foreign currency  and the company occasionally hedges some of the risk associated with foreign exchange fluctuations 
although the company believes its foreign currency exchange rate risk is minimal  significant fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies could have a material adverse effect on the earnings of the company 
in addition  the company s international business may be subject to a variety of other risks  including difficulties in obtaining us export licenses  potentially longer payment cycles  increased costs associated with maintaining international marketing efforts  the introduction of non tariff barriers and higher duty rates  and difficulties in enforcement of third party contractual obligations and intellectual property rights 
there can be no assurance that such factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  or results of operations 
because of these and other factors  past financial performance should not be considered an indication of future performance 
the company s quarterly operating results may vary significantly  depending on factors such as the timing  size  and nature of licensing transactions and new product introductions by the company or its competitors 
investors should not use historical trends to anticipate future results and should be aware that the trading price of the company s common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in operating results and other factors  including those discussed above 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has no derivative financial instruments 
the company generally places its marketable security investments in high credit quality instruments  primarily us government and federal agency obligations  tax exempt municipal obligations and corporate obligations 
the company does not expect any material loss from its marketable security investments and therefore believes that its potential interest rate exposure is not material 
the following table provides information about the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates dollars in thousands fair value of investments as of december  maturing in through investments fixed rate investments    average interest the company invoices customers primarily in us dollars and in local currency in those countries in which the company has branch and subsidiary operations 
the company is exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations from the time customers are invoiced in local currency until collection occurs 
through december   foreign currency fluctuations have not had a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations  and therefore the company believes that its potential foreign currency exchange rate exposure is not material 
the foregoing risk management discussion and the effect thereof are forward looking statements 
actual results in the future may differ materially from these projected results due to actual developments in global financial markets 
the analytical methods used by the company to assess and minimize risk discussed above should not be considered projections of future events or losses
