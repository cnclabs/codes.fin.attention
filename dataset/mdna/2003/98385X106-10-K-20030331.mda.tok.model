item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  regarding recent price fluctuations and their effect on our results 
business strategy the primary components of our business strategy are acquiring long lived  operated oil and gas properties  increasing production and reserves through aggressive management of operations and through development  exploitation and exploration activities  hedging a portion of our production to stabilize cash flow and protect the return on development projects  and retaining management and technical staff that have substantial experience in the company s core areas 
acquiring long lived  operated properties 
we seek to acquire long lived  operated producing properties that contain complex multiple producing horizons with the potential for increases in reserves and production  are in core operating areas or in areas with similar geologic and reservoir characteristics  and present opportunities to reduce expenses per mcfe through more efficient operations 
we believe that the properties we acquire provide opportunities to increase production and reserves through the implementation of mechanical and operational improvements  workovers  behind pipe completions  secondary recovery operations  new development wells and other development activities 
we also seek to acquire facilities related to gathering  processing  marketing and transporting oil and gas in areas where we own reserves 
such facilities can enhance profitability  reduce costs  and provide marketing flexibility and access to additional markets 
the ability to successfully purchase properties is dependent upon  among other things  competition for such purchases and the availability of financing to supplement internally generated cash flow 
increasing production and reserves 
a principal component of our strategy is to increase production and reserves through aggressive management of operations and low risk development 
we believe that our principal properties possess geologic and reservoir characteristics that make them well suited for production increases through drilling and other development programs 
we have generated an inventory of approximately  potential drilling locations 
additionally  we review operations and mechanical data on operated properties to determine if actions can be taken to reduce operating costs or increase production 
such actions include installing  repairing and upgrading lifting equipment  redesigning downhole equipment to improve production from different zones  modifying gathering and other surface facilities and conducting restimulations and recompletions 
we may also initiate  upgrade or revise existing secondary recovery operations 

table of contents exploration activities 
during  we plan to focus our exploration activities on projects that are near currently owned productive fields 
we believe that we can prudently and successfully add growth potential through exploratory activities given improved technology  our experienced technical staff and our expanded base of operations 
we have allocated approximately million of our million development budget for exploration activities 
hedging activities 
we enter futures contracts  collars and basis swap agreements  as well as fixed price physical delivery contracts 
our policy is to routinely hedge a portion of our production at commodity prices management deems attractive 
while there is a risk we may not be able to realize the benefit of rising prices  management plans to continue its hedging strategy because of the benefits provided by predictable  stable cash flow  including ability to more efficiently plan and execute our development program  which facilitates predictable production growth  ability to enter long term arrangements with drilling contractors  allowing us to continue development projects when product prices decline  more consistent returns on investment  and better utilization of our personnel 
experienced management and technical staff 
most senior management and technical staff have worked together for over years and have substantial experience in our core operating areas

simpson and steffen e 
palko  co founders of the company  were previously executive officers of southland royalty company  one of the largest us independent oil and gas producers prior to its acquisition by burlington northern  inc in other strategies 
we may also acquire working interests in producing properties that we will not operate if such interests otherwise meet our acquisition criteria 
we attempt to acquire nonoperated interests in fields where the operators have a significant interest to protect  including potential undeveloped reserves that will be exploited by the operator 
we may also acquire nonoperated interests in order to ultimately accumulate sufficient ownership interests to operate the properties 
we also attempt to acquire a portion of our reserves as royalty interests 
royalty interests have few operational liabilities because they do not participate in operating activities and do not bear production or development costs 
royalty trusts 
we have created and sold units in publicly traded royalty trusts 
sales of royalty trust units allow us to more efficiently capitalize our mature  lower growth properties 
we may create and sell interests in additional royalty trusts in the future 
business goals 
in december  we announced our strategic goals for of increasing gas production by over levels and increasing all production  including oil and natural gas liquids  by approximately on an mcfe basis 
to achieve these growth targets  we plan to drill about net development wells and perform approximately net workovers and recompletions in approximately of these planned wells are classified as proved undeveloped reserves on our current reserve report 
we have budgeted million for our drilling programs  which is expected to be funded by cash flow from operations 
we plan to spend about of the development budget in east texas and about in aggregate in the arkoma and san juan basins  and the balance evenly allocated to alaska  permian basin and hugoton royalty trust properties 
exploration expenditures are expected to be approximately of the budget 
costs of strategic property acquisitions during may reduce the amount currently budgeted for development and exploration 
we may reevaluate our budget and drilling programs in the event of significant changes in oil and gas prices to focus on opportunities offering the highest rates of return and may increase our budget 
our ability to achieve these production and proved reserves goals will depend on the success of these planned drilling programs or  if property acquisitions are made in place of a portion of the drilling program  the success of those acquisitions 

table of contents acquisitions during  we acquired producing properties for a total cost of million 
the east texas basin acquisition was the largest of these acquisitions 
the purchase closed in april at a price of million  which was reduced to million by a million production payment sold to eex corporation 
in september  we acquired oil producing properties in the middle ground shoal field of alaska s cook inlet in exchange for million shares of our common stock along with certain price guarantees and a non interest bearing note payable of million  resulting in a total purchase price of million 
we also acquired primarily gas producing properties in northwest oklahoma and the san juan basin of new mexico for an estimated purchase price of million 
the acquisitions increased reserves by approximately million bbls of oil and bcf of gas

east texas area we began operations in the east texas area in with the purchase of bcfe of reserves in eight major fields 
these properties are located in east texas and northwestern louisiana and produce primarily from the rodessa  travis peak  cotton valley sandstone  bossier sandstone and cotton valley limestone formations between  feet and  feet 
development in the east texas area has more than doubled reserves since acquisition  and with our acquisitions  we now have an interest in more than  gross  net acres and a current development inventory of to  wells with an estimated tcfe of reserve potential 
we own an interest in  gross  net wells which we operate and gross net wells operated by others 
we also own the related gathering facilities 
freestone trend the freestone trend area is located in the western shelf of the east texas basin in freestone  robertson  limestone and leon counties 
this area includes the freestone  bald prairie  bear grass  oaks  teague  farrar  dew and luna fields and was our most active gas development area in  where gross net gas wells were drilled and ten workovers were performed 
initial development was concentrated in the travis peak formation  but is now focused on multi pay development of the deeper horizons including the cotton valley and bossier sandstones  and cotton valley limestone 
a mile pipeline system  completed in january  connects the major fields and allows multiple exit points for marketing 
currently transporting  mcf per day  our gathering system was increased to more than  mcf per day 
we plan to continue our expansion efforts in this area by drilling approximately wells in other east texas fields other fields in the east texas area include willow springs  opelika  cotton valley  colquitt  tri cities  whelan  north lansing and logansport which provide opportunities for field extensions and infill drilling 
in  we drilled seven wells and performed workovers in these fields 
in  we plan to drill five wells and perform workovers 
as a part of our acquisition from marathon  we acquired an interest in a cotton valley gas plant that we now 
table of contents operate 
this plant processes approximately  bbls of natural gas liquids per day  primarily from our own production in the surrounding wells 
arkoma basin area during  we acquired bcfe of reserves and a gas gathering system in the arkoma basin of arkansas and oklahoma 
the arkoma basin  discovered in the s  extends from central arkansas into southeastern oklahoma and is known for shallow production decline rates  multiple formations and complex geology 
xto controls of arkansas production from the arkoma basin and is the largest natural gas producer in arkansas with over  gross acres of leasehold 
we own an interest in gross net wells which we operate and gross net wells operated by others 
of these wells  gross net operated wells and gross net nonoperated wells are dual completions 
our fault block analysis technique has identified trapped hydrocarbons in offsetting and new reservoirs across the basin 
during  we drilled wells and completed workovers  of which were stimulation recompletions and of which were wellhead compressor installations 
our properties can be separated into three distinct areas which are the arkansas fairway trend  the arkansas overthrust trend and the oklahoma cromwell atoka trend 
arkansas fairway trend the arkansas fairway trend comprises multiple sandstones at depths ranging from  to  feet in the atoka and morrow intervals 
in  the orr and hale sandstones were targets for our drilling in the aetna  silex and cecil fields where wells were drilled and workovers were performed 
drilling was concentrated in the aetna and cecil fields where compression was also upgraded 
in  we plan to drill wells 
arkansas overthrust trend the arkansas overthrust trend area  located south of the arkansas fairway trend  typically has multiple thrust faults that created isolated reservoirs 
production is found at varying depths  ranging from  to  feet  in the chismville  booneville and gragg fields 
this extremely complex geology requires an ongoing process to develop the best exploitation opportunities 
the use of electric imaging logs has enhanced the process of identifying new well locations 
in  acre well spacing was approved which added to potential well locations in the booneville and chismville fields 
reduced well spacing in the gragg field may occur in we drilled wells in this area in and completed workovers 
in  we plan to drill wells 
oklahoma cromwell atoka trend the oklahoma cromwell atoka trend of southeastern oklahoma was originally developed in the s targeting the cromwell sandstones  with the atoka and wapanuka limestones as secondary objectives 
development activities were concentrated in the ashland and south pine hollow fields where wells were drilled and workovers were performed in in  there will be approximately ten wells drilled in this area 
hugoton royalty trust areas a substantial portion of properties in the mid continent area  the hugoton area and the green river basin of the rocky mountains are subject to an net profits interest conveyed to the hugoton royalty trust as of december we sold of our hugoton royalty trust units in and mid continent area xto is one of the largest producers in the major and woodward counties  oklahoma area of the anadarko basin 
we operate gross net wells and have an interest in gross net wells operated by others 
oil and gas were first discovered in the major county area in the fields in the major and woodward counties area are characterized by oil and gas production from a variety of structural and stratigraphic traps 
productive zones range from  to  feet and include the oswego  red fork  inola  chester  manning  mississippian  hunton and arbuckle formations 

table of contents development in the major county area focuses on mechanical improvements  restimulations and recompletions to shallower zones and development drilling 
during  we participated in the drilling of eight gross net wells in the northwestern portion of the county  targeting the mississippian formation 
we have budgeted six drill wells and workovers in major county for we were also very active in woodward county  oklahoma  where gross net wells were drilled which targeted the chester formation 
in  we plan to drill up to wells and to perform as many as five workovers 
we operate a gathering system and pipeline in the major county area 
the gathering system collects gas from over wells through miles of pipeline in the major county area 
the gathering system has current throughput of approximately  mcf per day  of which is produced from company operated wells 
estimated capacity of the gathering system is  mcf per day 
gas is delivered to a processing plant owned and operated by a third party  and then transmitted by a company operated residue pipeline to a connection with an interstate pipeline 
hugoton area the hugoton field  discovered in  covers parts of texas  oklahoma and kansas and is the largest gas field in north america with an estimated five million productive acres 
xto owns an interest in gross net wells that we operate and gross net wells operated by others 
during  development of the hugoton area included four successful recompletions to the towanda formation 
we also continued our restimulation program in the chase intervals by completing restimulations in we plan to perform chase restimulations during approximately of our hugoton gas production is delivered to the tyrone plant  a gas processing plant we operate 
during  we completed the acquisition of approximately miles of low pressure gathering lines  increasing production by  mcf per day 
during and  we installed additional lateral compressors that lowered the line pressure and increased production in various areas of the hugoton field 
green river basin the green river basin is located in southwestern wyoming 
we have interests in gross net wells that we operate and gross net wells operated by others in the fontenelle field area 
gas production began in the fontenelle area in the early s and the producing reservoirs are the cretaceous aged frontier  baxter and dakota sandstones at depths ranging from  to  feet 
development potential for the fields in this area include deepening and opening new producing zones in existing wells  drilling new wells and adding compression to lower line pressures 
development activities in the fontenelle field were delayed for most of by pipeline limitations and price volatility 
during  we plan to perform five workovers and may drill up to five wells in the green river basin 
san juan basin area the san juan basin of northwestern new mexico and southwestern colorado contains the second largest deposit of natural gas reserves in north america 
we acquired a large portion of our interests in the san juan basin in december with the purchase of approximately bcfe from amoco corporation 
in  we purchased approximately bcfe from marathon oil company and j 
m 
huber corporation and extended our coalbed methane operations into colorado 
we have now identified more than potential drilling locations with approximately bcfe reserve potential 
xto owns an interest in gross net wells that it operates and gross net wells operated by others 
of these wells  gross net operated wells and gross net nonoperated wells are dual completions 
in  we participated in the drilling of wells and completed workovers 
drilling focused on the fruitland coal formation at shallow intervals of  feet or less and the mesaverde and dakota formations at depths of  to  feet 
during  we plan to drill to wells and perform to workovers and recompletions  including installation of as many as wellhead compressors and pumping units 
fruitland coal and pictured cliffs formations xto has centered its fruitland coal development efforts on trend extensions 
our coalbed methane play is focused on the northwestern portion of the basin surrounding the city of farmington  new mexico and in the southwestern portion of colorado 
we drilled one fruitland coal well in and 
table of contents plan to drill an additional wells in a request to reduce current spacing of coalbed methane wells from acres to acres was approved by regulatory authorities in october  adding more than potential well locations 
mesaverde and dakota formations eighty acre spacing was approved in january  which now allows wells to be drilled with multiple zone targets 
we have identified more than potential well locations that will allow deeper drilling through the dakota to the burro canyon and morrison sandstones 
the reduced spacing will generate significant future development opportunities  and additional test wells are planned for in  we drilled dakota and mesaverde wells 
thirty one drill wells are planned for permian basin area university block the university block field is located in andrews county  texas and was discovered in we own interests in gross net operated wells 
productive zones are of wolfcamp  pennsylvanian and devonian age and range from  to  feet 
development potential includes proper wellbore utilization  recompletions  infill drilling and improvement of waterflood efficiency 
development in focused on the devonian  grayburg wolfcamp formations 
this field was one of our most active oil development areas during where xto drilled seven wells  including four horizontal sidetrack wells 
we also discovered a new shallow grayburg producing interval 
during  we plan to drill up to wells 
prentice field 
the prentice field is located in terry and yoakum counties  texas 
discovered in  the prentice field produces from carbonate reservoirs in the clear fork and glorieta formations at depths ranging from  to  feet 
the prentice field has been separated into several waterflood units for secondary recovery operations 
the prentice northeast unit was formed in with waterflood operations commencing a year later 
development potential exists through infill drilling and improvement of waterflood efficiency 
tertiary recovery potential also exists through carbon dioxide flooding 
we operate the prentice northeast unit  where we have a working interest in wells 
we also own an interest in gross net nonoperated wells 
during  we continued our acre development drilling program by drilling eight gross net vertical wells in the prentice field 
during  we plan to continue our expansion of the potential infill area by drilling as many as eight wells 
wasson field 
the wasson field  discovered in  is located in gaines and yoakum counties  texas and produces from the san andres formation at depths ranging from  to  feet 
the cornell unit was formed in and has development potential that exists through infill drilling and improvement of waterflood efficiency 
we have a working interest in the unit 
in  we drilled three acre infill oil wells and one gas cap well  and in we plan to drill three oil wells and three gas cap wells in this area 
alaska cook inlet area in september  we acquired a working interest in two state of alaska leases and the offshore installations in the middle ground shoal field of the cook inlet 
the properties included wells  two operated production platforms set in feet of water about seven miles offshore  and a interest in certain operated production pipelines and onshore processing facilities 
oil was discovered in the cook inlet in and  to date  more than million bbls have been produced 
the field is separated into east and west flanks by a crestal fault 
waterflooding of the east flank has been successful  but the west flank has not been fully developed or efficiently waterflooded 
production is primarily from multiple zones within the miocene oligocene aged tyonek formation between  feet and  feet subsea 
in  we completed an east flank simulation study 
one east flank and three west flank wells were drilled in three additional east flank wells are planned for 
table of contents reserves the following are definitions of terms used in the following disclosures of oil and natural gas reserves proved reserves estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids which  upon analysis of geologic and engineering data  appear with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in the future from known oil and gas reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
proved developed reserves proved reserves which can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
proved undeveloped reserves proved reserves which are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required 
estimated future net revenues also referred to herein as estimated future net cash flows 
computational result of applying current prices of oil and gas with consideration of price changes only to the extent provided by existing contractual arrangements to estimated future production from proved oil and gas reserves as of the date of the latest balance sheet presented  less estimated future expenditures based on current costs to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves 
present value of estimated future net cash flows also referred to herein as standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows or standardized measure

table of contents oil and gas prices and production and development costs as of december of each such year  without escalation 
year end average realized prices used in the estimation of proved reserves were per bbl for oil  per mcf for gas and per bbl for natural gas liquids 
see note to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding estimated proved reserves 
estimated future net cash flows  and the related discounted present value  of year end proved reserves are significantly higher than at year end because of significantly lower product prices used in the estimation of year end proved reserves 
year end prices were per bbl for oil  per mcf for gas and per bbl for natural gas liquids 
uncertainties are inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves  including many factors beyond our control 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating subsurface accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner  and the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and the interpretation thereof 
as a result  estimates by different engineers often vary  sometimes significantly 
in addition  physical factors such as the results of drilling  testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate  as well as economic factors such as change in product prices  may justify revision of such estimates 
accordingly  oil and gas quantities ultimately recovered will vary from reserve estimates 
during  we filed estimates of oil and gas reserves as of december  with the us department of energy on form eia these estimates are consistent with the reserve data reported for the year ended december  in note to consolidated financial statements  with the exception that form eia includes only reserves from properties operated by the company 
exploration and production data for the following data  gross refers to the total wells or acres in which we own a working interest and net refers to gross wells or acres multiplied by the percentage working interest owned by us 
although many wells produce both oil and gas  a well is categorized as an oil well or a gas well based upon the ratio of oil to gas production

table of contents oil and gas sales prices and production costs the following table shows the average sales prices per unit of production and the production expense and taxes  transportation and other expense per mcfe quantities produced for the indicated period year ended december sales prices oil per bbl gas per mcf natural gas liquids per bbl production expense per mcfe taxes  transportation and other expense per mcfe delivery commitments under a production payment  we have committed to deliver bcf bcf net to xto s interest beginning approximately september delivery of the committed volumes is in east texas 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
as partial consideration for an acquisition  we agreed to sell gas volumes of  mcf per day in at specified discounts from index prices 
delivery of  mcf per day of these volumes is from the san juan basin  with the remainder from the east texas basin 
as part of an acquisition  we assumed a commitment to sell  mcf of gas per day in arkansas through april at prices which are adjusted by the monthly index price 
the prices ranged from to per mcf in the company s production and reserves are adequate to meet the above sales commitments 
competition and markets we face competition from other oil and gas companies in all aspects of our business  including acquisition of producing properties and oil and gas leases  marketing of oil and gas  and obtaining goods  services and labor 
many of our competitors have substantially larger financial and other resources 
factors that affect xto s ability to acquire producing properties include available funds  available information about the property and our standards established for minimum projected return on investment 
gathering systems are the only practical method for the intermediate transportation of natural gas 
therefore  competition for natural gas delivery is presented by other pipelines and gathering systems 
competition is also presented by alternative fuel sources  including heating oil and other fossil fuels 
because of the long lived  high margin nature of our oil and gas reserves and management s experience and expertise in exploiting these reserves  management believes that it effectively competes in the market 
our ability to market oil and gas depends on many factors beyond our control  including the extent of domestic production and imports of oil and gas  the proximity of our gas production to pipelines  the available capacity in such pipelines  the demand for oil and gas  and the effects of weather and state and federal regulation 
we cannot assure that we will always be able to market all of our production at favorable prices 
the company does not currently believe that the loss of any of our oil or gas purchasers would have a material adverse effect on our operations 
decreases in oil and gas prices have had and could have in the future an adverse effect on our acquisition and development programs  proved reserves  revenues  profitability  cash flow and dividends

table of contents federal and state regulations there have been  and continue to be  numerous federal and state laws and regulations governing the oil and gas industry that are often changed in response to the current political or economic environment 
compliance with this regulatory burden is often difficult and costly and may carry substantial penalties for noncompliance 
the following are some specific regulations that may affect us 
we cannot predict the impact of these or future legislative or regulatory initiatives 
federal regulation of natural gas the interstate transportation and sale for resale of natural gas is subject to federal regulation  including transportation rates charged and various other matters  by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
federal wellhead price controls on all domestic gas were terminated on january   and none of our gathering systems are currently subject to ferc regulation 
we cannot predict the impact of future government regulation on any natural gas facilities 
although ferc s regulations should generally facilitate the transportation of gas produced from our properties and the direct access to end user markets  the future impact of these regulations on marketing xto s production or on its gas transportation business cannot be predicted 
the company  however  does not believe that it will be affected differently than competing producers and marketers 
federal regulation of oil sales of crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at market prices 
the net price received from the sale of these products is affected by market transportation costs 
a significant part of our oil production is transported by pipeline 
under rules adopted by ferc effective january  interstate oil pipelines can change rates based on an inflation index  though other rate mechanisms may be used in specific circumstances 
these rules have had little effect on our oil transportation cost 
state regulation oil and gas operations are subject to various types of regulation at the state and local levels 
such regulation includes requirements for drilling permits  the method of developing new fields  the spacing and operations of wells and waste prevention 
the production rate may be regulated and the maximum daily production allowable from oil and gas wells may be established on a market demand or conservation basis 
these regulations may limit production by well and the number of wells that can be drilled 
we may become a party to agreements relating to the construction or operations of pipeline systems for the transportation of natural gas 
to the extent that such gas is produced  transported and consumed wholly within one state  such operations may  in certain instances  be subject to the state s administrative authority charged with regulating pipelines 
the rates that can be charged for gas  the transportation of gas  and the construction and operation of such pipelines would be subject to the regulations governing such matters 
certain states have recently adopted regulations with respect to gathering systems  and other states are considering similar regulations 
new regulations have not had a material effect on the operations of our gathering systems  but xto cannot predict whether any further rules will be adopted or  if adopted  the effect these rules may have on its gathering systems 
federal  state or native american leases our operations on federal  state or native american oil and gas leases are subject to numerous restrictions  including nondiscrimination statutes 
such operations must be conducted pursuant to certain on site security regulations and other permits and authorizations issued by the bureau of land management  minerals management service and other agencies 

table of contents environmental regulations various federal  state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment  directly impact oil and gas exploration  development and production operations  and consequently may impact our operations and costs 
management believes that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
to date  we have not expended any material amounts to comply with such regulations  and management does not currently anticipate that future compliance will have a materially adverse effect on the consolidated financial position or results of operations of xto 
employees we had employees as of december  none of the employees are represented by a union

table of contents item legal proceedings on april   a class action lawsuit  styled booth  et al 
v 
cross timbers oil company  was filed against us in the district court of dewey county  oklahoma 
the action was filed on behalf of all persons who  at any time since june  have been paid royalties on gas produced from any gas well within the state of oklahoma under which we have assumed the obligation to pay royalties 
the plaintiffs allege that we reduced royalty payments by post production deductions and entered into contracts with subsidiaries that were not arm s length transactions 
the plaintiffs further allege that these actions reduced the royalties paid to the plaintiffs and those similarly situated  and that such actions are a breach of the leases under which the royalties are paid 
these deductions allegedly include production and post production costs  marketing costs  administration costs and costs incurred by us in gathering  compressing  dehydrating  processing  treating  blending and or transporting the gas produced 
we contend that  to the extent any fees are proportionately borne by the plaintiffs  these fees are established by arm s length negotiations with third parties or  if charged by affiliates  are comparable to fees charged by third party gatherers or processors 
we further contend that any such fees enhance the value of the gas or the products derived from the gas 
the parties have signed a settlement agreement under which we will pay million to settle the plaintiffs claims for the period january  through june  our portion of this liability  net of amounts allocable to hugoton royalty trust units we do not own  is million  which has been accrued in our financial statements 
the court has tentatively approved the settlement  subject to a fairness hearing in april on october   an action  styled united states of america ex rel 
grynberg v 
cross timbers oil company  et al  was filed in the u 
s 
district court for the western district of oklahoma against us and certain of our subsidiaries by jack j 
grynberg on behalf of the united states under the qui tam provisions of the false claims act 
the plaintiff alleges that we underpaid royalties on gas produced from federal leases and lands owned by native americans in amounts in excess of during at least the past years as a result of mismeasuring the volume of gas and incorrectly analyzing its heating content 
the plaintiff also alleges that we have failed to pay the fair market value of the carbon dioxide produced 
according to the us department of justice  the plaintiff has made similar allegations in over actions filed against more than other companies 
the plaintiff seeks to recover the amount of royalties not paid  together with treble damages  a civil penalty of  to  for each violation and attorney fees and expenses 
the plaintiff also seeks an order for us to cease the allegedly improper measuring practices 
after its review  the department of justice decided in april not to intervene and asked the court to unseal the case 
the court unsealed the case in may a multi district litigation panel ordered that the lawsuits against us and other companies filed by grynberg be transferred and consolidated to the federal district court in wyoming 
we believe that the allegations of this lawsuit are without merit and intend to vigorously defend the action 
any potential liability from this claim cannot currently be reasonably estimated  and no provision has been accrued in our financial statements 
in february  the department of interior notified us and several other producers that certain native american leases located in the san juan basin had expired because of the failure of the leases to produce in paying quantities from february through august the department of interior demanded abandonment of the property as well as payment of the gross proceeds from the wells minus royalties paid from the date of the alleged cessation of production to present 
we have reached a tentative settlement with the department of interior to pay  in settlement of all claims 
the settlement should be finalized in second quarter management s estimate of the potential liability from this claim has been accrued in our financial statements 
in june  we were served with a lawsuit styled price  et al 
v 
gas pipelines  et al 
formerly quinque case 
the action was filed in the district court of stevens county  kansas  against us and one of our subsidiaries  along with over natural gas transmission companies  producers  gatherers and processors of natural gas 
plaintiffs seek to represent a class of plaintiffs consisting of all similarly situated gas working interest owners  overriding royalty owners and royalty owners either from whom the defendants had purchased natural gas or who received economic benefit from the sale of such gas since january  the allegations in the case are similar to those in the grynberg case  however  the price case broadens the claims to cover all oil and gas leases other than the federal and native american leases that are the subject of the grynberg case 
the complaint alleges that the defendants have mismeasured both the volume and heating content of natural gas delivered into their pipelines resulting in underpayments to the plaintiffs 
plaintiffs assert a breach of contract claim  negligent or intentional misrepresentation  civil conspiracy  common carrier liability  conversion  violation of a variety of kansas statutes and other common law causes of action 
the amount of damages was not specified in the complaint 
in february  we and one of our subsidiaries were dismissed from the 
table of contents suit and another subsidiary was added 
a hearing on whether to certify the case as a class action was held in january  and the decision of the court is pending 
we elieve that the allegations of this lawsuit are without merit and intend to vigorously defend the action 
any potential liability from this claim cannot currently be reasonably estimated  and no provision has been accrued in our financial statements 
we are involved in various other lawsuits and certain governmental proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business 
company management and legal counsel do not believe that the ultimate resolution of these claims  including the lawsuits described above  will have a material effect on our financial position or liquidity  although an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse effect on the operations of a given interim period or year

because of exclusion of changes in operating assets and liabilities and exploration expense  this cash flow statistic is different from cash provided used by operating activities  as is disclosed under generally accepted accounting principles and reconciled to operating cash flow as follows cash provided used by operating activities changes in operating assets and liabilities exploration expense operating cash flow we believe operating cash flow is a better liquidity indicator for oil and gas producers because of the adjustments made to cash provided used by operating activities  explained as follows adjustment for changes in operating assets and liabilities eliminates fluctuations related to the timing of cash receipts and disbursements  which can vary from period to period because of conditions we cannot control for example  the day of the week on which the last day of the period falls  and results in attributing cash flow to operations of the period that provided used the cash flow 
adjustment for exploration expense is to provide an amount comparable to operating cash flow for full cost companies and to eliminate the effect of a discretionary expenditure that is part of our capital budget 
h for purposes of calculating this ratio  earnings are before income tax and fixed charges 
fixed charges include interest costs  the portion of rentals considered to be representative of the interest factor and preferred stock dividends

hugoton royalty trust sales 
we created hugoton royalty trust in december by conveying net profits interests in producing properties in kansas  oklahoma and wyoming 
in april and may  we sold million units  or  of hugoton royalty trust in its initial public offering 
total proceeds from this sale were million  which were used to reduce bank debt 
total gain on sale  including the sale of units pursuant to an employee incentive plan  was million before income tax 
in october and november  we sold million units  or approximately  of hugoton royalty trust pursuant to an employee incentive plan at a total gain of million before income tax 
property sales 
in march  we sold oil and gas producing properties in crockett county  texas and lea county  new mexico for total gross proceeds of million

exploration activity has been primarily geological and geophysical analysis  including seismic studies  of undeveloped properties 
exploratory expenditures were million in  million in and million in exploration expense for includes dry hole expense of million 
development and exploration program 
we have budgeted million for our development and exploration program  which is expected to be funded primarily by cash flow from operations 
we anticipate exploration expenditures will be approximately of the budget 
the cost of any property acquisitions during may reduce the amount currently budgeted for development and exploration 
the total capital budget  including acquisitions  will be adjusted throughout to focus on opportunities offering the highest rates of return 
common stock transactions 
in november  we sold million shares of common stock from treasury with net proceeds of approximately million 
the proceeds were used to reduce bank debt 
treasury stock purchases 
we periodically repurchase shares of our common stock as part of our strategic acquisition plans 
we purchased on the open market million shares at a cost of million in as of march   million shares remain under the may board of directors authorization to purchase an additional million shares 
conversion of preferred stock 
in and  all outstanding preferred stock was converted into million shares of common stock 
investment in equity securities 
in  we purchased what we believed to be undervalued oil and gas reserves by acquiring common stock of publicly traded independent oil and gas producers at a total cost of million 
for accounting purposes  we considered equity securities purchased in to be trading securities since they were purchased with the intent to resell in the near future  and therefore recognized unrealized investment gains and losses in the income statements 
after selling a portion of these securities in and  we sold our remaining investment in equity securities in for million 
we recognized a gain of million in related to this investment 
hedging activities 
we enter futures contracts  collars and basis swap agreements  as well as fixed price physical delivery contracts  to hedge our exposure to product price volatility 
our policy is to routinely hedge a portion of our production at commodity prices management deems attractive 
while there is a risk we may not be able to realize the benefit of rising prices  management plans to continue its hedging strategy because of the benefits provided by predictable  stable cash flow 
during  all hedging activities increased gas revenue by million and decreased oil revenue by million 
all hedging activities increased gas revenue by million in during  hedging activities reduced gas revenue by million and reduced oil revenue by million 
the following summarizes our april through december natural gas and crude oil nymex hedging positions at march   excluding basis adjustments which have been separately hedged 
prices to be realized for hedged production may be less than these nymex prices because of location  quality and other adjustments

cumulative effect of accounting change for derivatives 
on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
by recording a one time after tax charge of million in the income statement for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle and an unrealized loss of million in accumulated other comprehensive income  which is an element of stockholders equity 
the unrealized loss was related to the derivative fair value of cash flow hedges 
the charge to the income statement was primarily related to our gas physical delivery contract with crude oil based pricing 
derivative fair value gain loss 
realized and unrealized non hedge derivative gains and losses are recorded in our income statements 
we recorded a million gain in  a million gain in and a million loss in related to changes in fair value of non hedge derivatives 
the loss and million of the gain are related to the change in fair value of call options that we sold in as part of our hedging activities 
because written call options do not provide protection against declining prices  they do not qualify for hedge or loss deferral accounting 
most of the remaining gain in is related to the change in fair value of a gas physical delivery contract with crude oil based pricing  the loss on which was initially recorded in the cumulative effect of accounting change for derivatives 
unrealized derivative gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
at december   we have a net unrealized loss of million net of million tax in accumulated other comprehensive income related to the fair value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges 
the ultimate settlement value of these hedges will be recognized in the income statement as oil and gas revenue when the related production occurs through and enron corporation bankruptcy and settlement 
in december  after enron corporation filed for bankruptcy  we had recorded a million receivable from enron and a million btu swap contract payable to enron 
in december  we paid enron corporation million in settlement of all claims  resulting in recognition of million in gas revenue and a million gain 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
extinguishment of debt 
we purchased and canceled million of our senior subordinated notes in april  and redeemed the remaining million of the notes in june in november  we purchased and canceled million of our senior subordinated notes 
as a result of these transactions  we recorded a total pre tax loss on extinguishment of debt of million  which includes the effects of redemption premium paid and expensing related deferred debt costs 
we reported this loss as non extraordinary in accordance with early adoption provisions of sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections  related to rescission of sfas no 
 reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt 
incentive compensation 
incentive compensation generally results from awards of performance shares  royalty trust options and stock appreciation rights  and subsequent changes in our stock price 
incentive compensation totaled million in  million in and million in  which was primarily related to performance share grants  as well as royalty trust option exercises in as of december   there were  performance shares outstanding that vest when the common stock price reaches   performance shares outstanding that vest when the common stock price reaches and  performance shares that vest in 
table of contents product prices 
in addition to supply and demand  oil and gas prices are affected by seasonal  political and other conditions we generally cannot control or predict 
oil 
crude oil prices are generally determined by global supply and demand 
despite opec production increases in  increased demand sustained higher prices 
the west texas intermediate wti posted price reached per bbl in september  then its highest level in ten years 
lagging demand  attributable to a worldwide economic slowdown  caused oil prices to decline during the remainder of opec members agreed to cut daily production by one million barrels in april and an additional one million barrels in september to adjust for weak demand and excess supply 
the economic decline was accelerated by the terrorist attacks in the united states on september   placing further downward pressure on oil prices 
opec cut an additional million barrels per day for oil prices increased during because of opec production discipline and rising uncertainty surrounding the middle east 
opec members agreed to increase daily oil production million barrels beginning february   to help stabilize a volatile world market 
with the war in iraq  however  oil prices are expected to remain volatile 
we use commodity price hedging instruments to reduce our exposure to oil price fluctuations 
excluding the effect of these hedging instruments  our average oil price was in and in we did not hedge oil prices in and our average oil price was 
at march   the average nymex oil price for the following months was per bbl 
for first quarter  we have hedged  bbls per day of crude oil production at an average nymex price of per bbl 
excluding these hedged volumes  we estimate that a per barrel increase or decrease in the average oil sales price would result in approximately a million change in annual operating cash flow 
gas 
natural gas prices are dependent upon north american supply and demand  which is affected by weather and economic conditions 
natural gas competes with alternative energy sources as a fuel for heating and the generation of electricity 
at the beginning of  nymex gas prices approximated per mmbtu 
gas prices strengthened in  reaching a record high of per mmbtu in december as winter demand strained gas supplies 
gas prices declined during the remainder of because of fuel switching due to higher prices  milder weather and a weaker economy  which reduced the demand for gas to generate electricity and resulted in increased gas storage levels 
as of december   the nymex gas price was per mmbtu 
despite the winter of being one of the warmest on record and resulting higher than average storage levels  gas prices increased during as a result of low levels of drilling activity  increased industrial demand  colder weather and international instability 
at march   the average nymex gas price for the following months was per mmbtu 
we use commodity price hedging instruments  including fixed price physical delivery contracts  to reduce our exposure to gas price fluctuations 
excluding the effect of these hedging instruments  our average gas price was in  in and in we have hedges in place on approximately of expected gas production with an average nymex price of 
we have also hedged  mcf per day of natural gas production for at an average nymex price of per mcf 
excluding these hedged volumes  we estimate that a per mcf increase or decrease in the average gas sales price would result in a million change in annual operating cash flow 
impairment provision 
we evaluate possible impairment of producing properties when conditions indicate they may be impaired 
this evaluation is based on an assessment of recoverability of net property costs from estimated future net cash flows from those properties 
estimated future net cash flows are based on management s best estimate of projected oil and gas reserves and prices 
we have not recorded impairment of producing properties since a million provision was recorded in if oil and gas prices significantly decline  we may be required to record impairment provisions for producing properties in the future  which could be material

see product prices under general above 
we do not have any investments in unconsolidated entities or persons that could materially affect the liquidity or the availability of capital resources 
financial condition total assets increased from billion at december  to billion at december   primarily because of company growth related to acquisitions and development 
as of december   total capitalization was billion  of which was long term debt 
capitalization at december  was billion of which was long term debt 
the increase in the debt to capitalization ratio from year end to is primarily because of a change in accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity  from a gain to a loss position related to the effect of higher gas prices on hedge derivatives 
working capital we generally maintain low cash and cash equivalent balances because we use available funds to reduce bank debt 
short term liquidity needs are satisfied by bank commitments under the loan agreement see financing below 
because of this  and since our principal source of operating cash flows ie  proved reserves to be produced in the following year cannot be reported as working capital  we often have low or negative working capital 
the decrease from working capital of million at december  to negative working capital of million at december  was primarily attributable to the change in derivative fair value assets and liabilities  net of the related tax effects 
any cash settlement of hedge derivatives should be offset by increased or decreased cash flows from our sales of related production 
therefore  we believe that most of the changes in derivative fair value assets and liabilities are offset by changes in value of our oil and gas reserves 
this offsetting change in value of oil and gas reserves  however  is not recorded in the financial statements 
none of our derivative contracts have margin requirements or collateral provisions which could require funding prior to the scheduled cash settlement date 
when the monthly cash settlement amount under our hedge derivatives is calculated  if market prices are higher than the fixed contract prices  we are required to pay the contract counterparties 
while this payment will ultimately be funded by higher prices received from sale of our production  production receipts lag payments to the counterparties by as much as six weeks 
any interim cash needs are funded by borrowings under our revolving credit agreement 
because of significant payments to counterparties in  we have made draws on our bank debt  reducing our unused borrowing capacity to a low of million in march we will repay these borrowings upon receipt of payment for our production 
most of our receivables are from a diverse group of companies including major energy companies  pipeline companies  local distribution companies and end users in various industries 
because of declining credit ratings of some of our customers  we have greater concentrations of credit with a few large integrated energy companies with investment grade ratings 
financial and commodity based futures and swap contracts expose us to credit risk of nonperformance by the counterparty to the contracts 
this exposure is diversified among major investment grade financial institutions 
letters of credit or other appropriate security are obtained as considered necessary to limit risk of loss

based on the value of our reserves  the borrowing base is billion effective june   and the total bank commitment is million 
the borrowing base is redetermined annually based on the value and expected cash flow of our proved oil and gas reserves 
if  at any time  senior debt exceeds the borrowing base then in effect  the banks may require that the excess be repaid within a year 
based on reserve values at december  and using parameters specified by the banks  we propose to increase the borrowing base to billion 
assuming approval by the banks  this increase would be effective june  borrowings under the loan agreement are due may   but may be prepaid at any time without penalty 
we may renegotiate the loan agreement to increase borrowing capacity and extend the revolving facility

to date  we have not spent significant amounts to comply with environmental or safety regulations  and we do not expect to do so during however  new regulations  enforcement policies  claims for damages or other events could result in significant future costs 
dividends the board of directors declared quarterly dividends of per common share for the first and second quarter  per common share for each quarter from the third quarter through first quarter and per common share each quarter for the remainder of and in february  the board of directors declared a first quarter dividend of per common share 
our ability to pay dividends is dependent upon available cash flow  as well as other factors 
in addition  our debt agreements restrict the amount of common stock dividends and treasury stock repurchases to of cash flow from operations  as defined  for the last four quarters 

table of contents contractual obligations and commitments the following summarizes our significant obligations and commitments to make future contractual payments as of december  we have not guaranteed the debt or obligations of any other party  nor do we have any other arrangements or relationships with other entities that could potentially result in unconsolidated debt 
long term debt 
borrowings under our senior bank revolving credit facility were million at december  bank debt is not due until may  but may be prepaid at any date 
we may renegotiate our bank debt to increase borrowing capacity and extend its maturity 
at december   senior notes due in april totaled million and senior subordinated notes due in november totaled million 
subordinated debt may currently be redeemed at a price of approximately of par 
for further information regarding long term debt  see note to consolidated financial statements 
operating leases 
our minimum lease payment commitments under noncancelable lease agreements totaled million at december  estimated annual payments under these lease agreements for the next five years are disclosed in note to consolidated financial statements 
estimated annual payments total million for and decline for subsequent years 
guarantees 
under the terms of some of our operating leases  we have various residual value guarantees and other payment provisions upon our election to return the equipment under certain specified conditions 
as of december   we estimate the total contingent payable under these guarantees does not exceed million 
drilling contracts 
we have drilling rig commitments of million in early termination of these contracts would require a termination fee of million in lieu of these commitments 
these costs are part of our budgeted capital expenditures of million for derivative contracts 
we have entered into futures contracts and swaps to hedge our exposure to oil and natural gas price fluctuations 
as of december   market prices generally exceeded the fixed prices specified by these contracts  resulting in a net derivative fair value loss at december  of million  of which million relates to contracts settling in and million relates to contracts settling in through if market prices are higher than the contract prices when the cash settlement amount is calculated  we are required to pay the contract counterparties 
while such payments will be funded by higher prices received from the sale of our production  production receipts may be received as much as six weeks after payment to counterparties and can result in draws on our revolving credit facility 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
post retirement plans we have a retiree medical plan that provides retirees age through with at least five years of service with health care benefits similar to those provided employees 
otherwise  retirement benefits are only provided through our defined contribution k plan 
post retirement medical benefits are not prefunded  but are paid when incurred 
we do not currently anticipate that retiree medical plan costs will be significant in relation to the company s future financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
related party transactions we have limited related party transactions  as further disclosed in note to consolidated financial statements 
a company  partially owned by one of our directors  performed consulting services in connection with our acquisition of properties in east texas  louisiana and the san juan basin of new mexico during see note to consolidated financial statements 
the director related company received a fee of million for these services  which was of the total of the property purchase price and the related exchange transaction value 
this director related company received consulting fees of  in for consulting services performed in connection with our acquisition and divestiture programs 
in  this same director related company performed consulting services in connection with a producing property acquisition and was entitled to receive  at its election  either a working interest or a overriding royalty interest conveyed from our working interest in the properties after payout of acquisition and operating costs 
we acquired this potential interest from the director related company and other parties in for a price of million  
table of contents pursuant to an independent fairness opinion 
the director related company received million of the total purchase price 
critical accounting policies our financial position and results of operations are significantly affected by accounting policies and estimates related to our oil and gas properties  proved reserves  and commodity prices and risk management  as summarized below 
oil and gas property accounting oil and gas exploration and production companies may elect to account for their property costs using either the successful efforts or full cost accounting method 
under the successful efforts method  unsuccessful exploratory well costs  as well as all exploratory geological and geophysical costs  are expensed 
under the full cost method  all exploration costs are capitalized  regardless of success 
selection of the oil and gas accounting method can have a significant impact on a company s financial results 
we use the successful efforts method of accounting and generally pursue acquisitions and development of proved reserves as opposed to exploration activities 
property costs must be expensed through an impairment provision if in excess of the estimated future cash flows of proved reserves 
we evaluate possible impairment of producing properties when conditions indicate that they may be impaired 
cash flow pricing estimates are based on existing proved reserve and production information and pricing assumptions that management believes are reasonable 
individually significant undeveloped properties are reviewed for impairment on a property by property basis  and impairment of other undeveloped properties is done on a total basis 
our impairment of producing properties has been limited to a million provision recorded in our impairment provisions have been limited  and we do not expect significant impairment provisions in the near future  because of our relatively low acquisition and development costs compared with current product prices 
by comparison  full cost companies must record impairment under a ceiling test which is computed using discounted estimated future after tax cash flows based on expected market prices 
this results in more frequent and higher impairment provisions under the full cost method when prices decline significantly 
oil and gas reserves our proved oil and gas reserves are estimated by independent petroleum engineers 
reserve engineering is a subjective process that is dependent upon the quality of available data and the interpretation thereof 
estimates by different engineers often vary  sometimes significantly 
in addition  physical factors such as the results of drilling  testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate  as well as economic factors such as changes in product prices  may justify revision of such estimates 
because proved reserves are required to be estimated using prices at the date of the evaluation  estimated reserve quantities can be significantly impacted by changes in product prices 
accordingly  oil and gas quantities ultimately recovered and the timing of production may be substantially different from previous estimates 
depreciation  depletion and amortization of producing properties is computed on the unit of production method based on estimated proved oil and gas reserves 
if estimated proved reserves decline  future dd a expense will increase and net income will be reduced 
a decline in proved reserves also can result in a required impairment provision  as discussed under oil and gas property accounting above 
the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows and changes in such cash flows  as reported in note to consolidated financial statements  are prepared using assumptions required by the financial accounting standards board and the securities and exchange commission 
such assumptions include using year end oil and gas prices and year end costs for estimated future development and production expenditures 
discounted future net cash flows are calculated using a rate 
changes in any of these assumptions could have a significant impact on the standardized measure 
accordingly  the standardized measure does not represent management s estimated current market value of proved reserves 

table of contents commodity prices and risk management commodity prices significantly affect our operating results  financial condition  cash flows and ability to borrow funds 
current market oil and gas prices are affected by supply and demand as well as seasonal  political and other conditions which we generally cannot control 
oil and gas prices and markets are expected to continue their historical volatility 
see general product prices above 
we attempt to reduce our price risk by entering into financial instruments such as futures contracts  collars and basis swap agreements  as well as fixed price physical delivery contracts 
while these instruments secure a certain price and  therefore  a certain cash flow  there is the risk that we will not be able to realize the benefit of rising prices 
these contracts also expose us to credit risk of nonperformance by the contract counterparties  all of which are major investment grade financial institutions 
we attempt to limit our credit risk by obtaining letters of credit or other appropriate security 
we also have sold call options as part of our hedging program 
call options  however  do not provide a hedge against declining prices  and there is the risk that the call sales proceeds will be less than the benefit a higher sales price would have provided 
while our price risk management activities decrease the volatility of cash flows  they may obscure our operating results and financial condition 
as required under generally accepted accounting principles  we adopted sfas no 
on january  with a significant charge to our income statement and equity related to recording derivative financial instruments at their market value 
subsequent to that date  we recorded significant derivative fair value gains in the income statement and equity related to decline in natural gas prices 
during  we recorded a significant loss related to the fair value of call options 
in each instance  these are projected gains and losses to be realized upon settlement of these contracts in subsequent periods when related production occurs 
these gains and losses are offset by increases and decreases in the market value of our proved reserves  which are not reflected in the financial statements 
derivatives that provide effective cash flow hedges are designated as hedges  and  to the extent the hedge is determined to be effective  we defer related fair value gains and losses in accumulated other comprehensive income until the hedged transaction occurs 
because hedge accounting is not required under generally accepted accounting principles  our operating results as reflected in our financial statements may not be comparable to other companies 
see item a  commodity price risk for the effect of price changes on derivative fair value gains and losses 
accounting changes effective january   we have adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires that the fair value of the liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate can be made 
under the method prescribed by sfas no 
 the retirement obligation is recorded as a liability at its estimated present value at the asset s inception  with the offsetting charge to property cost 
periodic accretion of discount of the estimated liability is recorded in the income statement 
prior to adoption of sfas no 
 we accrued for any estimated asset retirement obligation  net of estimated salvage value  as part of our calculation of depletion and depreciation 
this method resulted in recognition of the obligation over the life of the property on a unit of production basis  with the estimated obligation netted in property cost as part of the accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization balance 
we have used an expected cash flow approach to estimate our asset retirement obligation under sfas no 
as of the january  adoption date  we estimate a retirement obligation of million  an increase in property cost of million  a reduction of accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization of million and a cumulative effect of accounting change gain  net of tax  of million 
as a result of adoption of sfas no 
 we estimate that in accretion of discount expense will be approximately million  and depreciation  depletion and amortization expense will decrease approximately million 

table of contents accounting pronouncements during and january  the financial accounting standards board issued the following statements of financial accounting standards sfas and interpretations fin sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
effective april   we early adopted the provisions of sfas no 
related to rescission of sfas no 
 reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt  by reporting such losses as non extraordinary 
sfas no 
also amends the accounting for certain sale leaseback transactions entered after may   and rescinds sfas nos 
and  and amends other pronouncements for technical corrections for financial statements issued after may  the effects of these other rescissions and amendments are not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for costs associated with exiting an activity including restructurings or disposal of long lived assets be recognized when the liability is incurred and measured at the fair value of the liability 
the provisions of sfas no 
are required to be applied to exit or disposal activities initiated after december   and are not currently expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
the statement also amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the statement is required to be adopted for fiscal years ending after december  a significant portion of our stock based compensation is the award of performance shares  the fair value of which is fully expensed upon vesting when the target stock price is attained 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with apb opinion no 
and do not currently plan to expense stock option awards pursuant to sfas we have early implemented the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
see notes and to consolidated financial statements 
fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin no 
requires that a liability be recorded in the guarantor s balance sheet upon issuance of certain guarantees 
initial recognition and measurement of the liability will be applied on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  fin no 
also requires disclosures about guarantees in financial statements for interim or annual periods ending after december  fin no 
is not expected to materially affect our consolidated financial statements 
we have adopted the disclosure provisions of fin no 
in our consolidated financial statements as of december  fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
fin no 
requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without financial support from other parties 
we do not have an interest in  nor are we affiliated with  any variable interest entities  and therefore  do not expect the adoption of fin no 
to have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents production imbalances we have gas production imbalance positions that are the result of partial interest owners selling more or less than their proportionate share of gas on jointly owned wells 
imbalances are generally settled by disproportionate gas sales over the remaining life of the well  or by cash payment by the overproduced party to the underproduced party 
we use the entitlement method of accounting for natural gas sales 
accordingly  revenue is deferred for gas deliveries in excess of our net revenue interest  while revenue is accrued for the undelivered volumes 
production imbalances are generally recorded at the estimated sales price in effect at the time of production 
the consolidated balance sheets include the following amounts related to production imbalances december in thousands amount mcf amount mcf accounts receivable current underproduction accounts payable current overproduction net current gas underproduction balancing receivable other assets noncurrent underproduction other long term liability noncurrent overproduction net long term gas overproduction balancing payable other assets noncurrent carbon dioxide underproduction net long term overproduction balancing payable forward looking statements certain information included in this annual report and other materials filed or to be filed by us with the securities and exchange commission  as well as information included in oral statements or other written statements made or to be made by us  contain projections and forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and section a of the securities act of  as amended  relating to our operations and the oil and gas industry 
such forward looking statements may be or may concern  among other things  capital expenditures  cash flow  drilling activity  drilling locations  acquisition and development activities  pricing differentials  operating costs  production activities  oil  gas and natural gas liquids reserves and prices  hedging activities and the results thereof  liquidity  debt repayment  regulatory matters and competition 
such forward looking statements are based on management s current plans  expectations  assumptions  projections and estimates and are identified by words such as expects  intends  plans  projects  predicts  anticipates  believes  estimates  goal  should  could  assume  and similar words that convey the uncertainty of future events 
these statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict 
therefore  actual results may differ materially from expectations  estimates  or assumptions expressed in  forecasted in  or implied in such forward looking statements 
some of the risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed below 
oil and gas price fluctuations 
our results of operations depend upon the prices we receive for our oil and gas 
historically  the markets for oil and gas have been volatile and are likely to remain volatile in the future 
we routinely hedge a portion of our production to reduce the effects of price volatility see hedging arrangements below 
otherwise  the prices we receive depend upon factors beyond our control  including political instability in oil producing regions  weather conditions  ability of opec to agree upon and maintain oil prices and production levels  consumer demand  worldwide economic conditions and the price and availability of alternative fuels 
moreover  government regulations  such as regulation of gas transportation and price controls  can affect product prices in the long term 
these external factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it difficult to reliably estimate future prices of oil and gas 
to the extent we have not hedged our production  any decline in oil and gas prices adversely affects our financial condition 
if the oil and gas industry experiences 
table of contents significant price declines  we may  among other things  be unable to meet our financial obligations or make planned capital expenditures 
debt level 
we have substantial debt and may incur more 
if we are unsuccessful in increasing production from existing reserves or developing new reserves  we may lack the funds to pay principal and interest on our debt obligations 
our indebtedness also affects our ability to finance future operations and capital needs and may preclude pursuit of other business opportunities 
capital requirements 
we make  and will continue to make  substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition  development  production  exploration and abandonment of our oil and gas reserves 
we intend to finance our capital expenditures primarily through cash flow from operations and bank borrowing 
lower oil and gas prices  however  reduce cash flow and the amount of credit available under our bank revolving credit facility 
competitive industry 
the oil and gas industry is highly competitive 
we compete with major oil companies  independent oil and gas businesses  and individual producers and operators  many of which have greater financial and other resources than us 
in addition  the industry as a whole competes with other industries which supply energy and fuel to industrial  commercial and other consumers 
many of our competitors have financial  technological and other resources substantially greater than ours 
these companies may be able to pay more for development prospects and productive oil and gas properties and may be able to define  evaluate  bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit 
our ability to develop and exploit our oil and gas properties and to acquire additional properties in the future will depend upon our ability to successfully conduct operations  implement advanced technologies  evaluate and select suitable properties and consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment 
reserve replacement 
our success depends upon finding  acquiring and developing oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable 
unless we are able to successfully explore for  develop or acquire proved reserves  our proved reserves will decline through depletion and our financial assets and annual revenues will decline unless prices substantially increase 
we cannot assure the success of our exploration  development and acquisition activities 
hedging arrangements 
to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in the prices of oil and gas  we currently and may in the future enter into hedging arrangements for a portion of our oil and gas production 
these hedging arrangements expose us to risk of financial loss in some circumstances  including when production is less than expected  the counterparty to the hedging contract defaults on its contract obligations  or there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the hedging agreements and actual prices received 
in addition  these hedging arrangements may limit the benefit we would otherwise receive from increases in prices for oil and gas 
reserve estimates 
estimating our proved reserves involves many uncertainties  including factors beyond our control 
petroleum engineers consider many factors and make assumptions in estimating oil and gas reserves and future net cash flows 
lower oil and gas prices generally cause lower estimates of proved reserves 
ultimately  actual production  revenues and expenditures relating to our reserves will vary from any estimates  and these variations may be material 
acquiring producing properties 
we constantly evaluate opportunities to acquire oil and gas properties and frequently engage in bidding and negotiation for these acquisitions 
if successful in this process  we may alter or increase our capitalization through the issuance of additional debt or equity securities  the sale of production payments or other measures 
any change in capitalization affects our risk profile 
acquisitions may also alter the nature of our business 
this could occur when the character of acquired properties is substantially different from our existing properties in terms of operating or geologic characteristics 
drilling activities 
our drilling activities subject us to many risks  including the risk that we will not find commercially productive reservoirs 
drilling for oil and gas can be unprofitable  not only from dry wells  but from productive wells that do not produce sufficient revenues to return a profit 
also  title problems  weather conditions  governmental requirements and shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment and services can delay our drilling operations or result in their cancellation 
the cost of drilling  completing and operating wells is often uncertain  and we cannot assure that new wells will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investment 

table of contents marketability of production 
the marketability of our production depends in part upon the availability  proximity and capacity of pipelines  gas gathering systems and processing facilities 
any significant change in market factors affecting these infrastructure facilities could harm our business 
we deliver oil and gas through gathering systems and pipelines that we do not own 
these facilities may not be available to us in the future 
growth through acquisitions 
our business strategy has emphasized growth through strategic acquisitions  but we may not be able to continue to identify properties for acquisition or we may not be able to make acquisitions on terms that we consider economically acceptable 
there is intense competition for acquisition opportunities in our industry 
competition for acquisitions may increase the cost of  or cause us to refrain from  completing acquisitions 
our strategy of completing acquisitions is dependent upon  among other things  our ability to obtain debt and equity financing and  in some cases  regulatory approvals 
our ability to pursue our growth strategy may be hindered if we are not able to obtain financing or regulatory approvals 
our ability to grow through acquisitions and manage growth will require us to continue to invest in operational  financial and management information systems and to attract  retain  motivate and effectively manage our employees 
the inability to effectively manage the integration of acquisitions could reduce our focus on subsequent acquisitions and current operations  which  in turn  could negatively impact our earnings and growth 
our financial position and results or operations may fluctuate significantly from period to period  based on whether or not significant acquisitions are completed in particular periods 
government regulations 
extensive federal  state and local regulation of the oil and gas industry significantly affects our operations 
in particular  our oil and gas exploration  development and production  and our storage and transportation of liquid hydrocarbons  are subject to stringent environmental regulations 
these regulations have increased the costs of planning  designing  drilling  installing  operating and abandoning oil and gas wells and other related facilities 
these regulations may become more demanding in the future 
we may need to expend significant financial and managerial resources to comply with environmental regulations and permitting requirements 
although we believe that our operations generally comply with applicable laws and regulations  we may incur substantial additional costs and liabilities in our operations as a result of stricter environmental laws  regulations and enforcement policies 
operating hazards and uninsured risks 
our operations are subject to inherent hazards and risks  such as fire  explosions  blowouts  formations with abnormal pressures  uncontrollable flows of underground gas  oil and formation water and environmental hazards such as gas leaks and oil spills 
any of these events could cause a loss of hydrocarbons  pollution or other environmental damage  clean up responsibilities  regulatory investigations and penalties  suspension of operations  personal injury claims  loss of life  damage to our properties  or damage to the property of others 
in addition  our liability for environmental hazards may include conditions created by the previous owners of properties that we purchase or lease or by acquired companies prior to the date we acquire them 
as protection against operating hazards  we maintain insurance coverage against some  but not all  potential losses 
we do not believe that insurance coverage for all environmental damages that could occur is available at a reasonable cost 
we believe that our insurance is adequate and customary for companies of similar size and operation  but losses could occur for uninsured risks or in amounts exceeding existing coverage 
the occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we only enter derivative financial instruments in conjunction with our hedging activities 
these instruments principally include commodity futures  collars  swaps and option agreements and interest rate swap agreements 
these financial and commodity based derivative contracts are used to limit the risks of fluctuations in interest rates and natural gas and crude oil prices 
gains and losses on these derivatives are generally offset by losses and gains on the respective hedged exposures 
our board of directors has adopted a policy governing the use of derivative instruments  which requires that all derivatives used by us relate to an underlying  offsetting position  anticipated transaction or firm commitment  and prohibits the use of speculative  highly complex or leveraged derivatives 
the policy also requires review and approval by the chairman  the executive vice president administration and the senior vice president marketing of all risk 
table of contents management programs using derivatives and all derivative transactions 
these programs are also reviewed at least annually by the board of directors 
hypothetical changes in interest rates and prices chosen for the following estimated sensitivity effects are considered to be reasonably possible near term changes generally based on consideration of past fluctuations for each risk category 
it is not possible to accurately predict future changes in interest rates and product prices 
accordingly  these hypothetical changes may not necessarily be an indicator of probable future fluctuations 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk on short term and long term debt carrying variable interest rates 
at december   our variable rate debt had a carrying value of million  which approximated its fair value  and our fixed rate debt had a carrying value of million and an approximate fair value of million 
we attempt to balance the benefit of lower cost variable rate debt that has inherent increased risk with more expensive fixed rate debt that has less market risk 
this is accomplished through a mix of bank debt with short term variable rates and fixed rate senior and subordinated debt  as well as the occasional use of interest rate swaps 
the following table shows the carrying amount and fair value of long term debt and interest rate swaps  and the hypothetical change in fair value that would result from a basis point change in interest rates 
unless otherwise noted  the hypothetical change in fair value could be a gain or a loss depending on whether interest rates increase or decrease 
in thousands carrying amount fair value hypothetical change in fair value december  long term debt a december  long term debt a interest rate swaps a a this is approximate gain in fair value of long term debt and loss in fair value of interest rate swaps from a basis point increase in interest rates 
because of the limitation in value caused by the call price of fixed rate debt  a basis point decrease in interest rates would not significantly affect fair value at december  or december  commodity price risk we hedge a portion of our price risks associated with our crude oil and natural gas sales 
as of december   we had outstanding gas futures contracts  swap agreements and gas basis swap agreements 
these contracts and agreements had a net fair value loss of approximately million at december  and a net fair value gain of million at december  of the december  fair value  a million loss has been determined based on the exchange trade value of nymex contracts and a million gain has been determined based on the broker bid and ask quotes for basis contracts 
these fair values approximate amounts confirmed by the counterparties 
as of december   outstanding oil futures contracts and differential swaps had a net fair value loss of million 
the aggregate effect of a hypothetical change in gas prices would result in a change of approximately million in the fair value of gas futures contracts and swap agreements at december  the aggregate effect of a hypothetical change in oil prices would result in a change of approximately million in the fair value of these oil futures contracts and differential swaps at december  see note to consolidated financial statements 
because most of our futures contracts and swap agreements have been designated as hedge derivatives  changes in their fair value generally are reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income until the 
table of contents related sale of production occurs 
at that time  the realized hedge derivative gain or loss is transferred to product revenues in the consolidated income statement 
we had a physical delivery contract to sell  mcf per day from through july at a price of approximately of the average nymex futures price for intermediate crude oil 
because this gas sales contract was priced based on crude oil  which is not clearly and closely associated with natural gas prices  it was accounted for as a non hedge derivative financial instrument 
this contract referred to as the enron btu swap contract was terminated in december in conjunction with the bankruptcy filing of enron corporation 
in november  we entered derivative contracts to effectively defer until and any cash flow impact related to  mcf of daily gas deliveries in that were to be made under the enron btu swap contract 
the net fair value loss on these contracts at december  was million 
the effect of a hypothetical change in gas prices would result in a change of approximately million in the fair value of these contracts  while a change in crude oil prices would result in a change of approximately million
