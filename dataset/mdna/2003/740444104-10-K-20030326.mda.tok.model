item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business environment the evolving regulatory environment in the energy and communication sectors over the last several years has forced the incumbent energy and communications service providers to share their networks with competitors 
the effect of this policy has been twofold 
it has discouraged start up businesses from building their own networks  instead allowing them to piggyback on incumbent networks at low costs 
meanwhile  incumbents bear the full burden of the cost of maintaining the networks that they are forced to share in the face of increased competition 
the result has severely limited the amount of capital these companies invest in both new construction and maintaining the existing infrastructure 
the regional bell telephone companies bells are the company s primary customers in the telecommunications market 
the recent federal communications commission fcc ruling dictated that these bells must continue leasing their lines to rivals such as worldcom and at t corp 
the bells claim that the lease rates are below their cost of providing service 
consequently  the incentive for the bells to increase capital investment is minimized 
however  the fcc eased the old regulation requiring the bells to share their high speed lines with their competitors 
this increases the possibility that the bells will become more aggressive in providing broadband equipment and lines to homes 
one of the major communication market sectors that was hit the hardest was the fiber optic infrastructure 
during the late s  a tremendous amount of fiber optic construction was driven by the assumption that capacity was required to manage an internet economy with endless potential for growth 
but by  it became apparent that such expectations were exaggerated  and dot com era optimism gave way to the realization that there was a major overbuild in the fiber optic infrastructure 
the boom in construction resulted in significant fiber capacity that was not being fully utilized 
current estimates show it may be years before this excess capacity is absorbed and additional construction projects get under way 
a worldwide telecom recession  added competition from the burgeoning cell phone industry  overblown expectations and optimism from the dot com era  a glut of fiber optic infrastructure and the irregularities in business practices of certain communications companies contributed to the contraction of this market over the last several years 
many of the company s customers in the energy and communications markets contend with very high debt burdens  which have resulted in numerous bankruptcies  employee reductions and shrinking capital budgets 
overview the company s results continued to deteriorate as a result of the foregoing and  in particular  the lack of capital spending in the energy  fiber optic cable  and telecommunications markets during net sales and the resulting gross profit decreased from the previous year 
sales in the asia pacific markets increased while sales in the north and south american marketplace decreased 
domestic sales accounted for approximately of the decrease in consolidated sales as the communications markets fiber optic and data communication continued to contract 
latin american sales accounted for approximately of the decrease as a result of the present governmental climate and the softness of their currency compared to the us dollar 
changes in translation rates accounted for a million reduction in sales 
during the third quarter of  the company recorded pre tax abandonment charges of million related to its european data communications operations 
this entails winding down a manufacturing operation  closing five sales offices  terminating leases and reducing personnel by approximately this action was taken as a result of the continuing decline in the global telecommunication and data communication markets and after failing to reach agreement on an acceptable selling price on product supplied to a significant foreign customer 
approximately million of the charge is related to asset write downs  of which million of inventory write offs were recorded in cost of products sold and million of write offs related to receivables were included in costs and expenses on the statements of consolidated operations 
the remaining million of the charge  included in cost of products sold and costs and expenses  relates to cash outlays for employee severance cost  cost of exiting leased facilities  the termination of other contractual obligations and transitional costs 
approximately 
million of the latter category of expenses was expended as of december   and the remaining cash outlays are anticipated to be completed by june  other unusual charges recorded during the year included a million asset impairment charge in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no  goodwill and other intangible assets  a charge of 
million to expense premiums paid in excess of cash surrender value on life insurance policies and a charge of 
million related to the cumulative translation adjustment for the abandoned operation 
these unusual charges  which the company believes to be one time charges  reduced pretax income by million and resulted in a reported loss of million or 
per share in during the third quarter of  the company recorded realignment charges related to its data communication business that resulted in a pre tax charge of million 
these charges related to abandoning a three year effort to enter the domestic market for local area network hubs and media converters and re evaluation of the strategy for penetrating the asia pacific market with its data communication products 
the pre tax charge of million consisted of million of inventory write offs included in cost of products sold  
million write down of assets included in costs and expenses  and 
million in severance payments  lease cancellations and related expenses included in costs and expenses 
the following table sets forth the company s summarized results of operations for and  deducting the unusual charges and realignment charges to arrive at amounts that are comparable 
see notes i and j in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of these charges 
these comparable results will be used to discuss results of operations compared to the company believes this presentation provides greater clarity of the impact of the unusual charges on reported results by caption  allowing for a more thorough discussion of the remaining fluctuations in the results of operations by the company s domestic and foreign segments 
year ended december  thousands of dollars  except per share data business reported unusual comparable reported realignment comparable results charges results results charges results net sales and income loss net sales     gross profit       costs and expenses selling     general and administrative      research and engineering     other operating income expense    asset impairment   royalty income net     operating income loss      other expense income loss before income tax      income tax      net income loss       per share amounts  basic and diluted net income loss results of operations compared to in consolidated net sales were million  a decrease of million  or  from domestic net sales of million decreased million  or  due primarily to the continued softness in the data communication market and the collapse of the fiber optic cable market 
lower sales volume accounted for the majority of this decrease 
the company does not anticipate a significant favorable change from the present conditions in the data communication  fiber optic cable and related communication markets in the near term 
although the current market has contracted significantly  the company believes that it has been able to maintain its market position by maintaining its existing customers while cultivating new ones 
the company believes that eventually the pent up requirement to repair  replace and upgrade the current domestic infrastructure in the energy and communication markets  together with the construction initiatives to connect homes and businesses to the fiber optic cable in order to recover initial investments made in the fiber infrastructure  will lead to an expansion in the fiber optic  telecommunication  and energy markets served by the company 
the company is developing several new products and modifying existing products in order to take advantage of the anticipated communication market expansion 
however  no assurance can be given as to when the anticipated demand will materialize or that it will materialize at all 
foreign net sales of million decreased million  or  compared to last year 
a decrease in sales in latin american countries as a result of governmental reductions of capital expenditures for the improvement and expansion of communication and energy grids accounted for of the decrease in foreign sales 
the weakening of certain latin american currencies against the us dollar accounted for of the decrease in foreign sales 
these sales decreases  coupled with million lower foreign data communication sales  were partially offset by sales increases in the asia pacific and western european regions 
no individual foreign country accounted for or more of the company s consolidated net sales 
presently  the latin american economic and political environment continues to be of concern and the company has taken initiatives to reduce its cost structure in that region until the market recovers 
as a result of the depressed latin american market and the abandonment of the european data communications operations in  the company s foreign sales are anticipated to decline by approximately 
gross profit of million for declined million  or  compared to this decrease is primarily the result of lower sales 
domestic gross profit decreased million and foreign gross profit decreased million compared to the previous year 
improvements in domestic manufacturing efficiencies and cost containment initiatives slightly improved the gross profit as a percent of sales

million reduction in commissions on lower sales  a million decrease related to a reduction in employment levels and a 
million reduction in advertising and sales promotion 
general and administrative expense increased 
million to million compared to million in this increase was due to an increase in bad debt expense of million offset by decreased professional fees of 
million relating to registering the company s common shares with the securities and exchange commission during the increase in bad debt expense was attributable to several telecommunication customers declaring bankruptcy during research and engineering expense of million represents a decrease of 
million from principally as a result of employee reductions 
other operating income of 
million improved million from  primarily as a result of lower goodwill and intangible asset amortization of million  as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
foreign costs and expenses decreased to million or million  when compared to the stronger dollar favorably impacted costs and expenses by 
million when foreign costs in local currency were translated to us dollars

lower commissions as a result of lower sales accounted for approximately one half of this decrease 
general and administrative expenses of million decreased 
million due to employment reductions and other costs reduction efforts 
other operating expense increased 
million primarily as a result of the gain on disposal of assets being reduced by 
million when compared to royalty income for the year ended december  of million is 
million lower than as a result of the decline in the domestic data communication market 
operating income of million for the year ended december  decreased million  or  compared to the previous year 
this decrease was primarily a result of the million decrease in gross profit  the decrease in royalty income of 
million offset by the million reduction in costs and expenses 
domestic operating income decreased million to million in as a result of million lower gross profit and the 
million reduction in royalty income partially offset by the million reduction in domestic costs and expenses 
foreign operating income of million decreased million compared to the previous year primarily due to the million decrease in gross profit partially offset by the million reduction in costs and expenses 
the company s foreign operating income includes million in income from china partially offset by operating losses of million in latin america and 
million in the european data communications operations 
the operating income attributable to china included the positive effect of a tax holiday see note f in the notes to consolidated financial statements  which will not be in effect to the same degree in and future years  and two major projects 
there can be no assurance that the company will sell products for similar projects during other expense for the year ended december  of 
million remained relatively unchanged from because a 
million reduction in interest expense resulting from lower debt was offset by a 
million decrease in interest income primarily due to interest received in on a one time state tax refund and a 
million reduction in foreign joint venture equity income 
income tax for the year ended december  of million was 
million lower than the prior year

the volume decrease was attributable to softness in the domestic market for both the company s data communication and formed wire products 
although the company cannot quantify the amount  it believes the events of september th exacerbated an already slowing north american economy 
the company s fourth quarter revenues of million were below those of the fourth quarter and the third quarter of foreign net sales increased million  or  primarily as a result of higher volumes 
the stronger dollar in had a negative impact of million when foreign sales were converted from native currency to us dollars 
excluding the impact of foreign currency  foreign sales would have increased by and consolidated sales would have decreased by only 
gross profit declined million  or  in compared to this decrease was primarily attributable to lower sales  including the impact of the stronger dollar 
costs and expenses of million increased million  or  over expenses related to the introduction of the company s data communication products to foreign markets accounted for approximately of this increase while approximately of the increase was the result of the business realignment charge 
the rest of the increase was due to general increases including expenses associated with moving a plant in mexico and fees associated with registering the company s common shares with the securities and exchange commission and listing the company s common shares on the nasdaq 
royalty income of million decreased 
million from as a result of higher foreign data communication royalty expense

for compared to in earnings per share for would have been if the realignment charge was excluded 
working capital  liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million for despite a million net loss

additionally  working capital was reduced by million 
net cash used in investing activities was million in during  the company sold the land and building of its former birmingham foundry

at december   the company had open uncompleted purchase commitments for inventory and capital equipment of 
million 
the company is continually analyzing potential acquisition candidates and business alternatives but has no commitments that would materially impact the operations of the business 
in addition  the company has announced that it is pursuing strategic alternatives with respect to its domestic data communication operations 
cash used in financing activities was million in this consisted primarily of a reduction in debt of million and dividend payments of million 
the company has commitments under operating leases primarily for office and manufacturing space  transportation equipment and computer equipment 
see note e in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on the future minimal rental commitment under these leasing arrangements 
one such lease is for the company s aircraft with a lease commitment through april under the terms  the company maintains the risk for the residual value in excess of the market value for the aircraft 
at the present time  the company believes its risks  if any  to be immaterial because the estimated market value of the aircraft approximates its residual value 
the company has evaluated its long term borrowing requirements and completed amending its main credit facility 
the bank approved the renewal of the credit facility and the company s board of directors approved the new amendment during the company s amendment to its primary revolving credit agreement matures december  the new amendment replaces the million revolving credit agreement that would have expired on december  with a million commitment

the company s financial position remains strong and its current ratio at december  was compared to at december  at december   the company s unused balance under its main credit facility was million and its debt to equity percentage was 
although the company believes its existing credit facilities  internally generated funds and ability to obtain additional financing will be sufficient to meet the company s growth and operating needs for the next months there are inherent risks related to each of these sources 
funds generated from continuing operations are contingent upon the general economy remaining flat or improving and the recovery of the energy and telecommunication market sectors in particular

 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  under the new rules  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests 
other intangibles continue to be amortized over their useful lives and will be assessed for impairment under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company has adopted sfas no 
as of january  consequently  the company discontinued the amortization of goodwill during under this statement  goodwill will be tested annually for impairment or if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the goodwill of a reporting unit might be impaired 
the company does not have any intangibles with indefinite lives except for goodwill 
during the fourth quarter of  the company performed an interim goodwill impairment test pursuant to sfas no 
the test was performed on one of the company s domestic reporting units 
to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit  management made estimates and judgements about future cash flows based on assumptions consistent with the company s long range plans 
in addition  the company used information obtained through market mechanisms to ascertain the fair value of its reporting unit 
based on the results of this analysis  it was determined that the goodwill of this reporting unit was fully impaired  and accordingly the company recorded an asset impairment charge of million 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  this statement nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring

the company has adopted the applicable disclosure provisions of fin in the financial statements and does not believe the adoption of the remaining provisions will have a significant effect on the financial statements 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgment and uncertainties  and potentially may result in materially different outcomes under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes that the critical accounting policies are limited to those that are described below 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the company records estimated allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable based upon the number of days the accounts are past due  the current business environment  and specific information such as bankruptcy or liquidity issues of customers 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
during the company recorded additional allowances for doubtful accounts of million and at december  the allowance represents of its trade receivables  compared to at december  sales returns and allowances the company records a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product and service related sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns and other known factors  such as open authorized returns 
at december  and  these provisions accounted for less than 
of consolidated net sales 
if future returns do not reflect the historical data the company uses to calculate these estimates  additional allowances or reversals of established allowances may be required 
excess and obsolescence reserves the company has provided an allowance for excess inventory and obsolescence based on estimates of future demand  which is subject to change 
additionally  discrete provisions are made when facts and circumstances indicate that particular inventories will not be utilized 
at december  the allowance for excess inventory and obsolescence was of gross inventories  compared to at december  if actual market conditions are different than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs or reversals of existing reserves may be necessary 
investments the company accounts for investments in two joint ventures in japan under the equity method of accounting 
the company records an investment impairment charge when it believes that an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in the investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
impairment of long lived assets the company records impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying value of those items 
the company s cash flows are based on historical results adjusted to reflect the best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
the net carrying value of assets not recoverable is then reduced to fair value 
the estimates of fair value represent the best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 
goodwill in adopting sfas no 
 the company performed its initial annual impairment tests for goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives utilizing a discounted cash flow methodology  market comparables  and an overall market capitalization reasonableness test in computing fair value by reporting unit 
the company engaged a third party to evaluate the model used in the fair value calculations 
the company then compared the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value to assess if goodwill and other indefinite live intangibles have been impaired 
based on the assumptions as to growth  discount rates and the weighting used for each respective valuation methodology  results of the valuations could be significantly changed 
however  the company believes that the methodologies and weightings used are reasonable and result in appropriate fair values of the reporting units 
the company performs interim impairment tests if trigger events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
during the fourth quarter  it became evident that the market valuation of one such domestic reporting unit had decreased  such that it was highly probable that the related goodwill would not be recoverable 
therefore  at december   the company has recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million 
warranty reserves the company establishes a warranty reserve when a known measurable potential exposure exists 
in addition  such reserves are adjusted for management s best estimate of warranty obligations based on current and historical trends 
should actual product failures and related costs to correct such product failures differ from management s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
at december  and  the company s warranty reserve was less than 
million 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company operates manufacturing facilities and offices around the world and uses fixed and floating rate debt to finance the company s global operations 
as a result  the company is subject to business risks inherent in non us activities  including political and economic uncertainty  import and export limitations and market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company believes the political and economic risks related to the company s foreign operations are mitigated due to the stability of the countries in which the company s largest foreign operations are located 
although the company does not regularly enter into derivative financial instruments  it has two foreign currency forward exchange contracts outstanding at december  whose fair value and carrying value are immaterial 
the company does not hold derivatives for trading purposes 
the company is exposed to market risk  including changes in interest rates 
the company is subject to interest rate risk on its variable rate revolving credit facilities  which consisted of borrowings of million at december  a basis point increase in the interest rate would have resulted in an increase in interest expense of approximately 
million for the year ended december  the company s primary currency rate exposures are related to foreign denominated debt  intercompany debt and cash and short term investments 
a hypothetical change in currency rates would have a favorable unfavorable impact on fair values of million and on income before tax of 
million
