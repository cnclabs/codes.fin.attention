item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion below should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes  which are included in this report  and the risk factors information in the business section of this report 
overview we began our domestic operations in as a designer and manufacturer of quiksilver branded boardshorts designed for the sport of surfing 
we grew our business through the late s by expanding our quiksilver products into a full range of sportswear  and we bought our us trademark from the quiksilver brand s australian founders in the distribution of our products was primarily through surf shops 
since the early s  we have diversified and grown our business by increased sales of our quiksilver product line  the creation of new brands such as roxy  the introduction of new products  the development of our retail operations  and acquisitions 
we acquired the quiksilver licensee in europe in to expand geographically  we purchased quiksilver international in to gain global ownership of the quiksilver brand  and we acquired quiksilver asia pacific at the end of to unify our global operating platform 
we also acquired various other smaller businesses and brands 
brand building has been a key to our growth  and we have always maintained our roots in the boardriding lifestyle 
today our products are sold throughout the world  primarily in surf shops and specialty stores that provide an authentic retail experience for our customers 
over the last five years  our revenues have grown from approximately million in fiscal to approximately million in fiscal we design  produce and distribute clothing  accessories and related products exclusively in the consumer products industry 
for fiscal  we had two geographic segments  domestic and europe 
as a result of our recent acquisition  we will have a third geographic segment beginning in fiscal  asia pacific 
the domestic segment includes revenues from the us  canada and other exports from the us  as well as royalties earned from various licenses in international territories and from licenses for the design and distribution of certain products such as eyewear 
the european segment includes revenues primarily from western europe 
years ended october  in thousands domestic revenues european revenues total revenues we operate in markets that are highly competitive  and our ability to evaluate and respond to changing consumer demands and tastes is critical to our success 
shifts in consumer preferences could have a negative effect on companies that misjudge these preferences 
we believe that our historical success is due to the development of an experienced team of designers  artists  sponsored athletes  merchandisers  pattern makers  and cutting and sewing contractors 
it s this team and the heritage and current strength of our brands that has helped us remain in the forefront of design in our markets 
our success in the future will depend on our ability to continue to design products that are acceptable to the marketplace 
there can be no assurance that we can do this 
the consumer products industry is fragmented  and in order to retain and or grow our market share  we must continue to be competitive in the areas of quality  brand image  distribution methods  price  customer service  and intellectual property protection 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
to prepare these financial statements  we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
these estimates also affect our reported revenues and expenses 
judgments must also be made about the disclosure of contingent liabilities 
actual results could be significantly different from these estimates 
we 
table of contents believe that the following discussion addresses the significant accounting policies that are the most critical to help fully understand and evaluate our reported financial results 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized when the risk of ownership and title passes to our customers 
generally  we extend credit to our customers and do not require collateral 
our payment terms range from net to net  depending on the country or whether we sell directly to retailers in the country or to a distributor 
none of our sales agreements with any of our customers provide for any rights of return 
however  we do approve returns on a case by case basis at our sole discretion to protect our brands and our image 
we provide allowances for estimated returns when revenues are recorded  and related losses have historically been within our expectations 
if returns are higher than our estimates  our earnings would be adversely affected 
accounts receivable it is not uncommon for some of our customers to have financial difficulties from time to time 
this is normal given the wide variety of our account base  which includes small surf shops  medium sized retail chains  and some large department store chains 
throughout the year  we perform credit evaluations of our customers  and we adjust credit limits based on payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness 
we continuously monitor our collections and maintain a reserve for estimated credit losses based on our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
historically  our losses have been consistent with our estimates  but there can be no assurance that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have experienced in the past 
unforeseen  material financial difficulties of our customers could have an adverse impact on our profits 
inventories we value inventories at the cost to purchase and or manufacture the product or the current estimated market value of the inventory  whichever is lower 
we regularly review our inventory quantities on hand  and we record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on estimated forecasts of product demand and market value 
demand for our products could fluctuate significantly  which was evident in the aftermath of september th 
the demand for our products could be negatively affected by many factors  including the following weakening economic conditions  further terrorist acts or threats  unanticipated changes in consumer preferences  reduced customer confidence in the retail market  and unseasonable weather 
some of these factors could also interrupt the production and or importation of our products or otherwise increase the cost of our products 
as a result  our operations and financial performance could be negatively affected 
additionally  our estimates of product demand and or market value could be inaccurate  which could result in an understated or overstated provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
long lived assets we acquire tangible and intangible assets in the normal course of our business 
we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of these long lived assets including fixed assets  trademarks and goodwill at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
an impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected future cash flows derived from an asset are less than its carrying amount 
impairments  if any  would be recognized in operating earnings 
we continually use judgment when applying these impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment tests  the undiscounted cash flows used to assess impairments  and the fair value of a potentially impaired asset 
the reasonableness of our judgment could significantly affect the carrying value of our long lived assets 

table of contents income taxes current income tax expense is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable for the current year 
a deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the expected future consequences of temporary differences in the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the value of our deferred tax assets 
if we determine that it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized  we would reduce the value of these assets to their expected realizable value  thereby decreasing net income 
evaluating the value of these assets is necessarily based on our judgment 
if we subsequently determined that the deferred tax assets  which had been written down would  in our judgment  be realized in the future  the value of the deferred tax assets would be increased  thereby increasing net income in the period when that determination was made 
foreign currency translation a significant portion of our revenues are generated in europe  where we operate with the euro as our functional currency 
our european revenues in the united kingdom are denominated in british pounds and some european product is sourced in us dollars  both of which result in exposure to gains and losses that could occur from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
we also have other foreign currency obligations related to our acquisition of quiksilver international 
our assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange on the balance sheet date 
revenues and expenses are translated using the average exchange rate for the period 
gains and losses from translation of foreign subsidiary financial statements are included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss 
as part of our overall strategy to manage our level of exposure to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  we enter into various foreign exchange contracts generally in the form of forward contracts 
for all contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges  we record the changes in the fair value of the derivatives in other comprehensive income 
we also use other derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting to mitigate our exposure to currency risks 
these derivatives are marked to fair value with corresponding gains or losses recorded in earnings 
results of operations the table below shows the components in our statements of income as a percentage of revenues years ended october  revenues gross profit selling  general and administrative expense operating income interest expense foreign currency and other expense income before provision for income taxes fiscal compared to fiscal revenues revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal primarily as a result of increased unit sales and new products 
of those totals  domestic revenues increased to million from million  and european revenues increased to million from million 

table of contents domestic revenues in our men s category  which includes quiksilver young men s  boys  toddlers  wintersports  quiksilveredition  hawk clothing and fidra  increased to million in fiscal from million the year before 
domestic revenues in our women s category  which includes roxy  roxy girl  teenie wahine  raisins  leilani and radio fiji  increased to million from million for those same periods 
wintersports hardgoods are sold under the lib technologies  gnu  supernatural mfg 
and bent metal brands and totaled million in fiscal compared to million in the previous year 
royalty income decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal revenues in the domestic men s category increased generally across all divisions 
the women s increase came from both the roxy and raisins divisions 
we believe that our product design and marketing efforts are resulting in increased consumer demand for our products in the domestic market 
royalty income decreased because we acquired our domestic outlet store licensee during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year and terminated our domestic watch licensee 
also  we acquired the business of our australian and japanese licensees in the first quarter of fiscal  which eliminates the related royalty income stream going forward 
accordingly  we expect royalty income to decline in fiscal compared to fiscal however  this decline would be more than offset in fiscal by the increased product shipment revenues from the acquired business 
european revenues were approximately of the consolidated total in fiscal in us dollars  revenues in the men s category increased to million in fiscal from million in the previous year 
women s revenues increased to million from million for those same periods 
revenue growth was the largest in the united kingdom  france and spain 
we believe that our product design and marketing efforts are resulting in increased consumer demand for our products in the european market 
for consolidated financial statement reporting  euro results must be translated into us dollar amounts at average exchange rates  but this can distort performance when exchange rates change from year to year 
to understand our european fiscal growth and better assess competitive performance and market share gains  it is important to look at revenues in euros as well  which is our operational currency in europe 
in euros  revenues grew in fiscal this is lower than the growth rate in us dollars because the us dollar was worth fewer euros on average in fiscal compared to fiscal gross profit our consolidated gross profit margin increased to in fiscal from in the previous year 
the domestic gross profit margin increased to from  while our european gross profit margin increased to from 
the majority of the domestic gross profit margin improvement was related to events in the prior year 
we recorded a million writedown in the carrying value of our domestic inventory in the fourth quarter of fiscal in the aftermath of september   the market for consumer products  including casual lifestyle apparel  experienced a dramatic falloff in demand and resulted in a substantial amount of customer order cancellations 
this phenomenon created an industry wide glut of excess product available to the traditional off price channel thereby driving the price of certain seasonal product below cost 
accordingly  a reduction in the carrying value of our domestic inventories was required 
we had no such reduction in fiscal the domestic gross profit margin improved in the second half fiscal because we lowered inventory levels toward the end of the year 
consequently  our end of season clearance business was down compared to the year before  and our gross margins on those sales were up 
this offset lower domestic gross margins on sales of end of season inventories in the first half of the year 
we anticipate that our domestic gross margins will be higher for the first part of fiscal compared to the prior year periods 
our european gross profit margin increased primarily due to lower production costs 
additionally  both the domestic and european gross profit margins improved because we had a higher percentage of our sales through company owned retail stores 
we earn higher gross margins on sales in company owned stores  but these higher gross margins are offset by store operating costs 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense increased to million in fiscal from million in the previous year 
domestically  it increased to million from million and in europe it increased to million from million for those same periods 
higher personnel costs and other costs related to increased sales volume were the primary reasons for these increases 
as a percentage of revenues  selling general and administrative expense increased to in fiscal from 
table of contents in fiscal selling  general and administrative expense increased as a percentage of revenues primarily due to the incremental operating costs of new company owned retail stores 
interest expense and income taxes interest expense in fiscal decreased to million from million in the previous year 
this decrease was due primarily to lower average balances on the company s domestic debt and lower domestic interest rates compared to the previous year 
the company s income tax rate decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal this improvement resulted primarily because a higher percentage of our fiscal profits were generated in countries with lower tax rates 
our rate also decreased because we adopted sfas no 
during fiscal and discontinued the amortization of certain intangible assets  which was not tax deductible 
net income net income in fiscal totaled million or per share on a diluted basis 
in the previous year  net income was million or per share on a diluted basis 
basic earnings per share amounted to for fiscal compared to for fiscal results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal revenues revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal domestic revenues increased to million from million  and european revenues increased to million from million 
domestic revenues in our men s category increased to million in fiscal from million the year before 
domestic revenues in our women s category increased to million from million for those same periods 
wintersports hardgoods totaled million in fiscal compared to million in the previous year 
revenues in our domestic men s category increased generally across all divisions 
the increase in our women s category was the result of increases in both the roxy and raisins divisions 
we believe that our product design and marketing efforts resulted in increased consumer demand for our products 
royalty income totaled million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this increase reflects our ownership of quiksilver international for the full fiscal year in european revenues represented approximately of our total net sales in fiscal revenue growth was the largest in france  the united kingdom and spain 
in us dollars  revenues in our men s category increased to million in fiscal from million in the previous year 
revenues in our women s category increased to million from million for those same periods 
in euros  revenues grew in fiscal this is higher than the growth rate in us dollars because the us dollar was worth more euros in fiscal compared to fiscal gross profit our consolidated gross profit margin decreased to in fiscal from in the previous year 
our domestic gross profit margin decreased to from  while our european gross profit margin decreased slightly to from 
the domestic gross profit margin decreased primarily as a result of a million writedown in the carrying value of our inventory 
in the aftermath of september   the market for consumer products  including casual lifestyle apparel  experienced a dramatic falloff in demand and resulted in a substantial amount of customer order cancellations 
this phenomenon created an industry wide glut of excess product available to the traditional off price channel thereby driving the price of certain seasonal product below cost 
accordingly  a reduction in the carrying value of our domestic inventories was required 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expense increased in fiscal to million from million in the previous year 
domestically  it increased to million from million  and in europe it increased to million from million in those same periods 
higher personnel and other costs related to increased sales volume were the primary reasons for these increases 
as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expense increased to in fiscal from in fiscal this increase as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to the incremental operating costs of new company owned retail stores and to the operating costs of quiksilver international  which was acquired in the third quarter of fiscal interest expense and income taxes interest expense increased to million in fiscal from million in the previous year 
approximately million was related to debt arising from our acquisition of quiksilver international 
the remainder of the increase was primarily from additional borrowings to provide working capital to support our growth and continued investment in retail stores 
our income tax rate for fiscal decreased to from in fiscal this reduction resulted primarily because a higher percentage of our profits were generated in countries with lower tax rates 
net income net income in fiscal totaled million or per share on a diluted basis 
in the previous year  net income was million or per share on a diluted basis 
basic earnings per share amounted to for fiscal compared to for fiscal financial position  capital resources and liquidity we finance our working capital needs and capital investments with operating cash flows and bank revolving lines of credit 
multiple banks in the us  europe and  now  australia  make these lines of credit available 
term loans are also used to supplement these lines of credit and are typically used to finance long term assets 
cash and cash equivalents totaled million at october  versus million at october  working capital amounted to million at october   compared to million at october   an increase of 
our strategy is to keep cash balances low and maintain adequate liquidity in our credit facilities to supplement operating cash flows as needed 
we believe that our current cash flows and credit facilities are adequate to cover our cash needs at least for the next twelve months 
furthermore  we believe that increases in our credit facilities can be obtained if needed to fund future growth 
operating cash flows we generated million from operations in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this million improvement resulted from several factors 
the largest factor was the decrease in inventories 
we used million in fiscal as inventories increased and accounts payable decreased 
by contrast  we generated million in fiscal as inventories decreased and trade accounts payable increased  an improvement of million 
cash flows increased by million from higher net income adjusted for noncash expenses  and accounts receivable increased at a slower rate  resulting in an million improvement 
the increases in accrued liabilities and income taxes payable resulted in an additional million of positive cash flows compared to the year before 
we generated million from operations in fiscal compared to using million of cash in fiscal the amount of net income plus noncash expenses was comparable in fiscal and fiscal and although cash invested in inventories exceeded the prior year by million net of the accounts payable decrease  the increase in trade accounts receivable was million less in fiscal these factors resulted in a million improvement in operating cash flows in fiscal over the previous year 

table of contents capital expenditures we have avoided high levels of capital expenditures for our manufacturing functions by using independent contractors for sewing and other processes such as washing  dyeing and embroidery 
we perform the cutting process in house domestically to enhance control and efficiency  and we screenprint a portion of our product in house both domestically and in europe 
fiscal capital expenditures were million  which was comparable to the million we spent in fiscal and million higher than the million spent in fiscal in fiscal and  we increased our investment in company owned retail stores 
we also expanded our facilities in europe in fiscal investments in warehouse equipment  computer equipment and fixtures also continued in fiscal new company owned retail stores are again part of our plans in fiscal computer hardware and software will also be added to continuously improve systems 
capital spending for these and other projects in fiscal is expected to range between million and million 
acquisitions shortly after the end of fiscal  we acquired our licensees in australia and japan to unify our global operating platform 
the transaction date was december  we refer to the operations of this group of companies  which constitutes a new geographic segment for us  as quiksilver asia pacific 
the group includes two australian companies  ug manufacturing co 
pty ltd 
and qsj holdings pty ltd  and one japanese company  quiksilver japan kk 
ug manufacturing co 
pty ltd 
was still owned by the founders of the quiksilver brand and was the original quiksilver operating company that has been producing quiksilver products in australia and surrounding countries and territories for over years 
along with a japanese partner  the founders also started quiksilver japan kk  which has been the quiksilver licensee in japan for approximately years 
we also acquired a interest in our turkish licensee as part of the transaction 
the asia pacific operations will be included in our results beginning with the effective date of the acquisition in the first quarter of our fiscal year ending october  the initial purchase price includes cash of million and million shares of our common stock valued at million 
the initial purchase price is subject to adjustment based on the acquired entities closing balance sheets  which are expected to be finalized in the second quarter of fiscal the sellers are entitled to future payments ranging from zero to million if certain sales and earnings targets are achieved during the three years ending october  the amount of goodwill we initially recorded for the transaction will increase if such contingent payments are made 
effective september   we acquired beach street  inc  a company that operates quiksilver outlet stores 
the acquisition of beach street is expected to increase our control over our brands and distribution and is expected to enable us to capture some incremental gross margin 
we issued  shares of common stock valued at million as consideration for the acquisition 
effective july   we acquired quiksilver international  an australian company that owns the worldwide trademark rights to the quiksilver brand name other than in the united states and mexico where those rights were already owned by us 
the initial acquisition payment was million  which included cash consideration of million and transaction costs  net of imputed interest  of million 
under the terms of the purchase agreement  two additional payments were to be made 
one was made at the end of fiscal  and another is to be made at the end of fiscal these additional payments  which are denominated in australian dollars  are contingent on the computed earnings of quiksilver international through june   subject to specified minimums 
the deferred minimum purchase price payments  which were discounted to present value  totaled million at the date of the acquisition and were included as a component of the purchase price recorded at july  the payment made at the end of fiscal was increased by million  with a corresponding increase to trademarks  as a result of quiksilver international s operations for the two years ended june   resulting in a total payment of million 
the obligation related to the remaining deferred purchase price payment is reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as a component of debt 
we believe that we have benefited and will continue to benefit from unified ownership of the quiksilver brand worldwide 
global product decisions can be controlled by us  and the opportunities for coordinated global sourcing and marketing programs are enhanced 

table of contents debt structure a syndication of us banks finances our domestic business  and european banks finance our european business 
australian banks finance our new asia pacific business 
our debt structure includes short term lines of credit and long term loans as follows october  in thousands domestic syndicated line of credit european short term credit arrangements domestic syndicated term loan domestic term loan european long term debt deferred purchase price obligation total debt the domestic credit facility includes a term loan and a revolving line of credit facility that totals million 
the line of credit expires on june   and it bears interest based on the agent bank s reference rate or libor 
the weighted average interest rate at october  was 
the term loan is repayable in equal quarterly installments through october and amounted to million at october  the term loan bears interest contractually based on libor 
however  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to fix the interest rate at per year 
this swap agreement is effective through october and is an effective hedge of the related interest rate exposure 
the line of credit and the term loan are secured and are subject to generally the same restrictive covenants 
the most significant covenants relate to maintaining certain leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios 
the payment of dividends is restricted  among other things  and our assets  other than trademarks and other intellectual property  generally have been pledged as collateral 
at october   we were in compliance with such covenants 
we believe that the line of credit will be renewed with substantially similar terms 
we also have another domestic term loan with a single bank that amounted to million on october  and is repayable in installments of million per month with a final balloon payment due on october  we anticipate that these monthly payments and final balloon payment will be paid from borrowings on our revolving line of credit facility 
this term loan was established in april and is secured by the leasehold improvements at our headquarters in huntington beach  california 
the interest rate structure and restrictive covenants are substantially the same as those under the syndicated credit facility 
however  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to fix the interest rate at per year 
this swap agreement is effective through april and is an effective hedge of the related interest rate exposure 
in europe  we have arrangements with several banks that provide approximately million for cash borrowings and approximately million for letters of credit 
at october   related interest rates ranged from to 
these lines of credit expire on various dates through april  and we believe that the banks will continue to make these facilities available with substantially similar terms 
the amount outstanding on these lines of credit at october  was million at an average interest rate of 
in europe  we also have million of long term debt  most of which is collateralized by fixed assets 
this debt bears interest at rates ranging generally from to 
required principal and interest payments are either monthly  quarterly or annually  and the loans are due at various dates through our financing activities used million of cash in fiscal as debt was reduced 
this compares to million provided in the previous year and million in fiscal as funds were borrowed 
we used these borrowings to fund the business acquisitions  capital expenditures and the inventory investments discussed above 

table of contents contractual obligations and commitments we lease certain land and buildings under non cancelable operating leases 
the leases expire at various dates through  excluding extensions at our option  and contain various provisions for rental adjustments including  in certain cases  adjustments based on increases in the consumer price index 
the leases generally contain renewal provisions for varying periods of time 
we also have long term debt and obligations related to business acquisitions 
additional payments to the sellers  ranging from zero to million  could be required for our acquisition of quiksilver asia pacific if certain sales and earnings targets are achieved 
our deferred purchase price obligation related to our acquisition of quiksilver international could increase based on the computed earnings of quiksilver international through june our significant contractual obligations and commitments as of october  are summarized in the following table payments due by period two to four to after one three five five in thousands year years years years total minimum lease payments domestic syndicated term loan domestic term loan european long term debt deferred purchase price obligation we have domestic and european short term line of credit commitments that allow for maximum cash borrowings and letters of credit of million 
these commitments expire in fiscal we had million of borrowings drawn on these lines of credit as of october   and letters of credit issued at that time totaled million 
trade accounts receivable and inventories our trade accounts receivable were million at october  versus million the previous year  an increase of 
of those totals  domestic receivables decreased to million compared to million  and european receivables increased to million from million 
the growth in european receivables was generally consistent with the increase in european revenues 
however  domestic receivables decreased even though revenues increased primarily because of improved collections and the elimination of certain trade accounts receivable when we acquired our domestic outlet store licensee  beach street  inc  in september inventories decreased to million at october  from million the year before 
the domestic component decreased to million from million  and the european piece increased to million from million 
our average inventory turnover was times at the end of fiscal based on a rolling average computation compared to average turnover of times at the end of the previous year 
inflation inflation has been modest during the years covered by this report 
accordingly  inflation has had an insignificant impact on our sales and profits 
new accounting pronouncements effective november   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations 
this standard eliminates the pooling method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  in addition  sfas no 
addresses the accounting for intangible assets and goodwill acquired in a business combination 
this portion of sfas no 
is effective for business combinations completed after june  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents effective november   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  which revises the accounting for purchased goodwill and intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are tested for impairment annually and also in the event of an impairment indicator 
an impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected future cash flows derived from an asset are less than its carrying amount 
impairments  if any  would be recognized in operating earnings 
we completed the required transitional impairment test and the annual impairment test and determined that no impairment loss was necessary 
any subsequent impairment losses will be reflected in operating income 
with the adoption of sfas no 
we discontinued amortization of goodwill and certain trademarks that were determined to have an indefinite life 
had amortization of goodwill and these trademarks not been recorded in year ended october   net income would have increased by million  net of taxes  and diluted earnings per share would have increased by 
likewise  net income would have increased by million  net of taxes  in fiscal  and diluted earnings per share would have increased by 
in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes previous guidance on financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and for segments of a business to be disposed of 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
however  future impairment reviews may result in charges against earnings to write down the value of long lived assets 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which requires that costs associated with exit or disposal activities be recognized when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
we must apply sfas no 
prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december  if we initiate exit or disposal activities after that date  sfas no 
will affect the timing of the recognition of the related costs 
we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
we are required to follow the prescribed format and provide the additional disclosures required by sfas no 
in our financial statements for fiscal and must also provide the disclosures in our quarterly reports containing condensed financial statements for interim periods beginning with our quarterly period ending april  forward looking statements certain words in this report like believes  anticipates  expects  estimates and similar expressions are intended to identify  in certain cases  forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from the predicted results 
such factors include  among others  the following 
table of contents general economic and business conditions the acceptance in the marketplace of new products the availability of outside contractors at prices favorable to us the ability to source raw materials at prices favorable to us currency fluctuations changes in business strategy or development plans availability of qualified personnel changes in political  social and economic conditions and local regulations  particularly in europe and asia other factors outlined in our previously filed public documents  copies of which may be obtained without cost from us 
given these uncertainties  investors are cautioned not to place too much weight on such statements 
we are not obligated to update these forward looking statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we are exposed to a variety of risks 
two of these risks are foreign currency fluctuations and changes in interest rates that affect interest expense 
see also note to our financial statements 
foreign currency and derivatives we are exposed to gains and losses resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relating to certain sales  royalty income  and product purchases of our international subsidiaries that are denominated in currencies other than their functional currencies 
we are also exposed to foreign currency gains and losses resulting from domestic transactions that are not denominated in us dollars  and to fluctuations in interest rates related to our variable rate debt 
furthermore  we are exposed to gains and losses resulting from the effect that fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have on the reported results in our consolidated financial statements due to the translation of the operating results and financial position of our international subsidiaries 
we use various foreign currency exchange contracts and intercompany loans as part of our overall strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  we use interest rate swaps to manage our exposure to the risk of fluctuations in interest rates 
changes in the fair value of the derivatives for all qualifying cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income 
other derivatives not qualifying for hedge accounting but used to mitigate exposure to currency risks are marked to fair value with corresponding gains or losses recorded in earnings 
as of october   we were hedging forecasted transactions expected to occur in the following eight months 
assuming exchange rates at october  remain constant  we expect million of losses related to hedges of these transactions to be reclassed into earnings over the next eight months 
also included in accumulated other comprehensive income at october  is a million net charge related to cash flow hedges of our long term debt  which is denominated in australian dollars and matures through fiscal  and the fair value of interest rate swaps  totaling million that is related to our us dollar denominated long term debt and matures through fiscal on the date we enter into a derivative contract  we designate the derivative as a hedge of the identified exposure 
we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as the risk management objective and strategy for entering into various hedge transactions 
we identify in this documentation the asset  liability  firm commitment  or forecasted transaction that has been designated as a hedged item and indicate how the hedging instrument is expected to hedge the risks related to the hedged item 
we formally measure effectiveness of our hedging relationships both at the hedge inception and on an ongoing basis in accordance with our risk management policy 
we will discontinue hedge accounting prospectively if we determine that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of a hedged item  when the derivative expires or is sold  terminated or exercised  
table of contents if it becomes probable that the forecasted transaction being hedged by the derivative will not occur  because a hedged firm commitment no longer meets the definition of a firm commitment  or if we determine that designation of the derivative as a hedge instrument is no longer appropriate 
during the fiscal year ended october   we reclassified into earnings a net loss of million resulting from the expiration  sale  termination or exercise of derivative contracts 
additionally  we recognized a loss of million during the fiscal year ended october  for changes in the value of derivatives that were marked to fair value 
we enter into forward exchange and other derivative contracts with major banks and are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by these banks 
we anticipate  however  that these banks will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under the contracts 
accordingly  we do not obtain collateral or other security to support the contracts 
translation of results of international subsidiaries as discussed above  we are exposed to financial statement gains and losses as a result of translating the operating results and financial position of our international subsidiaries 
we translate the local currency statements of income of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars using the average exchange rate during the reporting period 
changes in foreign exchange rates affect our reported profits and distort comparisons from year to year 
we use various foreign currency exchange contracts and intercompany loans to hedge the profit and loss effects of such exposure  but accounting rules do not allow us to hedge the actual translation of sales and expenses 
by way of example  when the us dollar strengthens compared to the euro  there is a negative effect on our reported results for europe 
it takes more profits in euros to generate the same amount of profits in stronger us dollars 
the opposite is also true 
that is  when the us dollar weakens there is a positive effect 
in fiscal  the us dollar weakened compared to the euro 
as a result  our european sales increased in euros compared to the year before  but increased in us dollars 
the euro the primary countries where our european subsidiary operates  with the exception of the united kingdom  adopted the euro as legal currency effective january  at that time  exchange rates between the french franc and certain other european currencies were fixed versus the euro 
euro denominated currency began circulating as of january  our european subsidiary began processing transactions in euros as of november  interest rates most of our lines of credit and long term debt bear interest based on libor 
interest rates  therefore  can move up or down depending on market conditions 
as discussed above  we have entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure to such fluctuations 
the approximate amount of our remaining variable rate debt was million at october   and the average interest rate at that time was 
if interest rates were to increase by  our net income would be reduced by approximately  based on these fiscal levels
