business segments and product lines we are organized in three divisions  which allows us to focus more effectively on individual product lines  category management initiatives and certain specialty classes of trade 
our two largest divisions  the personal products division and the consumer products division  constituted approximately of our consolidated net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal personal products division the personal products division accounted for approximately of our consolidated net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal this division includes infant care and feminine care products sold in the united states primarily to mass merchandisers  grocery and drug classes of trade 
the infant care product category includes infant feeding products other infant care products playtex disposable nurser systems  diaper genie diaper disposal system  playtex cups and mealtime products  wet ones pre moistened towelettes  playtex reusable hard bottles  baby magic baby toiletries  playtex pacifiers  baby magic baby wipes  and mr 
bubble children s bubble bath 
the feminine care product category includes a wide range of plastic and cardboard applicator tampons  as well as complementary products  marketed under such brand names as tampons complementary products playtex gentle glide  playtex personal cleansing cloths playtex portables  for use in feminine hygiene  and playtex slimfits  playtex heat therapy patch to playtex silk glide  alleviate discomfort associated with menstrual pain 
infant care infant care accounted for approximately of personal products net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal our largest infant care business is infant feeding products  in which we held a market leading dollar market share in we are particularly strong in both the disposable feeding and the infant cup categories with dollar market shares of and  respectively 
we are also strong in the diaper pail category with our dollar market share leading diaper genie brand 
in pre moistened towelettes  our wet ones brand held a dollar market share of the hand and face segment 
our mr 
bubble brand held a dollar market share of the bath additives category and became the market share leader in this category during fiscal baby magic held a dollar market share of the infant toiletries category and is strong in the lotions and bath segments with and dollar market shares of those segments 
our strategy for maintaining market leadership positions is centered on continually offering new infant care solutions as well as improving existing products and expanding the size of the category  marketing directly to expectant mothers through specialized channels such as industry publications and pediatricians  and cross selling opportunities across all product lines 
disposable feeding reusable bottles we offer both disposable feeding systems and reusable bottles in addition to nipples and other complementary products marketed under the playtex brand 
historically  we have focused on the disposable segment  as we believe that disposable bottle liners are healthier and more convenient than traditional reusable bottles 
the disposable collapsible liner placed inside the holder limits the amount of air in take by the baby and reduces painful spit ups and burping 
in  we launched drop ins  a significant enhancement to the disposable product line 
drop ins  patented  ready formed disposable liners  made disposable liners much easier for parents to use and since its introduction has been the driving force behind our market share gains 
our disposable feeding systems currently account for of the product category 
in an effort to broaden our product offerings in the reusable bottle segment  we developed ventaire in the ventaire bottle  has a patented air venting system that allows air to escape as the baby sucks on the nipple  much like the benefits of a disposable bottle 
cups in  we introduced the spill proof cup  an innovation that changed the infant cup category 
prior to this introduction  there was no real distinct market segment for children s cups 
with the launch of the spill proof line  the category has expanded from million of retail sales to more than million in over the past few years  we have introduced new products to expand our offerings in the cups segment  including the quickstraw cup  the coolstraw cup  the big sipster  a cup targeted at older children  and the gripster  made to fit small hands 
in  we introduced the insulator cup line  representing the next generation in cup technology 
the insulator cup is designed to maintain the temperature and freshness of liquids for a longer period of time 
we held a market leading dollar market share in in  we will introduce the insulator sport  a new insulated leak proof cup with a flip top straw lid for growing kids and a new trainer cup for toddlers  the first sipster 
diaper disposal systems diaper genie  which we acquired in  leads the diaper disposal market with a dollar market share in the diaper genie business is comprised of two segments diaper genie diaper pail unit  and diaper genie liner refills  the largest component of the business 
the diaper pail unit individually seals diapers in an odor proof  germ proof chain 
the unit uses our proprietary refill liners  which typically lasts approximately one month 
in  we improved the diaper pail unit and introduced a new liner 
we improved the cutter cap system  which makes the unit easier to use and we introduced a toddler film refill to the market for older age children  targeted to extend the usage period 
a large percentage of the diaper pail units are given to expectant mothers as gifts 
this provides a unique opportunity to begin cross marketing our entire line of infant care products before the baby arrives 
baby toiletries baby magic  which we acquired in  occupies the number two position among the branded products in the us baby toiletries category defined as lotions  shampoos  powders  bath products  oils and gift packs  with a dollar market share in baby magic is strongest in the lotions and bath segments with and dollar market shares  respectively 
the us baby toiletries category has been extremely competitive since our acquisition of the baby magic brand in in the second quarter of  we introduced a new line of baby magic calming milk products including a foaming bath  bath lotion and massage lotion 
our dollar market share in the lotions and bath segments has increased since our launch of these products 
our market share results  in the fourth quarter of  were our best since the second quarter of our retail consumption increased in the fourth quarter of  while the category decreased compared to the fourth quarter of our full year dollar market share is down slightly compared to pre moistened towelettes early in we acquired wet ones  the market share leader in the hands and face segment of the market with a dollar market share in wet ones are used by parents and others in applications other than diaper changing  such as cleaning up after meals or traveling away from home 
the pre moistened towelette category experienced rapid growth over the last few years as competitors entered the category and invested heavily in advertising and promotion to generate trial of their product 
after two years of significant category growth  retail consumption in the category slowed in  increasing compared to our retail consumption increased and our dollar market share increased percentage points compared to other infant care brands we also entered the children s bubble bath and baby wipe categories in early with the acquisition of the mr 
bubble  chubs and diaparene brands 
our mr 
bubble children s bubble bath brand is a widely recognized brand name among consumers and became the market share leader in the bath additives category  in  with a dollar market share 
in fiscal  we decided to market our domestic baby wipes under the baby magic name and we continue to market chubs internationally 
our infant care marketing is focused on a specific group of people new and expectant mothers 
these consumers undertake an immense amount of research and education  both before the child is born and after  to enhance their ability to make informed decisions concerning the health and welfare of their new infants 
as such  we utilize techniques to communicate with parents in addition to traditional media advertising 
programs directed at new mothers include the distribution of millions of samples and coupons prenatally via childbirth instructors and postnatally in hospitals 
the company also provides educational materials to pediatricians  lactation consultants and hospitals such that new parents receive professional recommendations to use our infant care products 
in addition  we have developed the website www 
playtexbaby 
com to provide information to new and expectant mothers as well as to introduce and market our entire line of infant care products 
across our entire infant care products  we communicate an image of quality  health  innovation and convenience to attract and retain users 
feminine care playtex feminine care accounted for approximately of personal products net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal and in fiscal in the tampon category  consumer purchases are driven primarily by comfort  quality  protection and value  leading to intensely strong brand loyalties 
for over years  playtex has been the second largest selling tampon brand overall in the us and currently holds the largest position in the higher growth plastic applicator and deodorant segments 
we have been able to consistently grow our share of the tampon category through a strategy of offering a diversified product line providing choice for consumers  continuing new product development and product improvements  leveraging the playtex brand  strategically targeting new users young  first time feminine product users conversion of pad users to tampons  and category expansion through introducing complementary products 
for fiscal  we had a share of the tampon category 
since  we have grown our overall share of the tampon category by more than points and the share differential between playtex and the category share leader has narrowed from approximately points in to less than points in late in the third quarter of  the market share leader in the tampon category introduced a new plastic tampon product supported with extensive advertising and promotional spending 
our dollar market share in the tampon category decreased percentage points in the fourth quarter of due  in part  to the heavily promoted new competitive product 
for the first two months of  the market share trend is stable with that of the fourth quarter of  however it continues to lag behind similar year ago periods 
we intend to aggressively defend our market share in the tampon category with advertising support and the introduction of two product improvements including an improved soft pearlized plastic applicator and an improved deodorant fragrance  each of which is intended to enhance consumer benefits 
the improved product will be introduced by the first quarter of and should broadly reach retail shelves in the second quarter 
plastic applicator tampons historically  our core strength has resided in plastic applicator tampons where playtex is the clear leader with a dollar market share of the plastic applicator segment 
plastic applicator tampons represent approximately of our feminine care business 
we believe the plastic applicator segment enjoys superior growth dynamics as these products offer greater comfort and ease of insertion removal to the user  are popular among younger demographics and are premium priced relative to cardboard and digital applicator products 
gentle glide is our most significant plastic applicator tampon 
these soft plastic applicator tampons were designed with a smooth rounded tip and a unique double layer construction  allowing for ease of insertion and comfortable fit as well as reliable leakage protection 
our gentle glide line has provided a platform to launch new product enhancements 
for example  in  we introduced the odor absorbing product line that was the first to contain all natural material that absorbs odors without the use of a fragrance or deodorant 
this line was developed to appeal to the large group of women who are concerned with odor protection  yet reluctant to use a fragranced tampon 
portables were developed to provide maximum convenience and portability 
to meet consumer demand for smaller products  portables have a compact construction with a two piece applicator that allows the user to discreetly transport and easily assemble the product to a full sized applicator 
additionally  portables are associated with the same level of quality and protection as gentle glide products 
slimfits  introduced in  are designed to appeal to a key niche segment of the tampon category young teenagers 
the introduction of slimfits was a direct result of our strategy to focus on first time  feminine care product users 
to promote slimfits  we utilized focused teen awareness campaigns and targeted product sampling 
slimfits have a narrower applicator and pledget providing for greater comfort and ease of insertion 
we believe slimfits will continue to build our business over the long term by encouraging young women to use tampons rather than pads at an earlier age and by developing brand loyalty for our tampons at a time when lifelong preferences are forming 
we believe these teenagers will develop a loyalty to the playtex brand and they will naturally transition to the gentle glide line 
cardboard applicator tampons cardboard applicator tampons represented approximately of personal products feminine care business net sales in fiscal we have a full line of cardboard applicator tampons to provide a complete portfolio of product offerings to consumers and to best match a broader array of consumer preferences 
users tend to be loyal to one form of applicator over another  thus  the introduction of a cardboard applicator to the tampon product portfolio has allowed us to leverage the playtex brand name to capture a share of the cardboard applicator segment 
silk glide is our line of cardboard applicator tampons 
this line features a rounded tip cardboard applicator and a unique surface coating which aims to provide the user with a high quality product in the cardboard applicator segment of the tampon category 
this product is designed to provide similar comfort and ease of insertion found in plastic applicator tampons 
moreover  the silk glide line also serves as a platform to launch product extensions such as our silk glide odor absorbing tampons  the only product of its type in the cardboard segment 
complementary feminine care products we recently introduced two new complementary feminine care products leveraging the consumer trust and strong brand awareness of our tampon franchise 
we have been successful in working with retailers to merchandise these products in the feminine care aisle alongside our tampons to best leverage the playtex brand name 
these products demonstrate our ability to expand the category beyond tampons and should provide incremental sales growth going forward 
in  we introduced personal cleansing cloths  pre moistened towelettes for feminine hygiene 
it has become the brand in this small but growing niche category 
our personal cleansing cloths are formulated with vitamin e and aloe and offer antibacterial efficacy 
we introduced the playtex heat therapy patch in july we believe there is potential for this product based upon research results and positive retailer feedback 
designed to be discrete and alleviate the discomfort associated with menstrual cramps for up to hours  the playtex patch is differentiated from other heat patches marketed to alleviate other types of discomfort 
consistent with our overall marketing strategy  our marketing efforts in feminine care have leveraged the strength of the playtex brand that caters to the active  young female 
employing a pull strategy  we focus on advertising and selective consumer promotional activity to build our brand equity 
our feminine care marketing strategy centers on attracting first time users and converting feminine protection pad users to tampon users by communicating the advantages of tampon usage 
to that end  several recent advertising campaigns have highlighted the diaper like  bulky nature of the feminine protection pad while promoting the comfort and convenience of tampons 
given our singular focus on tampons  we believe that we are well positioned among our competitors to endorse tampons over pads and we hope to capture a disproportionately high number of new users 
consumer products division the consumer products division accounted for approximately of our consolidated net sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal and this division includes sun care  household products  and personal grooming products sold in the united states  primarily to mass merchandisers  grocery and drug classes of trade 
sun care our sun care business consists of an extensive line of sun care products marketed under the banana boat trade name and accounted for approximately of consumer products net sales in fiscal  in fiscal  and in fiscal our offerings consist of an extensive line of sun care products designed for specific uses  such as sun protection with sun protection factors spfs from to  waterproof and sweat proof formulas and infant and children s products 
in  we extended our banana boat franchise into the indoor tanning market 
we also sell a variety of banana boat skin care products  including sunless tanning lotion and after sun moisturizers containing additional ingredients such as vitamin e and aloe vera 
our sun care products are a strong number two in the us sun care category with a dollar market share in retail consumption of our sun care products grew in compared to for the sun care category 
our results  at retail  benefited from two new products for the sun care season vitaskin and indoor tanning 
vitaskin combines the benefits of sun protection with a quality skin care product designed for everyday use and our indoor tanning product is our first product offering in the indoor tanning segment 
since  banana boat has been able to consistently grow its share of the sun care category through a strategy of providing new and differentiated products  communicating banana boat s family oriented image  thus targeting the most attractive user groups  and working with our customers to best maximize sales and profitability through active category management 
for the sun care season  we continue to bring new products to the market  including two new product lines banana boat suntanicals and banana boat baby magic 
new suntanicals lotions are enriched with lavender and chamomile botanicals to indulge the skin and senses for a healthy looking tan 
combining the heritage of two leading brands  banana boat baby magic sunblocks are clinically proven mild and offer a patented instant protection formula in the lotion that is superior to other baby sunblocks 
new in indoor tanning is a skin cooling tan booster that provides a skin cooling sensation while tanning 
a new extension to the vitaskin advanced sun protection line is a two step system that combines an exfoliating scrub with an instant sunless tanner to guarantee a more even  natural looking tan 
in addition  we are introducing a new tanning oil spray with carrot extract 
we have also upsized our general protection spf and sport spf to ounces to provide more value to the consumer 
lastly  we have created more contemporary packaging graphics across the portfolio to simplify the consumer s shopping experience 
our sun care marketing strategies are directed at the family demographic  where banana boat communicates a fun in the sun for the active wholesome family image 
in addition  the marketing and sales plan for banana boat utilizes specialized programs including sweepstakes  sampling at outdoor events  radio tie ins and new store openings to provide additional visibility for the brand 
our interactive website  www 
bananaboat 
com  conveys educational information in a fun  casual manner 
to supplement our distribution network  we have a direct store delivery dsd distribution team focused in high consumption areas of the us east and west coast 
with a fleet of more than thirty vans and operators with an in depth knowledge of our sun care products  the dsd network allows us to build strong retailer relationships  gather marketing intelligence and ensure that our products are properly stocked on retailer shelves 
industry convention and the seasonal nature of the sun care business require that manufacturers of sun care products provide retailers with the opportunity to return unsold products at the end of the sun care season 
to better reflect the impact of potential returns  we provide for estimated returns in our reported operating results as sales are made throughout the year 
the level of returns may fluctuate from our estimates due to several factors including weather conditions  customer inventory levels  and competitive conditions see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies of this annual report on form k 
in  we initiated a more proactive approach to managing late season shipments to retailers  which negatively impacted our comparable net sales results 
the initiative is to better align our shipment patterns to retail consumption patterns during the sun care season 
as such  we shipped less product during the second half of than in prior years 
we expect to ship more product in the first half of as a result of the initial implementation of this initiative 
we experienced higher than expected sun care product returns  in  from the sun care season  which necessitated a change in estimate of our sales return reserve 
this adjustment resulted from a few key accounts that unexpectedly returned excess product 
we believe our initiatives to reduce sun care product returns will result in reducing the overall costs associated with our sun care business  as we better align our shipment patterns with consumption patterns for the sun care season 
household products personal grooming our household products personal grooming business consists of a number of leading and well recognized brands including our woolite rug and upholstery cleaning products  playtex household gloves  ogilvie at home permanents and binaca breath spray and drops 
we also compete in the value priced end of the toothbrush business with our tek and dentax brands of toothbrushes  and in deodorants with our tussy brand 
these products accounted for approximately of our consumer products net sales in fiscal  compared to in fiscal and in fiscal woolite holds the position in the us rug and upholstery cleaning products category with a dollar market share in driving net sales and market share growth in were two new products woolite instant power shot non foaming aerosol cleaner designed for quick removal of stains  introduced late in and woolite oxy deep oxygen based carpet cleaner designed to remove tough set in stains introduced in the third quarter of these two products accounted for dollar market share points in the fourth quarter of and significantly contributed to our full year market share and retail consumption gains in with a long standing reputation for superior quality  durability and value  playtex gloves have enjoyed market share leadership since we introduced reusable household latex gloves in the us in the playtex brand name is virtually the only well known name in the segment and our living and handsaver brands are recognized as the highest quality reusable household gloves in the industry 
playtex is the only major household glove manufacturer with production in the us as demand for disposable household gloves grew  we introduced a line of disposable gloves to leverage the playtex brand in this category 
we offer a complete line of gloves to retailers and have expanded our shelf presence in recent years 
in  we lost dollar market share points due to competitive activities and an increase in private label  which is not unusual during tough economic times 
our ogilvie brand is the market leader of the at home permanents and straighteners category  with a dollar market share in retail consumption of at home permanent products has been declining due to the tendency of consumers to get their hair permed in professional beauty salons 
our strategy is to grow our market leadership position by repositioning the brand to younger consumers and  as category leader  to positively impact the growth of the category as a whole 
since our acquisition of the ogilvie brand we have successfully launched ogilvie straightener  which removes the curl from permed hair  controls the curl from naturally curly hair  and delivers smooth texture to hair 
this product is targeted to younger consumers 
our binaca brand of breath fresheners is also a well known brand 
it is the leader in the spray drops segment of the breath fresheners market with a dollar market share in our research indicates that binaca has the highest brand awareness among breath freshener users

f 
competition the markets for our products are highly competitive and they are characterized by the frequent introduction of new products  often accompanied by major advertising and promotional programs 
we compete primarily on the basis of product quality  product differentiation and brand name recognition supported by advertising and promotional programs 
our competitors consist of a large number of domestic and foreign companies  many of which have significantly greater financial resources and less debt than we do 
we believe that the market for consumer packaged goods is very competitive and may intensify further in the future 
competitive pressures on our products may result from new competitors  higher spending for advertising and promotion  and new product initiatives by competitors  continued activity in the private label sector 
our infant care  feminine care and gloves businesses are particularly competitive 
cups have been challenged by competitors offering less expensive products and new competitors entered the disposable feeding  baby toiletries and pre moistened towelettes categories in recent years 
in  the market share leader in the tampon category introduced a new plastic tampon product supported with extensive advertising and promotions  and our gloves business has weakened due to competitive activities and an increase in private label  which is not unusual during tough economic times

the playtex and living trademarks in the united states and canada are owned by playtex marketing 
playtex marketing is responsible for protecting  exercising quality control over and enforcing the trademarks 
along with apparel  we have a license from playtex marketing for the use of such trademarks in the united states and canada on a perpetual  royalty free basis 
apparel s license is for apparel and apparel related products  and our license is for all other products 
in all other countries  apparel retains title to the playtex and living trademarks 
we have a perpetual  royalty free license to use such trademarks for all products other than apparel products in all other countries 
we also own a royalty free license in perpetuity to use the woolite trademark for rug and upholstery cleaning products in the united states and canada 
we also own various patents related to certain products and their method of manufacture  including patents for cardboard and plastic applicators for tampons  special over wrap for tampons  baby bottles and nipples  disposable liners and plastic holders for the nurser systems  children s drinking cups  pacifiers  sunscreen formulation  carpet cleaning compositions  various containers for liquid and moist wipes products  including special containers for children s bubble bath 
the patents expire at varying times  ranging from to we also have pending patent applications for various products and methods of manufacture relating to our tampons  infant feeding and sun care businesses 
while we consider our patents to be important to our business  we believe that the success of our products is more dependent upon the quality of these products and the effectiveness of our marketing programs 
no single patent is material to our business 
k 
raw materials and suppliers the principal raw materials used in the manufacture of our products are synthetic fibers  resin based plastics and other chemicals and certain natural materials  all of which are normally readily available 
while all raw materials are purchased from outside sources  we are not dependent upon a single supplier in any of our operations for any material essential to our business or not otherwise commercially available to us 
we have been able to obtain an adequate supply of raw materials  and no shortage of any materials is currently anticipated 
l 
customers and backlog no single customer or affiliated group of customers  except walmart  accounted for over of our net sales in fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal our next three largest customers represented in total approximately of our total consolidated net sales in each of our last three fiscal years see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with industry practice  we grant credit to our customers at the time of purchase 
in addition  we may grant extended payment terms to new customers and for the initial sales of introductory products and product line extensions 
we also may grant extended terms on our sun care products due to industry convention and the seasonal nature of this business 
our practice is not to accept returned goods unless authorized by management of the sales organization 
returns result primarily from damage and shipping discrepancies 
exceptions to this policy include our sun care seasonal returns 
we allow customers to return sun care products that have not been sold by the end of the sun care season  which is normal practice in the sun care industry 
customers are required to pay for the sun care product purchased during the season under the required terms 
in instances where extended terms are granted on initial sun care orders  the terms require a substantial payment be made in the june time frame 
we generally receive returns of our sun care products from september through march following the summer sun care season 
in  we initiated a more proactive approach to reduce the expense associated with sun care product returns 
the initiative is to better align our shipment patterns to retail consumption patterns during the sun care season 
in addition  we are requesting that retailers return unsold sun care product prior to the start of the next sun care season 
as such  we believe most of our season sun care product returns were processed in fiscal we reduce our sun care sales and increase accrued liabilities for estimated returns  at the same time  based on management s estimates of these returns as a percent of sun care products sold 
refunds made to our customers for returned sun care products subsequently reduce accrued liabilities see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies of this annual report on form k for a more complete discussion on our policies regarding sun care product returns 
because of the short period between order and shipment dates generally less than one month for most of our orders  the dollar amount of current backlog is not considered to be a reliable indication of future sales volume 
m 
employees and labor relations our worldwide workforce consisted of approximately  employees as of december   of whom approximately were located outside the united states  primarily in canada 
we believe that our labor relations are satisfactory and no material labor cost increases are anticipated in the near future 
of the united states facilities  only the operation at watervliet  new york had union representation at december  during  we initiated a process to close our watervliet  new york facility see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we expect this process to be completed prior to the expiration  on june   of the current collective bargaining agreement 
n 
environmental we believe that we are in substantial compliance with federal  state and local provisions enacted or adopted regulating the discharge of materials hazardous to the environment 
there are no significant environmental expenditures anticipated for the current year

risk factors our business is subject to certain risks  and we want you to review these risks while you are evaluating our business and our historical results 
please keep in mind  that any of the following risks discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report could materially and adversely affect us  our operating results  our financial condition and our projections and beliefs as to our future performance 
as such  our results could differ materially from those projected in our forward looking statements 
in addition  the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts and timing of revenue and expenses  the reported amounts and classification of assets and liabilities  and the disclosure of contingent liabilities 
actual results may vary from our estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical results  assumptions that we make as well as assumptions by third parties 
the level of reserves for sun care product returns  bad debts and advertising and promotional costs are three areas of which you should be aware 
as part of our customary review and reconciliation process  we periodically record adjustments to our accounting estimates 
during the second quarter ended june   we recorded additional expenses of million to cover higher than expected sun care returns from the sun care season 
also  we reduced our reserves for certain advertising and sales promotion programs conducted prior to by million based on the actual costs of these programs versus our original estimates 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies of this annual report on form k 
we may not enter into a transaction associated with our decision to evaluate strategic alternatives 
on november   we announced our intention to undertake a process to evaluate strategic alternatives for maximizing shareholder value 
the strategic alternatives to be considered include  but are not limited to  business combinations with one or more parties to form a larger personal care and household products company  selling the entire company  divesting one or more lines of business  and acquiring strategic lines of business 
there is no assurance this process will result in a transaction 
we have substantial debt  which has risks and restrictions 
our indebtedness at december  consists of million in fixed rate debt and million of variable rate debt 
we intend to fund our operations  capital expenditures  debt service requirements and repay additional portions of debt principal through cash flow generated from operations  including proceeds from the sale of an undivided fractional interest in our accounts receivables through the receivables facility see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k  and borrowings under the revolving credit facility through fiscal however  we do not expect to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make the and scheduled principal payments on the term c loan  which collectively total million 
in addition  we do not expect to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make the million scheduled principal payment on the senior subordinated notes due june  accordingly  we will have to refinance our obligations  sell assets or raise equity capital to repay the principal amounts of these obligations 
historically  we have been successful in generating operating cash flows and in obtaining the required refinancing to meet all of our obligations 
however  we cannot guarantee that our operating results will continue to be sufficient or that future borrowing facilities will be available for the payment or refinancing of our debt on economically attractive terms 
our level of debt could have adverse consequences to us  including  but not limited to our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate purposes or other purposes may be impaired 
a significant portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our debt  which reduces the funds available to our operations 
a portion of our debt  million at december  is at variable rates of interest  which may result in higher interest expense in the event of increases in interest rates 
our indebtedness also contains certain financial and restrictive covenants see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources of this annual report on form k 
our failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default  which  if not rectified  may materially and adversely affect our operating results and our financial condition 
we may incur goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges 
acquisitions recorded as purchases for accounting purposes have resulted  and in the future may result  in the recognition of significant amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets 
at december   we had million of goodwill and million of other intangible assets consisting primarily of trademarks  patents and other intellectual property 
we review these intangible assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
effective december   the beginning of our fiscal year  we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which changed our accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
we tested our goodwill  under the methodologies as outlined in sfas no 
 for impairment as of december  and march  and determined that none of our goodwill was impaired 
we also tested each of our trademarks for impairment by comparing the fair value of each trademark to its carrying value as of december  and march  based on these impairment tests  we recorded a charge  reported as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principles  of million million or per diluted share  net of tax benefits in the first quarter of see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
this charge was to reduce the trademark carrying value of certain non core brands  primarily chubs and diaparene  to their estimated fair value 
we are required to test our goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate a likelihood of impairment 
changes in the fair value of our businesses caused by various factors  some of which may be out of our control  may cause us to take additional impairment charges in the future 
we face significant competition from other consumer products companies 
the markets for our products are highly competitive and are characterized by the frequent introduction of new products  often accompanied by major advertising and promotional programs 
we believe that the market for consumer packaged goods will continue to be highly competitive and that the level of competition may intensify in the future 
our competitors consist of a large number of domestic and foreign companies  a number of which have significantly greater financial resources than we do and are not as highly leveraged as we are 
if we are unable to continue to introduce new and innovative products that are attractive to consumers  or are unable to allocate sufficient resources to effectively market and advertise our products so that they achieve widespread market acceptance  we may not be able to compete effectively and our operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected 
our infant care  feminine care and gloves businesses are particularly competitive 
cups have been challenged by competitors offering less expensive products and new competitors entered the disposable feeding  baby toiletries and pre moistened towelettes categories in recent years 
in  the market share leader in the tampon category introduced a new plastic tampon product supported with extensive advertising and promotions and our gloves business has weakened due to competitive activities and an increase in private label 
in each case  we are aggressively defending our market share positions  but many of our competitors have greater financial resources than we do 
we rely on a few large customers for a significant portion of our sales 
a few of our customers are material to our business and operations 
in fiscal  walmart our largest customer  represented approximately of our consolidated net sales 
aggregate consolidated net sales to our next three largest customers represented approximately of our total consolidated net sales in fiscal the loss of sales to a large customer could materially and adversely affect us  our operating results  our financial condition and our projections and beliefs as to our future performance 
we may be adversely affected by the trend towards retail trade consolidation 
with the growing trend towards retail trade consolidation  we are increasingly dependent upon key retailers whose bargaining strength is growing 
we may be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retail trade customers  such as inventory destocking  limitations on access to shelf space and other conditions 
sales of some of our products may suffer because of unfavorable weather conditions 
our businesses  especially sun care  may be negatively impacted by unfavorable weather conditions 
in accordance with industry practice  we allow customers to return unsold sun care products at the end of the summer and these product returns may be higher in years when the weather is poor 
this could adversely affect our business and operating results 
in addition  consumption of our feminine care and wet ones products may be affected by unfavorable weather  although to a lesser extent than the sun care business  due primarily to reduced levels of outdoor activities 
our acquisition strategy is subject to risks and may not be successful 
we consider the acquisition of other companies engaged in the manufacture and sale of consumer products 
at any given time  we may be in various stages of looking at these opportunities 
acquisitions are subject to the negotiation of definitive agreements and to other matters typical in acquisition transactions 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify desirable acquisition candidates or will be successful in entering into definitive agreements relating to them 
even if definitive agreements are entered into  we cannot assure you that any future acquisition will be completed or that anticipated benefits of the acquisition will be realized 
the process of integrating acquired operations into our operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties  may absorb significant management attention and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations 
future acquisitions by us could result in the incurrence of additional debt and contingent liabilities  which may have a negative effect on our operating results

since these studies  numerous claims have been filed against all tampon manufacturers  a small percentage of which have been litigated to conclusion 
the number of tss claims relating to our tampons has declined substantially over the years 
during the mid s  there were approximately pending claims at any one time relating to our tampons 
as of the end of february  there were approximately pending claims 
additional claims  however  may be asserted in the future 
for tss claims filed from october  until november   we are self insured and bear the costs of defending those claims  including settlements and trials 
effective december   we obtained insurance coverage with certain limits in excess of the self insured retention of million per occurrence million in total  for claims occurring on or after december  the incidence rate of menstrually associated tss has declined significantly over the years 
the number of confirmed menstrually related tss cases peaked in at  with deaths 
at that time  the united states center for disease control found that of women who developed the condition had been using a new brand of tampons 
that brand of product was removed from the market and the food and drug administration proposed regulations  which required all tampon manufacturers to provide tss warnings on their labeling 
in  the incidence of menstrually related tss was reported to be  with deaths 
it has continued to fall since then 
compared with the menstrual tss cases in  there were only three confirmed cases in and six in we believe that there are no claims or litigation pending against us  including the tss cases  which  individually or in the aggregate  would have a material effect on us 
this assessment is based on our experience with tss cases  the federally mandated warnings about tss on and our evaluation of the pending claims  in our tampon packages  and the reported decline in the incidence development of case law upholding the adequacy of menstrually associated tss  tampon warnings that comply with federally mandated tss warnings 
we have joined a group of potentially responsible parties with respect to the kent county landfill site in houston  delaware  which has been designated a superfund site by the state of delaware

we will share equally with apparel all expenses and costs associated with our involvement with this site

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we periodically use financial instruments  such as derivatives  to manage the impact of interest rate changes on our variable rate debt and its effect on our earnings and cash flows 
our policies prohibit the use of derivative instruments for the sole purpose of trading for profit on price fluctuations or to enter into contracts  which intentionally increase our underlying interest rate exposure 
at december   our total indebtedness consisted of million in fixed rate debt and million in variable rate debt 
we currently are not a party to any financial instruments  such as derivatives  to manage the impact of interest rate changes on our variable rate debt 
based on our interest rate exposure at december   a increase in interest rates would result in an estimated million of additional interest expense on an annualized basis see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k
