except as otherwise noted  the discussion of financial results gives effect to the accounting adjustments described in recent event below 
recent event as a result of a review we initiated in december  we have restated our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended september  and and for the quarters ended december  through june  we have also adjusted the preliminary consolidated financial statement information for the quarter and fiscal year ended september  announced on october  and for the quarter ended december  announced on january   and any adjustments for those periods described herein are as compared to such preliminary consolidated financial statement information 
as discussed below  although adjustments vary significantly by period in some cases  the cumulative net effect of the adjustments for fiscal years through is to increase our accumulated deficit at 
table of contents september  by million to billion 
the following table provides additional information regarding these adjustments 
effects on net loss increase decrease in millions year ended september  nine months ended june  three months ended september  total for three years ended september  as restated as restated as restated expenses paid by significant stockholder and director stock options issued by acquired companies  net of goodwill amortization offset revenue adjustments other operating expense adjustments income tax adjustments total effect on net loss increase decrease represents the aggregate effect of restating our consolidated financial statements for the period from october  to june  and adjusting our preliminary consolidated financial information announced on october  for the quarter ended september  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the effect of these adjustments and note of notes to consolidated financial statements for adjustments to previously reported unaudited quarterly consolidated statements of operations data for the quarters ended december  through june  as a result of the restatements 
the following discussion addresses each of these items expenses paid by significant stockholder and director 
as previously announced  the review initially focused on a million payment in march from keith krach  our chairman and co founder to larry mueller  our president and chief operating officer at the time  and mr 
krach s payment of million for chartered air services provided to mr 
mueller over the period from september through july because no company funds were used in these transactions and there was no commitment to or from us  ariba originally viewed these payments as personal 
as previously announced  we have now concluded that  for accounting purposes  we should treat these transactions as if they were capital contributions from mr 
krach which were then expensed by ariba as compensation to mr 
mueller 
accordingly  our restated consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended september  and reflect non cash charges to operating expenses in connection with these transactions 
stock options issued by acquired companies 
as previously announced  we also reviewed our accounting for stock options issued by companies we acquired in fiscal year we determined that certain stock options granted by these acquired companies to a limited number of individuals shortly before those acquisitions should be accounted for as stock based compensation expense  rather than be included as part of the purchase price of these companies and amortized as goodwill 
as a result  our restated consolidated financial statements for fiscal years and and our consolidated financial statements for fiscal year reflect an increase in non cash stock based compensation expense and a reduction of goodwill amortization expense 
we also determined that the fair value of certain unvested stock options granted by one of these companies to several consultants was 
table of contents not included in the measurement of stock compensation expense as required by eitf no 
the cumulative effect of these adjustments is a non cash charge of million  consisting of increases to ariba s operating expenses for fiscal years and of million and million  respectively  and a non cash reduction of operating expenses of million for fiscal year 
we also reviewed our accounting policies and their application to various additional items and identified a number of transactions in which our accounting policies had not been consistently or appropriately applied 
we have included the adjustments described below for these items in our restated consolidated financial statements 
revenue adjustments 
we identified three license arrangements that we entered into with vendors during fiscal years and at or about the same time we incurred obligations to purchase goods or services from those vendors 
we have concluded that we should record expenditures associated with our obligations as reductions of license revenues received from the customer 
the effect of these adjustments  while not affecting cumulative net loss  is to decrease revenues by  million and  in fiscal years  and  respectively 
we also determined that the timing of revenue recognition for several license arrangements should be adjusted between periods  which adjustments result in the acceleration of revenue in certain cases and the deferral of revenue in others 
the net effect of these adjustments is to decrease revenues by  in fiscal year and to increase revenues by million and  in fiscal years and  respectively 
as a result of all of these revenue adjustments  our revenues decreased by million and million in fiscal years and  respectively  and increased by  in fiscal year other operating expense and income tax adjustments 
in addition  we identified several accrued expense items for which we concluded that the amount of the liability  the initial timing of recording the liability  or the timing of releasing the liability should be adjusted 
these items include accruals for payroll taxes  royalties payable  litigation  bonuses and benefits  and income taxes 
these accrued expense adjustments  together with expense reductions resulting from the revenue adjustments described above  caused operating expenses to decrease by million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year and caused the provision for income taxes to increase by million in fiscal year and decrease by million in fiscal year these adjustments include a subsequent event related to a tax claim resolved in fiscal year that reduces expenses in fiscal year and increases expenses in the quarter ended december  by million compared to previously announced preliminary results for those periods 
none of the adjustments described in this recent event has any impact on our cash balances for any period 
however  our consolidated statements of cash flows have been restated to reflect the reclassification of amounts received in connection with business partner warrants from operating activities to financing activities 
the effect of these adjustments is to increase net cash used in operating activities by million and million for fiscal years and  respectively  and to increase net cash provided by financing activities by million and million for fiscal years and  respectively

we were incorporated in delaware in september and from that date through march were in the development stage  conducting research and developing our initial products 
in march  we began selling our products and related services and currently market them in north america  latin america  europe  asia and australia primarily through our direct sales force and through indirect sales channels 
we have incurred significant losses since inception 
as of september   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately billion  including cumulative charges for the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets totaling billion  impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets totaling billion  amortization of stock based compensation totaling million  and business partner warrant expense totaling million  of which million has been reclassified as a reduction of revenues due to our adoption of eitf no 
our operating expenses include amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets that we recorded in fiscal year in connection with our acquisitions of tradingdynamics  tradex and suppliermarket and an intellectual property agreement with a third party 
during the year ended september   we also had a charge related to the purchase of in process research and development related to these acquisitions 
during the year ended september   we recorded a billion impairment charge relating to goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in the tradex acquisition as a result of an impairment assessment of goodwill and identifiable assets recorded in connection with our various acquisitions 
as of september   we had unamortized goodwill and other intangible assets of approximately million  which were being amortized on a straight line basis over their total expected useful lives ranging from two years to three years 
as a result of our adoption of sfas no 
on october   we ceased amortization of the remaining goodwill that had a net book value of approximately million 
other identifiable intangible assets with a net book value of approximately million at october  will continue to be amortized over their remaining useful lives  substantially all of which will expire in the quarter ending march  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more detailed information 
our operating expenses also include non cash charges for business partner warrants 
these expenses relate to warrants that have been earned by our business partners pursuant to alliance agreements entered into during fiscal during fiscal year  we determined that the carrying value of the intangible asset received in exchange for one such business partner warrant was impaired and recorded a million impairment charge to business partner warrant expense to write off the remaining net book value of this asset 
during fiscal  we recorded a charge of million representing the uncollected receivable and related settlement costs related to this intangible asset as a business partner warrant expense 
fully vested warrants issued in connection with 
table of contents business partner agreements were recorded as intangible assets based on their estimated fair value and were amortized over the life of the agreement 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more detailed information 
in connection with certain stock options granted to our employees  stock options issued pursuant to the tradingdynamics and suppliermarket acquisitions and restricted common stock issued to certain senior executives  officers and employees  we have recorded deferred stock based compensation totaling approximately million from inception through september  after giving effect to the restatement of our consolidated financial statements 
of this amount  million related to the issuance of stock options prior to our initial public offering in june and million and million related to the acquisitions of tradingdynamics and suppliermarket  respectively  each  consummated in fiscal deferred stock based compensation is included as a component of stockholders equity and is being amortized by charges to operations over the vesting period of the options and restricted stock 
during the year ended september   we recorded million of related stock based compensation amortization expense 
as of september   we have approximately million of deferred stock based compensation remaining to be amortized 
the amortization of the remaining deferred stock based compensation is expected to result in additional charges to operations through fiscal year the amortization of stock based compensation is presented as a separate component of operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more detailed information 
we had full time employees as of september   representing a reduction from september  during fiscal year  we initiated a restructuring program to align our expense and revenue levels and to better position us for growth and profitability 
in addition  we implemented a further reduction of our worldwide workforce during the quarter ended december  and recorded an additional restructuring charge in the quarter ended june  related to our abandonment of certain operating leases as part of our program to restructure our operations and related facilities 
our recent restructurings have placed significant demands on our management and operational resources 
to position our company for future growth  we must continue to invest in and implement scalable operational systems  procedures and controls 
we must also be able to recruit and retain qualified employees and expect any future expansion to continue to challenge our ability to hire  train  manage and retain our employees 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more detailed information 
the market for our solutions is intensely competitive  evolving and subject to rapid technological change 
the intensity of competition has increased and is expected to further increase in the future 
this increased competition has resulted in price pressure and could result in reduced gross margins and loss of market share  either one of which could seriously harm our business 
competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and services offered 
we compete with several major client server enterprise software companies including sap  oracle and peoplesoft 
in the area of sourcing solutions specifically  we compete with services companies such as freemarkets  as well as other small software companies such as bemarkets  ebreviate  emptoris and frictionless commerce  among others 
in addition  because spend management is a relatively new software category  we expect additional competition from other established and emerging companies  if this market continues to develop and expand 
to maintain and grow our current revenue level  we must grow our customer base  develop our products and services  and adapt to current information technology purchasing patterns 
however  if we continue to sell an increasing percentage of our newer lower priced products  our average selling prices may decline 
we intend to continue to invest in sales  marketing  research and development and  to a lesser extent  support infrastructure 
we may also have significant expenses going forward related to the amortization of our other intangible assets 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as a result  we may incur substantial losses the future 
our limited operating history makes the prediction of future operating results very difficult 
we believe that period to period comparisons of operating results should not be relied upon as predictive of future performance 

table of contents our operating results are expected to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and are difficult or impossible to predict 
we believe that our success in fiscal year will depend particularly upon our ability to effectively market our enterprise spend management solutions and maintain tight control over expenses and cash 
we believe that key risks include our market execution in europe  the status of our relationship with softbank  the overall level of information technology spending and the potential adverse impact resulting from the restatement of our consolidated financial statements and related regulatory inquiries and legal proceedings 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties encountered by companies at an early stage of development  particularly given that we operate in new and rapidly evolving markets  have completed several acquisitions and face an uncertain economic environment 
we may not be successful in addressing such risks and difficulties 
please refer to the risk factors section for additional information 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
accounting policies  methods and estimates are an integral part of the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap and  in part  are based upon management s current judgments 
those judgments are normally based on knowledge and experience with regard to past and current events and assumptions about future events 
certain accounting policies  methods and estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ markedly from management s current judgments 
while there are a number of accounting policies  methods and estimates affecting our consolidated financial statements  areas that are particularly significant include revenue recognition policies  the assessment of recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets  restructuring liabilities related to abandoned operating leases and contingencies related to the collectibility of accounts receivable and pending litigation 
these critical accounting policies and estimates  their related disclosures and other accounting policies  methods and estimates have been reviewed by our senior management and audit committee 
these policies and our practices related to these policies are described below and in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenues are principally derived from licenses of our products  from maintenance and support contracts and from the delivery of implementation  consulting and training services 
our products are licensed under a perpetual license model or under a time based license model 
access to the ariba supplier network is available to ariba customers as part of their maintenance agreements for certain products 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended 
we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  we have no significant obligations with regard to implementation  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is probable 
we consider all arrangements with payment terms extending beyond one year to not be fixed and determinable  and revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer 
if  at the inception of the arrangement  collectibility is not considered probable  revenue is not recognized until the fee is collected 
sop  as amended  generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair values of the elements 
revenue recognized from multiple element arrangements is allocated to undelivered elements of the arrangement  such as maintenance and support services and professional services  based on the relative fair values of the elements specific to us 
our determination of the fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
we limit our assessment of vsoe for each element to either the price charged when the same element is sold separately or the price established by management  having the relevant authority to do so  for an element not yet sold separately 
if evidence of fair value of all undelivered elements exists but evidence does not exist for one or more delivered elements  then the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 

table of contents arrangements that include consulting services are evaluated to determine whether those services are essential to the functionality of other elements of the arrangement 
when services are not considered essential  the revenue allocable to the services is recognized separately from the software  provided that vsoe of fair value exists for the services 
if we provide consulting services that are considered essential to the functionality of the software products  both the software product revenue and service revenue are recognized using contract accounting in accordance with the provisions of sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
we frequently enter into contracts where we recognize only a portion of the total revenue under the contract in the quarter in which we enter into the contract 
for example  we may recognize revenue on a ratable basis over the life of the contract or enter into contracts where the recognition of revenue is conditioned upon delivery of future product or service elements 
the portion of revenues recognized on a deferred basis may vary significantly in any given quarter  and revenues in any given quarter are a function of both contracts signed in such quarter and contracts signed in prior quarters 
for example  the portion of revenues from contracts entered into in prior quarters generally declined in fiscal year and increased in fiscal year since then  the portion of revenues from contracts entered into in prior quarters has remained relatively stable and has represented at least a majority of the revenues recognized in each quarter 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for detailed discussion of our revenue recognition policies 
deferred revenue includes amounts received from customers for which revenue has not been recognized that generally results from deferred maintenance and support  consulting or training services not yet rendered and license revenue deferred until all requirements under sop are met 
deferred revenue is recognized as revenue upon delivery of our product  as services are rendered  or as other requirements requiring deferral under sop are satisfied 
accounts receivable include amounts due from customers for which revenue has been recognized 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount we estimate to be sufficient to provide for actual losses resulting from collecting less than full payment on our receivables 
a considerable amount of judgment is required when we assess the realizability of receivables  including assessing the probability of collection and the current credit worthiness of each customer 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  an additional provision for doubtful accounts might be required 
alternatively  if the financial condition of our customers were to improve such that their ability to make payments was no longer considered impaired  we would reduce related estimated reserves with a credit to the provision for doubtful accounts 
recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets management is required to regularly review all of its long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include  but are not limited to  significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and decreases in our market capitalization below net book value 
when management determines that an impairment review is necessary based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
significant judgment is required in the development of projected cash flows for these purposes including assumptions regarding the appropriate level of aggregation of cash flows  their term and discount rate as well as the underlying forecasts of expected future revenue and expense 
we have recorded significant impairment charges for goodwill and intangible assets in the past  and to the extent that events or circumstances cause our assumptions to change  additional charges may be required which could be material 

table of contents lease abandonment costs we initially recorded a significant restructuring charge in the third quarter of fiscal upon abandoning certain operating leases as part of our program to restructure our operations and related facilities and we recorded an additional charge in the third quarter of fiscal in the quarter ended june   we revised our estimates and expectations for our corporate headquarters and field offices disposition efforts as a result of changed estimates of sublease commencement dates and rental rate projections to reflect continued sharp declines in market conditions in the commercial real estate market in northern california 
lease abandonment costs for the abandoned facilities were estimated to include the impairment of leasehold improvements  remaining lease liabilities and brokerage fees offset by estimated sublease income 
estimates related to sublease costs and income are based on assumptions regarding the period required to locate and contract with suitable sub lessees and sublease rates which were achieved using market trend information analyses provided by a commercial real estate brokerage firm retained by us 
each reporting period we review these estimates  and to the extent that our assumptions change  the ultimate restructuring expenses for these abandoned facilities could vary significantly from current estimates 
for example  a change in assumed market lease rates of per square foot per month for the next years  with all other assumptions remaining the same  would change the estimated lease abandonment loss of our sunnyvale  california headquarters by approximately million 
legal contingencies we are subject to various claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business 
we have accrued for estimated losses in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for those matters where we believe that the likelihood that a loss has occurred is probable and the amount of loss is reasonably estimable 
although we currently believe that we have adequately accrued for estimable and probable losses regarding the outcome of outstanding legal proceedings  claims and litigation involving us and that such outcome will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition  litigation is inherently uncertain  and there can be no assurance that existing or future litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition or that the current amount of accrued losses is sufficient for any actual losses that may be incurred 
stock option exchange program on february   we announced a voluntary stock option exchange program for our employees 
under the program  ariba employees were given the opportunity to cancel outstanding stock options previously granted to them in exchange for replacement options to be granted at a future date  at least six months and a day from the cancellation date  which was may  on december   the grant of replacement options to participating employees was approved resulting in the issuance of options for approximately million shares of common stock 
each participating employee received  for each option included in the exchange  one replacement option 
the exercise price of each replacement option is per share  which was the fair market value of our common stock on december  the replacement options have terms and conditions that are substantially the same as those of the canceled options 
in the quarter ended june   we recorded million of expense pursuant to the stock option exchange program 
members of our board of directors and our officers and senior executives did not participate in this program 
pro forma financial results we prepare and release quarterly unaudited consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
in the past we have also disclosed and discussed certain pro forma financial information 
this pro forma financial information excluded certain non cash and special charges  consisting primarily of the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets  impairment of goodwill and equity investments  business partner warrants expense  stock based compensation and restructuring and lease abandonment costs 
however  we urged investors to carefully review the financial information prepared in accordance with gaap included as part of our quarterly reports on 
table of contents form q  our annual reports on form k  and our quarterly earnings releases  compare gaap financial information with the pro forma financial results disclosed in our quarterly earnings releases and investor calls  and read the associated reconciliation 
we do not expect to disclose pro forma financial results in the future 
results of operations the following table sets forth the consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated in thousands  except per share data 
these statements have been derived from the consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
the operating results for any period should not be considered indicative of results for any future period

 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendor s products 
these reclassifications  which have no effect on net operating results or earnings per share  do not affect the consolidated financial statements for any period after september  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more detailed information 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents comparison of the fiscal years ended september  and revenues license license revenues for the year ended september  were million  a decrease from license revenues of million for the year ended september  this decrease is primarily attributable to a reduced number of license sales  reflecting the economic slowdown and the significant decline in information technology spending  and a decline in average selling prices  reflecting primarily a different product mix in the year ended september  we have experienced recent declines in deferred revenues that may adversely affect revenues over the long term 
we recognized license revenues of million and million for the years ended september  and  respectively  from softbank  a related party  pursuant to a long term revenue commitment 
these amounts represent and of license revenues for fiscal years and  respectively 
our strategic relationship with softbank has not performed to our expectations 
we have in the past extended the time period over which softbank must provide committed levels of revenue  thereby reducing their quarterly revenue commitments 
softbank is not currently in compliance with the performance levels contemplated by our strategic relationship  and we are currently in discussions to renegotiate our agreements with softbank 
there is no assurance we can achieve a mutually satisfactory amendment of these agreements 
the failure to realize future revenues from softbank at committed levels could have a material adverse impact on our business 
our revenue adjustments described in recent event caused license revenues to increase by  in fiscal year and to decrease by million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year maintenance and service maintenance and service revenues for the year ended september  were million  a decrease from maintenance and service revenues of million for the year ended september  this decrease is primarily attributable to the decline in license sales as noted above  offset by increases in our total installed base of maintenance contracts 
cost of revenues license cost of license revenues for the year ended september  was million  a decrease from cost of license revenues of million for the year ended september  this decrease is primarily related to a reduction in royalties payable to third parties for integrated technology  lower co sale fees due to the reduced number of sales under co marketing arrangements with alliance partners and a reduction in costs associated with major upgrade introductions of our products 
maintenance and service cost of maintenance and service revenues for the year ended september  was million  a decrease from cost of maintenance and service revenues of million year for the ended september  this decrease is primarily attributable to reduced license sales resulting in decreased utilization of internal consultants related to customer implementations  reduced customer support and training costs  a reduction in costs associated with major upgrade introductions of our products and  to a lesser extent  a decrease in headcount 
as part of ariba s increased focus on delivering the ariba spend management solutions to our customers  we have recently begun increasing headcount in our services organization  which will increase cost of maintenance and service revenues in the longer term 

table of contents operating expenses sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses include costs associated with our sales and marketing personnel and product marketing personnel and consist primarily of compensation and benefits  commissions and bonuses  promotional and advertising expenses  travel and entertainment expenses related to these personnel and the provision for doubtful accounts 
sales and marketing expenses for the year ended september  were million  a decrease from sales and marketing expenses of million for the year ended september  the decrease is primarily attributable to the reductions in force in fiscal and in the first quarter of fiscal which resulted in a reduction of personnel and related compensation and benefits  a decrease in bonuses and commissions due to a decline in overall sales activity  the recovery of previously recorded provisions for doubtful accounts based on improved collections experience  and a reduction in our marketing programs for tradeshows and customer advisory council meetings 
during fiscal years and  we added significant provisions to our allowance for doubtful accounts due to the rapid and dramatic decline of the e commerce marketplace industry totaling million and million  respectively 
during fiscal  we determined that some of these reserves were no longer warranted due to improvements in customers financial condition and our ability to settle a number of at risk accounts 
as a result  for fiscal  we recorded a net credit to the provision for doubtful accounts of million 
although the restructuring of our operations in fiscal and fiscal reduced our sales and marketing expenses for fiscal  these expenses may increase over the longer term 
sales and marketing expenses for fiscal have been restated to include million of compensation expense paid by mr 
krach  our chairman and co founder  to mr 
mueller  our president and chief operating officer during a portion of this period 
in addition  mr 
mueller received  of salary  bonus and other compensation paid by us in fiscal research and development research and development expenses include costs associated with the development of new products  enhancements of existing products for which technological feasibility has not been achieved  and quality assurance activities  and primarily include employee compensation and benefits  consulting costs and the cost of software development tools and equipment 
research and development expenses for the year ended september  were million  a decrease from research and development expenses of million for the year ended september  the decrease is primarily attributable to the reductions in force in fiscal and in the first quarter of fiscal which resulted in a reduction of personnel and related compensation and benefits and a decrease in localization of our software  partially offset by an increase for license fees due for the use of third party software 
to date  all software development costs have been expensed in the period incurred 
we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to attaining our strategic objectives 
although the restructuring of operations in fiscal and fiscal reduced our research and development expenses for fiscal  these expenses may increase over the longer term 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits costs for executive  finance and administrative personnel 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended september  were million  a decrease from general and administrative expenses of million for the year ended september  the decrease is primarily attributable to various cost savings initiatives including reductions in personnel and related compensation and benefits  a reduction in implementation costs for financial and human resources infrastructure and a decrease in fees paid to outside professional services providers 
although the restructuring of our operations in fiscal and fiscal reduced our general and administrative expenses for the year ended september   these expenses may increase over the longer term 
over the near term and perhaps for much longer  we expect to incur significant fees and expenses relating to our recently completed accounting review and our ongoing litigation  including litigation relating to the recent restatement of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets our acquisitions of tradingdynamics  tradex and suppliermarket in fiscal were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  we recorded a total of billion in goodwill and other intangible assets representing the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of net assets acquired related to these acquisitions in fiscal the total amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets related to these acquisitions noted above totaled million and million for the years ended september  and  respectively 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded a billion impairment charge relating to goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in the tradex acquisition 
see below for detailed discussion 
the decrease in amortization in fiscal is primarily attributable to the reduction in carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets due to the impairment recorded in fiscal in fiscal  we sold  shares of common stock with a fair market value of million to an independent third party in connection with an intellectual property agreement 
as part of the sale we received intellectual property and million in cash 
the intellectual property is valued at the difference between the fair market value of the stock being exchanged and the cash received  which is million 
this amount is classified within other intangible assets and is being amortized over three years based on the terms of the related intellectual property purchase agreement 
the total amortization of this intellectual property agreement was million for each of the years ended september  and the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets was million and million for the years ended september  and  respectively 
as of september   we had unamortized goodwill and other intangible assets of approximately million 
other intangible assets were being amortized on a straight line basis over their total expected useful lives ranging from two years to three years 
as a result of our adoption of sfas no 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements on october   we ceased amortization of the remaining goodwill that had a net book value of approximately million 
other identifiable intangible assets with a net book value of approximately million at october  will continue to be amortized over their remaining useful lives  substantially all of which expired in the quarter ended march  as a result of the adjustments described in recent event  amortization expense for the years ended september  and has been reduced by million and million  respectively  to reflect changes in purchase accounting related to stock options issued by companies acquired in fiscal year business partner warrants in the past  we have issued warrants for the purchase of our common stock to certain business partners which either vested immediately or vested on a contingent basis upon the achievement of certain milestones related to targeted revenue 
for the years ended september   and  we recognized business partner warrant expense associated with these warrants totaling million  million and million  respectively 
the business partner warrant expense for the years ended september  and excludes million and million  respectively  which has been recorded as a reduction of revenues in accordance with eitf no 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
in march  we issued an unvested warrant to purchase up to  shares of our common stock  of which  shares have expired unexercised and  shares remain unvested as of september  these unvested shares  if they remain unvested  will expire unexercised on a quarterly basis through march the business partner can partially vest in this warrant each quarter upon attainment of certain milestones related to revenue targets 
the warrant can be earned over approximately a five year period 
during the year ended september   the business partner did not vest in any shares of this warrant and accordingly  no business 
table of contents partner warrant expense was recorded 
a total of million and million  respectively  of business partner warrant expense was recorded for the years ended september  and  of which million and  respectively  has been recorded as a reduction of revenues in accordance with eitf no 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
no amounts related to the unvested warrants are reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in april  we entered into an agreement with a third party as part of our vertical industry strategy to obtain a major partner in the financial services industry 
in connection with the agreement  we issued warrants to purchase up to  shares of our common stock 
upon signing of this agreement  warrants for  shares of our common stock with a fair value of million were immediately vested 
the agreement provided that we would receive million in guaranteed gainshare to be paid over a period of two years which we determined to represent partial payment for the vested warrants rather than revenue 
accordingly  million representing the fair value of the vested warrants less the guaranteed gainshare was recorded as an intangible asset related to the strategic relationship to be amortized over the three year term of the agreement 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we determined that the carrying value of the intangible asset was impaired since performance under the agreement was substantially less than expected  and wrote off the remaining net book value of million to business partner warrant expense 
the guaranteed gainshare of million was recorded as a receivable in other current assets 
a total of million and million  respectively  of business partner warrant expense related to this agreement was recorded for the years ended september  and  of which million and million  respectively  was recorded as a reduction of revenues in accordance with eitf no 
during the quarter ended march   the obligation to pay the outstanding balance of million guaranteed gainshare was settled for a cash payment of million received in the quarter ended june  and the cancellation of the remaining unvested warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock 
as a result  we recorded a charge of million representing the uncollected receivable and related settlement costs as business partner warrant expense during the quarter ended march  stock based compensation we have recognized deferred stock based compensation associated with stock options granted to employees at prices below market value on the date of grant  stock options issued to certain employees in conjunction with the consummation of the tradingdynamics and suppliermarket acquisitions in fiscal and the issuance of restricted shares of common stock to certain senior executives  officers and employees 
these amounts are included as a component of stockholders equity and are charged to operations over the vesting period of the options or the lapse of restrictions for the restricted stock  consistent with the method described in fin stock based compensation expense is presented as a separate line item in our consolidated statements of operations  net of the effects of reversals related to terminated employees for cancellation of unvested stock options previously amortized to expense under fin we recorded million of expense in the quarter ended june   representing the unamortized deferred stock based compensation expense of options voluntarily cancelled pursuant to our stock option exchange program 
for the years ended september  and  stock based compensation expense  net of the effects of cancellations  is attributable to various operating expense categories as follows in thousands as restated cost of revenues sales and marketing research and development general and administrative total see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents our changes in the accounting for certain stock options issued by acquired companies caused stock based compensation expense  net of the effect of cancellations  to increase by  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
see recent event 
as of september   we had an aggregate of approximately million of deferred stock based compensation remaining to be amortized through fiscal year restructuring and lease abandonment costs in fiscal year  we initiated a restructuring program to align our expense and revenue levels and to better position us for growth and profitability 
as part of the restructuring program  we restructured our worldwide operations including a worldwide reduction in workforce and the consolidation of excess facilities 
the following table details our accrued restructuring liabilities and related restructuring activity through september  in thousands severance and benefits lease abandonment costs leasehold impairment total accrued restructuring costs as of september  total charge to operating expense cash paid asset impairments applied to asset balances accrued restructuring costs as of september  total charge to operating expense cash paid reclassification of lessee deposits accrued restructuring costs as of september  less current portion accrued restructuring costs  less current portion worldwide workforce reduction severance and benefits primarily include involuntary termination and health benefits  outplacement costs and payroll taxes 
a majority of the terminations  which included sales and marketing  engineering and general and administrative personnel  were completed during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal and in the first quarter of fiscal year during the year ended september   million of severance and benefits costs were paid and million of expense was recorded as a result of involuntary terminations 
as of september   total accrued charges for severance and benefits amounted to approximately  consisting primarily of health benefits and outplacement costs and involuntary termination costs related to our international workforce 
we expect all remaining cash expenditures will be made in the near future 
consolidation of excess facilities lease abandonment costs incurred to date relate to the abandonment of the remaining lease terms of excess leased facilities in mountain view and sunnyvale  california  tampa  florida  alpharetta  georgia  lisle  illinois  burlington  massachusetts  florham park  new jersey  dallas  texas  hong kong and singapore 
total lease abandonment costs include the impairment of leasehold improvements  remaining lease liabilities and brokerage fees offset by estimated sublease income 
the estimated net costs of abandoning these leased facilities  including estimated sublease costs and income  were based on market information trend analyses provided by a commercial real estate brokerage firm retained by us 

table of contents in the quarter ended june   we revised our original estimates and expectations for our corporate headquarters and field offices disposition efforts 
this revision was a result of changed estimates of sublease commencement dates and rental rate projections to reflect continued sharp declines in market conditions in the commercial real estate market in northern california 
based on these factors  and consultation with an independent appraisal firm retained by us  an additional charge to lease abandonment costs of million was recorded in the quarter ended june during the year ended september   we made net cash payments totaling million relating to the abandoned facilities including million for early terminations and reclassified deposits made by lessees totaling million to accrued liabilities 
as of september   million of lease abandonment costs  net of anticipated sublease income of million  remains accrued and is expected to be utilized by fiscal actual sublease payments due to us under noncancelable subleases of excess facilities totaled million as of september   and the remainder of anticipated sublease income represents management s best estimates 
actual future cash requirements and lease abandonment costs may differ materially from the accrual at september   particularly if actual sublease income is significantly different from current estimates 
these differences could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cash position 
for example  a change in assumed market lease rates of per square foot per month for the next years  with all other assumptions remaining the same  would change the estimated lease abandonment loss of our sunnyvale  california headquarters by approximately million 
impairment of goodwill  other intangible assets and equity investments in the quarter ended march   we recorded a billion impairment charge relating to goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in the tradex acquisition as part of an impairment assessment of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets recorded in connection with our various acquisitions 
the assessment was performed primarily due to the significant decline in our stock price  the net book value of assets significantly exceeding our market capitalization  the significant underperformance of this acquisition relative to projections and the overall decline in industry growth rates  which indicated that this trend could continue for an indefinite period 
during the quarters ended march  and september   we determined that certain equity investments in privately held companies had sustained a decline in value that was considered other than temporary 
we recorded a charge to operations of million and million during the quarters ended march  and september   respectively  to write down these investments to their estimated fair values 
there was no impairment charge related to goodwill or other intangible assets recorded in fiscal year an impairment charge of million was recorded to write down equity investments in fiscal year merger related costs on january   we signed a definitive agreement to acquire agile software corporation agile  a provider of collaborative commerce solutions 
however  ariba and agile mutually agreed to terminate their proposed merger without payment of any termination fees due to challenging economic and market conditions 
we incurred costs related to the proposed acquisition totaling million related to financial advisor and other professional fees  which were all expensed during the quarter ended march  our revenue and operating expense adjustments described in recent event reduced previously reported merger related costs by million 
interest income interest income for the year ended september  was million  a decrease of from interest income of million for the year ended september  the decrease was primarily attributable to lower invested cash  cash equivalents and investment balances during fiscal and a decline in interest rates during the year

there is no assurance we can achieve a mutually satisfactory amendment of these agreements

table of contents in connection with restating our consolidated financial statements as discussed above  we treated the settlement of a foreign tax withholding claim as a subsequent event for purposes of our consolidated financial statements for fiscal year as a result  a one time benefit of million included in our preliminary financial statement information for the quarter ended december  announced on january  has been included instead in our consolidated financial statements for fiscal year comparison of the fiscal years ended september  and revenues license license revenues for the year ended september  were million  a increase over license revenues of million for the year ended september  this increase was primarily attributable to continued market acceptance of and demand for our products  an increase in sales to new customers resulting from increased headcount in our sales force  the establishment of several strategic relationships and the expansion of our business domestically and internationally 
this increase  which occurred primarily in the first half of fiscal  was partially offset by a decline in demand for our products in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal resulting in a reduced number of license sales and a modest decline in average selling prices due to an economic slowdown and the significant decline in information technology spending 
our revenue adjustments described in recent event caused license revenues to decrease by million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year maintenance and service maintenance and service revenues for the year ended september  were million  a increase over maintenance and service revenues of million for the year ended september  the increase was primarily attributable to the growth of our licensing activity described above  which has resulted in increased revenues from customer implementations and maintenance contracts and  to a lesser extent  renewals of recurring maintenance and training fees 
cost of revenues license cost of license revenues for the year ended september  was million  an increase of over cost of license revenues of million for the year ended september  the increase in cost of license revenues was primarily related to increased sales volumes  product costs associated with major upgrade introductions of our products  an increase in royalties payable to third parties for integrated technology  and an increase in co sale fees due to higher alliance partner sales occurring primarily in the first half of the fiscal year 
this increase was partially offset by a general decline in demand for our products resulting in a reduction of license sales and the related cost of license revenues in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal maintenance and service cost of maintenance and service revenues for the year ended september  was million  an increase of over cost of maintenance and service revenues of million for the year ended september  the increase was primarily attributable to increased ariba supplier network engineering costs  growth in licensing activity resulting in additional service costs related to customer implementations  customer support and training costs  and costs associated with major upgrade introductions of our products 

table of contents operating expenses sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses for the year ended september  were million  an increase of over sales and marketing expenses of million for the year ended september  the increase was primarily attributable to increased compensation for sales and marketing personnel  domestically and internationally  as a result of increased sales through internal growth and acquisitions  increases in management bonuses  expanded marketing programs for tradeshows and customer advisory council meetings  the expansion of our corporate headquarters and international sales offices  an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts and  to a lesser extent  related overhead 
for the years ended september  and  we recorded provisions for doubtful accounts of million and million  respectively 
provisions for doubtful accounts were increased substantially during the first two quarters of fiscal as a result of the effects of the economic slowdown and its impact on the operations of certain emerging electronic commerce customers together with the rapid increase of sales for all products since the latter part of fiscal as a result  although we did not make significant changes in payment terms  we enhanced our collection efforts and reviewed our credit approval policies

our revenue and operating expense adjustments described in recent event reduced previously reported merger related costs by million 
interest income during the year ended september   interest income was million  an increase of over interest income of million for the year ended september  the increase is attributable to higher average cash balances during fiscal minority interests as of september   minority interest of approximately million was recorded on the consolidated balance sheets in order to reflect the share of the net assets of nihon ariba kk held by minority investors

liquidity and capital resources as of september   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  million in long term investments and million in restricted cash  for total cash and investments of million  and million in working capital 
all significant cash and investments are held in accounts in the united states except for approximately million and million held by nihon ariba kk and ariba korea  ltd  respectively  our majority owned subsidiaries in japan and korea  respectively  in foreign accounts to fund their activities and operations 
as of september   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  million in long term investments and million in restricted cash  for total cash and investments of million  and million in working capital 
our working capital declined million from september  to september   reflecting a reduction of current assets by million primarily due to a million reduction related to transfers of investments to non current investments due to longer maturities  a reduction of million in the current portion of restricted cash due to the release of a security deposit for our headquarters  a million reduction in accounts receivable  and a million reduction in prepaid expenses and other current assets due to the collection and settlement of a business partner receivable 
these reductions were partially offset by a million reduction of current liabilities due to our reduced level of operating expenses 
as a result of the adjustments described in recent event  our consolidated statements of cash flows have been restated to reflect the reclassification of amounts received in connection with business partner warrants from operating activities to financing activities 
the effect of these adjustments is to increase net cash used in operating activities by million and million for fiscal years and  respectively  and to increase net cash provided by financing activities by million and million for fiscal years and  respectively 
net cash used in operating activities was approximately million for the year ended september   compared to million of net cash used in operating activities for the year ended september  net cash used in operating activities for the year ended september  is primarily attributable to decreases in accounts payable  accrued compensation and related liabilities  accrued liabilities and deferred revenue  and to an extent  the net loss for the period less non cash expenses 
these cash flows used in operating activities were partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable and prepaid expenses and other assets and an increase in our restructuring and lease abandonment costs 
net cash provided by investing activities was approximately million for the year ended september  compared to million of net cash used in investing activities for the year ended september  net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended september  is primarily attributable to the redemption of investments  net of purchases 
although the recent restructuring of our operations will reduce our capital expenditures over the near term  these expenditures may increase over the longer term 
net cash provided by financing activities was approximately million for the year ended september  compared to million of net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended september  net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended september  is primarily from the proceeds related to the issuance of business partner warrants and the exercise of stock options 
in march  we entered into a new facility lease agreement for approximately  square feet constructed in four office buildings and an amenities building in sunnyvale  california for our headquarters 
the operating lease term commenced in phases from january through april and ends on january  
table of contents minimum monthly lease payments are million and will escalate annually with the total future minimum lease payments amounting to million over the lease term 
we also contributed million towards leasehold improvement costs of the facility and for the purchase of equipment and furniture  of which approximately million was written off in connection with the abandonment of excess facilities 
in the quarter ended march   a certificate of deposit totaling million as a security deposit for our headquarters was released 
as part of this agreement  we are required to hold certificates of deposit totaling million as of september   as a form of security through fiscal  which is classified as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheets 
future minimum lease payments under all noncancelable capital and operating leases are as follows as of september  in thousands year ending september  capital leases operating leases thereafter total minimum lease payments operating lease payments shown above exclude lease payments due to us under noncancelable subleases of excess facilities  which amounted to million as of september  interest expense related to capital lease obligations is immaterial for all periods presented 
other than the obligations identified above  we do not have any other fixed obligations or commercial commitments under lines of credit  standby repurchase obligations or other such debt arrangements 
we do have standby letters of credit  which are cash collateralized 
these instruments are issued by our banks in lieu of a cash security deposit required by landlords for our real estate leases 
we have approximately million in standby letters of credit related to real estate lease requirements classified as restricted cash on our consolidated balance sheets 
we expect to incur significant operating expenses  particularly research and development and sales and marketing expenses  for the foreseeable future in order to execute our business plan 
we anticipate that such operating expenses  as well as planned capital expenditures  will constitute a material use of our cash resources 
as a result  our net cash flows will depend heavily on the level of future sales  our ability to manage infrastructure costs and the outcomes of our subleasing activities related to the costs of abandoning excess leased facilities and the level of expenditures relating to our recently completed accounting review and ongoing litigation 
additionally  on october   we announced that our board of directors has authorized the repurchase of up to million of our currently outstanding common stock to reduce the dilutive effect of our stock option and purchase plans 
stock purchases under the common stock repurchase program are expected to be made periodically in the open market based on market conditions 
cash flows from operations and existing cash balances may be used to repurchase our common stock 
as a result  we may incur a significant impact on cash flows and cash balances 
although our existing cash  cash equivalents and investment balances together with our anticipated cash flow from operations should be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating resource expenditure requirements for at least the next months  given the significant changes in our business and results of operations in the last to months  the fluctuation in cash  cash equivalents and investments balances may be

see risk factors 
after the next months  we may find it necessary to obtain additional funds 
in the event additional funds are required  we may not be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires that we record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which we incur a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets that resulted from the acquisition  construction  development  and or normal use of the assets 
we would also record a corresponding asset that is depreciated over the life of the asset 
subsequent to the initial measurement of the asset retirement obligation  the obligation will be adjusted at the end of each period to reflect the passage of time and changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the obligation 
our adoption of sfas no 
effective october  did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
however  in the event that we make alterations to certain leased facilities in the future  our landlord may be entitled to require us to restore the property upon termination of the related lease at our expense 
as such  any significant alterations might have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in business combinations completed before july  are amortized until the adoption of sfas no 
 after which only intangible assets with definite useful lives will continue to be amortized 
our adoption of sfas no 
effective on october  did not result in a transitional impairment charge  change of useful lives or residual values of intangible assets acquired  or the reclassification of existing intangible assets to conform with new classification criteria in sfas no 
we will perform an annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
there can be no assurance that at the time the test is completed an impairment charge may not be recorded 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes both sfas statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business as previously defined in that opinion 
sfas no 
retains the fundamental provisions in sfas no 
for recognizing and measuring impairment losses on long lived assets held for use and long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  while also resolving significant implementation issues associated with sfas for example  sfas no 
provides guidance on how a long lived asset that is used as part of a group should be evaluated for impairment  establishes criteria for when a long lived asset is held for sale  and prescribes the accounting for a long lived asset that will be disposed of other than by sale 
sfas no 
retains the basic provisions of apb no 
on how to present discontinued operations in the statement of operations but broadens that presentation to include a component of an entity rather than a segment of a business 
unlike sfas no 
an impairment assessment under sfas no 
will never result in a write down of goodwill 
rather  goodwill is evaluated for impairment under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
effective october  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements

sfas no 
revises the accounting for specified employee and contract terminations that are part of 
table of contents restructuring activities and nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity 
companies will be able to record a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity only when the liability is incurred and can be measured at fair value 
commitment to an exit plan or a plan of disposal expresses only management s intended future actions and therefore does not meet the requirement for recognizing a liability and related expense 
sfas no 
only applies to termination benefits offered for a specific termination event or a specified period 
it will not affect accounting for the costs to terminate a capital lease 
we are required to adopt sfas no 
for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  we are evaluating this new standard but expect that the effects of adoption  if any  would relate solely to exit or disposal activities undertaken in the future

fin also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of fin are applicable to guarantees issued or modified after december  and are not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk we develop products in the united states and market our products in the united states  latin america  europe  middle east  canada  australia and asia 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
since the majority of our sales are currently made in us dollars  a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
if any of the events described above were to occur  our net sales could be seriously impacted  since a significant portion of our net sales are derived from international operations 
for the years ended september   and  approximately  and  respectively  of our total net sales were derived from customers outside of the united states 
as a result  our us dollar earnings and net cash flows from international operations may be adversely affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 

table of contents we use derivative instruments to manage risks associated with foreign currency transactions in order to minimize the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on earnings 
we utilize forward contracts to reduce our net exposures  by currency  related to the monetary assets and liabilities of our foreign operations denominated in local currency 
in addition  from time to time  we may enter into forward exchange contracts to establish with certainty the us dollar amount of future firm commitments denominated in a foreign currency 
the forward contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and accordingly  all of these instruments are marked to market at each balance sheet date by a charge to other income expense 
we believe that these forward contracts do not subject us to undue risk due to foreign exchange movements because gains and losses on these contracts are generally offset by losses and gains on the underlying assets and liabilities 
we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
all contracts have a maturity of less than one year 
the following table provides information about our foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding as of september  in thousands contract value unrealized gain loss in usd foreign currency buy sell currency usd swiss francs buy singapore dollars buy european currency units buy the unrealized gain loss represents the difference between the contract value and the market value of the contract based on market rates as of september  we had no foreign exchange forward contracts in place prior to fiscal given our foreign exchange position  a ten percent change in foreign exchange rates upon which these forward exchange contracts are based would result in unrealized exchange gains and losses of approximately  in all material aspects  these exchange gains and losses would be fully offset by exchange losses and gains on the underlying net monetary exposures for which the contracts are designated as hedges 
we do not expect material exchange rate gains and losses from other foreign currency exposures 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
this is accomplished by investing in widely diversified investments  consisting only of investment grade securities such as debt  equity or both 
we do hold investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments  and both carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities  which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
our investments may fall short of expectations due to changes in market conditions and as such we may suffer losses at the time of sale due to the decline in market value 
all investments in the table below are carried at market value  which approximates cost 

table of contents the table below represents principal or notional amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity of our investment portfolio in thousands  except for interest rates
