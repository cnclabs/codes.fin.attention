for more information on related party transactions  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  requires the partnership to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
the partnership regularly and continually evaluates its estimates  including those related to acquiring  developing and assessing the carrying values of its real estate properties and its investments in and advances to joint ventures 
the partnership bases its estimates on historical experience  current market conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  principles of consolidation 
revenue recognition revenues from rental properties are recognized when due from tenants 
residential leases are generally for terms of one year  and commercial leases are generally for five to ten years  with renewal options at increased rents 
significant commercial leases with stepped increases over the term of the lease are recorded on the straight line basis 
real estate and depreciation real estate assets are stated at the lower of cost or fair value  less accumulated depreciation 
costs related to the acquisition  development  construction and improvement of properties are capitalized  including interest  internal wages and benefits  real estate taxes and insurance 
capitalization usually begins with commencement of development activity and ends when the property is ready for leasing 
replacements and improvements such as hvac equipment  structural replacements  windows  appliances  flooring  carpeting  kitchen bath replacements and renovations are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives as follows depreciation is computed on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets 
in assessing estimated useful lives  the partnership makes assumptions based on historical experience acquired from both within and outside the partnership 
these assumptions have a direct impact on the partnership s net income 
ordinary repairs and maintenance  such as unit cleaning and painting and appliance repairs  are expensed 
if there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates an impairment in the value of a property  the partnership s policy is to assess the impairment by making a comparison of the current and projected operating cash flows of the property over its remaining useful life  on an undiscounted basis  to the carrying amount of the property 
if the carrying value is in excess of the estimated projected operating cash flows of the property  the partnership would recognize an impairment loss equivalent to the amount required to adjust the carrying amount to its estimated fair value 
the partnership has not recognized an impairment loss since with respect to investments in and advances to joint ventures  the partnership looks to the underlying properties to assess performance and the recoverability of carrying amounts for those investments in a manner similar to direct investments in real estate properties 
an impairment charge is recorded if the carrying value of the investment exceeds its fair value 
legal contingencies the partnership is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise  from time to time  in the ordinary course of business 
these matters are frequently covered by insurance 
if it is determined that a loss is likely to occur  the estimated amount of the loss is recorded in the financial statements 
both the amount of the loss and the point at which its occurrence is considered likely can be difficult to determine

the partnership is subject to the general economic risks affecting the real estate industry  such as dependence on tenants financial condition and the need to enter into new leases or renew leases on terms favorable to tenants in order to generate rental revenues 
the partnership is also impacted by changing economic conditions making alternative housing arrangements more or less attractive to the partnership s tenants  such as the interest rates on single family home mortgages and the availability and purchase price of single family homes in the greater boston metropolitan area 
the partnership is subject to increases in heating and utility costs that may arise as a result of economic and market conditions and fluctuations in seasonal weather conditions 
the partnership may fail to identify  acquire  construct or develop additional properties  may develop or acquire properties that do not produce a desired or expected yield on invested capital  may be unable to sell poorly performing or otherwise undesirable properties quickly  or may fail to effectively integrate acquisitions of properties or portfolios of properties 
financing or refinancing of partnership properties may not be available to the extent necessary or desirable  or may not be available on favorable terms 
given the nature of the real estate business  the partnership is subject to potential environmental liabilities 
these include environmental contamination in the soil at the partnership s or neighboring real estate  whether caused by the partnership  previous owners of the subject property or neighbors of the subject property  and the presence of hazardous materials in the partnership s buildings  such as asbestos  mold and radon gas 
management is not aware of any material environmental liabilities at this time 
insurance coverage for and relating to commercial properties is increasingly costly and difficult to obtain 
in addition  insurance carriers have excluded certain specific items from standard insurance policies  which have resulted in increased risk exposure for the partnership

since the partnership s long term goals include the acquisition of additional properties  a portion of the proceeds from the refinancing and sale of properties is reserved for this purpose

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   the partnership and its subsidiary partnerships collectively have approximately  in long term debt  all of which earns interest at fixed rates 
accordingly  the fair value of these debt instruments is affected by changes in the market interest rates 
the recent decline in market interest rates has had a negative impact  but the partnership has determined that  at this time  the benefit it would obtain by refinancing its various mortgage debts would be outweighed by the prepayment penalties that would come due upon such refinancings 
for information regarding the fair values and maturity dates of these debt obligations  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements
