item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is included to describe the company s financial position and results of operations for each of the previous three years in the period ended december  the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with this discussion 
general we are building a product driven biopharmaceutical company  focused primarily on oncology  by developing and commercializing a portfolio of novel treatments for both early and late stage cancers 
we are leveraging our core competencies in clinical drug development to identify  develop and commercialize our proprietary product candidate pipeline 
our lead product  campath  has been approved in the united states and europe for treating patients with refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia and is distributed by schering ag and its us subsidiary  berlex laboratories  inc berlex 
campath was developed in a partnership with millennium pharmaceuticals  inc millennium 
in december  we acquired millennium s equity interest in the partnership 
this transaction has helped streamline the process of developing campath in additional indiciations 
in addition to campath  we have four oncology product candidates in clinical trials  as well as several active preclinical programs 
to date  we have built this pipeline primarily through the licensing and acquisition of promising drug candidates 
in addition to our clinical development programs  we conduct drug discovery research  translational research and preclinical studies in the fields of angiogenesis inhibition  molecular receptor chemistry and targeted medicinal phosphonate chemistry 
we have incurred losses and had an accumulated deficit through december  of million 
our losses have resulted primarily from product research and development activities  including in licensing of products for which we pay fees  and related administrative expenses 
we expect to continue to incur losses in our revenue for the foreseeable future will be limited to our profit participation and royalty revenue  product development revenue  interest income  and other miscellaneous income 
currently the revenues recorded in product profit and royalty revenue consist of our profit share from net us sales of campath and royalty revenue from rest of world sales 
participation from our distribution and development partner for services performed and costs incurred in connection with the development of campath for all indications are recorded as product development revenues 
indications for which the development of campath is ongoing include chronic lymphocytic leukemia cll  multiple sclerosis ms and non hodgkins lymphoma nhl 
prior to january   we accounted for campath activities as follows our operating revenue included product development revenue we received from the partnership  our research and development expenses included all of the development costs for campath  which were largely offset by the revenue we received from the partnership  our portion of the profits resulting from campath sales and the other revenues and expenses of the partnership was recorded in equity in income loss of joint venture 
in november  we completed an underwritten public offering of our common stock pursuant to which we sold million shares 
the number of shares sold includes the underwriters exercise of their overallotment option 
proceeds  net of offering costs  to us from this offering were approximately million 
the net proceeds from this offering have been and will continue to be used to fund a portion of the acquisition of millennium s partnership interest in the partnership 
the balance of the net proceeds will be used to expand clinical trials and preclinical research  to fund research and development programs  for potential licenses or other acquisitions of complementary technologies or products  for general corporate purposes and for working capital 
on october   we entered into an agreement with millennium pharmaceuticals  inc to purchase millennium s interest in the partnership for a total purchase price of approximately million based on the net present value of the required cash payments  discounted at  our estimated incremental borrowing rate on the date of the purchase 
the terms of the agreement required an initial cash payment of million and an additional million in scheduled payments over the following three years 
the first of these scheduled payments of million in cash was made on december  additionally  million is due in and  of which million in each of those years may be paid with our common stock  at our option and subject to certain terms and conditions 
in and  million of the million is due days following the calendar quarter in which net us campath sales exceed a certain level 
in addition  millennium will be entitled to royalties based upon net us campath sales above certain levels in and continuing through

annual report on form k in march  we entered a definitive agreement to co develop clofarabine  a nucleoside analog  with bioenvision inc we paid million upon execution of the agreement and may be required to make future payments in accordance with the agreement if certain drug development milestones are met 
in clinical studies  clofarabine has shown promise as a potential new treatment for patients with hematological malignancies  including acute lymphocytic leukemia all and acute myelogenous leukemia aml  and in preclinical studies  for solid tumors 
we are taking the lead role in developing clofarabine in the us and canada  where we will have exclusive manufacturing and marketing rights in exchange for the afore mentioned million in licensing fee  milestone payments and royalties 
bioenvision will retain the lead role in developing the compound in europe  where it will have exclusive manufacturing and marketing rights and we will have rights to royalties 
in february  we acquired symphar and its research platform in medicinal chemistry and nuclear receptor biology  which has led to drug candidates in several therapeutic fields  including cardiovascular and bone disease 
the symphar acquisition  combined with our preclinical signal transduction and angiogenesis inhibition programs in boston  gives us the capability to translate early stage research leads into clinical drug development programs 
under the terms of the agreement  we acquired symphar for million  including million in cash and  shares of our common stock 
critical accounting policies we believe that our most critical accounting issues include the process we use to evaluate an impairment on the intangible assets acquired in the purchase of millennium s interest in the partnership and the process of determining the amount of in process research and development obtained in an acquisition 
the amounts recorded as completed technology and trademark were determined based on an independent appraisal of the estimated timing and amount of revenue to be generated from sales of campath 
amounts recorded as in process research and development are based upon assumptions and estimates regarding the amount and timing of projected revenues and costs as well as the appropriate discount rates and expected trends in technology 
no assurance can be given  however  that the underlying assumptions used to estimate revenue  development costs or profitability or the events associated with such projects will transpire as estimated 
for these reasons  actual results may vary from projected results 
the most significant and uncertain assumptions relating to the in process projects relate to the projected timing of completion and revenues attributable to each project
