item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following financial review and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal years ended june   and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements  and other detailed information appearing in this document 
general we are a diversified financial services organization operating predominantly in the eastern and central portions of the united states 
through our principal direct and indirect subsidiaries  we originate  sell and service home equity and business purpose loans 
we also process and purchase home equity loans through our bank alliance services program 
our loans primarily consist of fixed interest rate loans secured by first or second mortgages on one to four family residences 
our customers are primarily credit impaired borrowers who are generally unable to obtain financing from banks or savings and loan associations and who are attracted to our products and services 
we originate loans through a combination of channels including a national processing center located at our centralized operating office in philadelphia  pennsylvania and a regional processing center in roseland  new jersey 
our centralized operating office was located in bala cynwyd  pennsylvania prior to july  prior to june  we also originated home equity loans through several retail branch offices 
effective june   we no longer originate loans through retail branch offices 
our loan servicing and collection activities are performed at our bala cynwyd  pennsylvania office  but we expect to relocate these activities to our philadelphia office 
in addition  we offer subordinated debt securities to the public  the proceeds of which are used for repayment of existing debt  loan originations  our operations including repurchases of delinquent assets from securitization trusts  investments in systems and technology and for general corporate purposes 
recent development fiscal loss of million 
in fiscal  we recorded a net loss of million 
the loss was primarily due to our inability to complete our typical quarterly securitization of loans during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year and to million of pre tax charges for net valuation adjustments on our securitization assets charged to the income statement  compared to million of net valuation adjustments in fiscal our business strategy requires the sale of substantially all of the loans we originate at least on a quarterly basis through a combination of securitizations and whole loan sales 
from until the fourth quarter of fiscal  we had elected to utilize securitization transactions extensively due to the favorable conditions we had experienced in the securitization markets and the higher gains recorded on securitizations through the application of gain on sale accounting versus the gain realized on whole loan sales 
during fiscal  we charged to the income statement total pre tax valuation adjustments on our interest only strips and servicing rights  which we refer to as securitization assets  of million  which primarily reflect the impact of higher than anticipated prepayments on securitized loans experienced in fiscal due to the low interest rate environment experienced during fiscal the pre tax valuation adjustments charged to the income statement were partially offset by million due to the impact of a decrease in the discount rates used to value our securitization assets  resulting in the million of pre tax charges for net valuation adjustments charged to the income statement 
we reduced the discount rates on our interest only strips and our servicing rights primarily to reflect the impact of the sustained decline in market interest rates 
the discount rate on the projected residual cash flows from our interest only strips was reduced from to at june  the discount rate used to determine the fair value of the overcollateralization portion of the cash flows from our interest only strips was minimally impacted by the decline in interest rates and remained at on average 
as a result  the blended rate used to value our interest only strips  including the overcollateralization cash flows  was at june  the discount rate on our servicing rights was reduced from to at june  our inability to complete our typical publicly underwritten securitization during the fourth quarter of fiscal was the result of our investment bankers decision in late june not to underwrite the contemplated june securitization transaction 
management believes that a number of factors contributed to this decision  including a highly publicized lawsuit finding liability of an underwriter in connection with the securitization of loans for another unaffiliated subprime lender  an inquiry by the us attorney s office in philadelphia regarding our forbearance practices  an anonymous letter regarding the company received by our investment bankers  the sec s recent enforcement action against another unaffiliated subprime lender related to its loan restructuring practices and related disclosure  a federal regulatory agency investigation of practices by another subprime servicer and our investment bankers prior experience with securitization transactions with non affiliated originators 
short term liquidity and remedial steps taken 
because we have historically experienced negative cash flows from operations  our business requires continual access to short and long term sources of debt to generate the cash required to fund our operations 
our short term liquidity was negatively impacted by several recent events 
our inability to complete our typical publicly underwritten securitization during the fourth quarter of fiscal contributed to our loss for fiscal and adversely impacted our short term liquidity position 
in addition  further advances under a non committed portion of one of our credit facilities were subject to the discretion of the lender and subsequent to june   there were no new advances under the non committed portion 
additionally  on august   this credit facility was amended and  among other changes  the non committed portion was eliminated 
we also had a million mortgage conduit facility with a financial institution that enabled us to sell our loans into an off balance sheet facility  which expired pursuant to its terms on july  at june   of the million in revolving credit and conduit facilities available to us  million was drawn upon 
at september   of the million in revolving credit facilities available to us  million was drawn upon 
our revolving credit facilities and mortgage conduit facility had million of unused capacity available at june  and million of unused capacity at september   which significantly reduced our ability to fund future loan originations until we sell existing loans  extend or expand existing credit facilities  or add new credit facilities 
in addition  we have temporarily discontinued sales of new subordinated debt  which further impaired our liquidity 
as a result of these liquidity issues  since june   we substantially reduced our loan origination volume 
from july  through august   we originated million of loans which represents a significant reduction as compared to originations of million of loans for the same period in fiscal our inability to originate loans at previous levels may adversely impact the relationships our subsidiaries have or are developing with their brokers and our ability to retain employees 
as a result of the decrease in loan originations and liquidity issues described above  we anticipate incurring a loss for the first quarter of fiscal the amount of the loss will depend  in part  upon our ability to complete a securitization prior to september  and  if completed  the size and terms of the securitization 
further  we can provide no assurances that we will be able to sell our loans  extend existing facilities or expand or add new credit facilities 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing  we may not be able to restructure our business to permit profitable operations or repay our subordinated debt when due 
even if we are able to obtain adequate financing  our inability to securitize our loans could hinder our ability to operate profitably in the future and repay our subordinated debt when due 
we undertook specific remedial actions to address short term liquidity concerns including entering into an agreement on june  with an investment bank to sell up to million of mortgage loans  subject to the satisfactory completion of the purchaser s due diligence review and other conditions  and soliciting bids and commitments from other participants in the whole loan sale market 
in total  from june  through september   we sold approximately million which includes million of loans sold by the expired mortgage conduit facility of loans through whole loan sales 
we are continuing the process of selling our loans 
we also suspended paying quarterly cash dividends on our common stock 
on september   we entered into definitive agreements with a financial institution for a new million credit facility for the purpose of funding our loan originations 
pursuant to the terms of this facility  we are required to  among other things i obtain a written commitment for another credit facility of at least million and close that additional facility by october  which condition would be satisfied by the closing of the million facility described below  ii have a net worth of at least million by september   with quarterly increases of million thereafter  iii apply of our net cash flow from operations each quarter to reduce the outstanding amount of subordinated debt commencing with the quarter ending march   and iv provide a parent company guaranty of of the outstanding principal amount of loans under the facility 
prior to the closing of the second facility  our borrowing capacity on this million credit facility is limited to million 
this facility has a term of months expiring in september and is secured by the mortgage loans which are funded by advances under the facility with interest equal to libor plus a margin 
this facility is subject to representations and warranties and covenants  which are customary for a facility of this type  as well as amortization events and events of default related to our financial condition 
these provisions require  among other things  our maintenance of a delinquency ratio for the managed portfolio at the end of each fiscal quarter of less than  our subordinated debt not to exceed million at any time  our ownership of an amount of repurchased loans not to exceed of the managed portfolio and our registration statement registering million of subordinated debt be declared effective by the sec no later than october  on september   we executed a commitment letter for a mortgage warehouse credit facility with a warehouse lender  which consists of a senior secured revolving credit facility of up to million and a secured last out revolver facility up to million to fund loan originations 
the commitment letter is subject to certain conditions  including  among other things i entering into definitive agreements  except as provided in the commitment letter  ii the absence of a material adverse change in the business  operations  property  condition financial or otherwise or prospects of us or our affiliates  and iii our receipt of another credit facility in an amount not less than million  subject to terms and conditions acceptable to this lender which condition is satisfied by the new million facility described above 
the commitment letter provides that these facilities will have a term of three years with an interest rate on amounts outstanding under the million portion of the credit facility equal to the greater of one month libor plus a margin or the difference between the yield maintenance fee as defined in the commitment letter and the one month libor plus a margin 
advances under this facility would be collateralized by substantially all of our present and future assets including pledged loans and a security interest in substantially all of our interest only strips and residual interests which will be contributed to a special purpose entity organized by us to facilitate this transaction 
we also agreed to pay fees of approximately million annually plus a nonusage fee based on the difference between the average daily outstanding balance for the current month and the maximum credit amount under the facility and the lender s out of pocket expenses 
we anticipate that these facilities will be subject to representations and warranties  events of default and covenants which are customary for facilities of this type  as well as our agreement to i maintain sales or renewals of our subordinated debt securities of million per month  ii restrict total principal and interest outstanding on our subordinated debt to million or less  iii make quarterly reductions commencing in april of an amount of subordinated debt outstanding to be determined  iv maintain maximum interest rates payable on subordinated debt securities not to exceed percentage points above comparable rates for fdic insured products  and v the lender s receipt of our audited financial statements for the period ended june  the definitive agreements will grant the lender an option at any time after the first anniversary of entering into definitive agreements to increase the credit amount on the million facility to million with additional fees payable by us plus additional interest as may be required by the institutions or investors providing the lender with these additional funds 
the commitment letter requires that we enter into definitive agreements not later than october  while we anticipate that we will close this transaction prior to such date  we cannot assure you that these negotiations will result in definitive agreements or that such agreements  as negotiated  will be on terms and conditions acceptable to us 
in the event we are unable to close these facilities or another facility within the time frame provided under the new million credit facility described above  the lender on that facility would be under no obligation to make further advances under the terms of that facility and outstanding advances would have to be repaid over a period of time 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we explored a number of strategic alternatives to address these liquidity issues in the event we are unable to borrow under the new million credit facility  close the million credit facilities or obtain alternative financing 
in the event we were unable to obtain the additional credit facilities necessary to operate our business  we developed a contingent business plan described more fully under business strategy adjustments which contemplates  among other things  the sale of million principal amount of additional subordinated debt through march and the renewal of approximately of outstanding subordinated debt upon maturity 
we believe that this contingent business plan addresses our liquidity issues and may permit us to restructure our operations  if necessary  without the receipt of an expanded or additional credit facility 
there can be no assurance that our contingent business plan will be successful or that it will enable us to repay our subordinated debt when due 
to the extent that we are not successful in maintaining  replacing or obtaining alternative financing sources on acceptable terms  we may have to limit our loan originations  sell loans earlier than intended and further restructure our operations 
limiting our originations or earlier than intended sales of our loans could reduce our profitability or result in losses and restrict our ability to repay our subordinated debt upon maturity 
while we currently believe that we would be able to restructure our operations  if necessary  we cannot assure you that such restructuring will enable us to attain profitable operations or repay the subordinated debt when due 
see risk factors we depend upon the availability of financing to fund our continuing operations 
any failure to obtain adequate funding could hurt our ability to operate profitably and restrict our ability to repay our subordinated debt and negatively impact the value of our common stock 
and risk factors if we are unable to obtain additional financing  we may be not able to restructure our business to permit profitable operations or repay our subordinated debt when due  which would negatively impact the value of our common stock 
credit facilities and waivers related to financial covenants 
we borrow against various warehouse credit facilities as the primary funding source for our loan originations 
the sale of our loans through a securitization or whole loan sale generates the cash proceeds necessary to repay the borrowings under the warehouse facilities 
in addition  we have the availability of revolving credit facilities  which we may use to fund our operations 
each credit agreement requires that we comply with specific financial covenants and has multiple individualized financial covenant thresholds and ratio limits that we must meet as a condition to drawing on that particular facility 
pursuant to the terms of these credit facilities  the failure to comply with the financial covenants constitutes an event of default and the lender may  at its option  take certain actions including terminate commitments to make future advances to us  declare all or a portion of the loan due and payable  foreclose on the collateral securing the loan  require servicing payments be made to the lender  or other third party  or assume the servicing of the loans securing the credit facility 
an event of default under these credit facilities could result in defaults pursuant to cross default provisions of our other agreements  including our other loan agreements and lease agreements 
the failure to comply with the terms of these credit facilities or to obtain the necessary waivers from the lenders related to any default would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources  could result in us not having sufficient cash to repay our indebtedness  require us to restructure our operations and may force us to sell assets on less than optimal terms and conditions 
as a result of the loss experienced during fiscal  we were not in compliance with the terms of certain of the financial covenants under two of our principal credit facilities one for million and the other for million  of which million was non committed and we requested and obtained waivers of these requirements from our lenders 
the lender under the million warehouse credit facility has granted us a waiver for our non compliance with a financial covenant in that credit facility through september  this facility was amended to reduce the available credit to million and the financial covenants were replaced with new covenants with which we are currently in compliance 
we also entered into an amendment to the million credit facility which provides for the waiver of our non compliance with the financial covenants in that facility  the reduction of the committed portion of this facility from million to million  the elimination of the million non committed portion of this credit facility and the acceleration of the termination date of this facility from november to september  our ability to repay this facility upon termination is dependent on our ability to refinance the loans in one of our new facilities or our sale of loans currently warehoused in the terminating facility by september  in addition  if the anticipated loss for the first quarter of fiscal described above results in our non compliance with any financial covenants  we intend to seek the appropriate waivers 
there can be no assurances that we will obtain any of these waivers 
business strategy adjustments 
our business strategy requires the sale of substantially all of the loans we originate at least on a quarterly basis through a combination of securitizations and whole loan sales 
our determination as to whether to dispose of loans through securitizations or whole loan sales depends on a variety of factors including market conditions  profitability and cash flow considerations 
from until the fourth quarter of fiscal  we had elected to utilize securitization transactions extensively due to the favorable conditions we had experienced in the securitization markets 
during fiscal   and  we securitized billion  billion  and billion of loans  respectively 
during the same periods  we sold million  million  and million of loans  respectively  through whole loan sales 
under generally accepted accounting principles  we are permitted to record the gain on the sale of these securitized loans utilizing an accounting method referred to as gain on sale accounting 
this accounting method permits us to record a non cash gain based upon the estimated value of securitization assets generated in connection with the securitization of our loans even though only a small portion of the gain is received in cash during the period the gain is recorded 
we are then required to reevaluate these assets quarterly and make adjustments based upon changes in the fair value of these assets 
after we recognized our inability to securitize our assets in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we adjusted our business strategy to emphasize more whole loan sales 
we intend to continue to evaluate both public and privately placed securitization transactions  subject to market conditions 
we generally realized higher gain on sale in our securitization transactions than on whole loan sales for cash 
although the gain on whole loan sales is generally significantly lower than gains realized in securitization transactions  we receive the gain in cash immediately and generally receive more cash immediately in a whole loan sale transaction than from securitizations of an equal principal amount of loans 
as a result of the emphasis on whole loan sales in late june and july  at july   our cash position was consistent with our projected cash position  which assumed the completion of a fourth quarter securitization 
the use of whole loan sales will enable us to immediately generate cash flow  protect against volatility in the securitization markets and reduce risks inherent in retaining securitization assets 
however  unlike securitizations  where we retain servicing rights  and receive interest only strips  which generate future cash flows  whole loan sales are typically structured as a sale with servicing rights released and do not result in our receipt of interest only strips 
as a result  using whole loan sales more extensively in the future will reduce our income from servicing activities and limit the amount of securitization assets created 
we believe that our adjustments to our business strategy focus on a more diversified strategy of selling our loans  while protecting revenues  controlling costs and improving liquidity 
however  if we are unable to generate sufficient liquidity through the sales of our loans  the sale of our subordinated debt  the receipt of new credit facilities or a combination of the foregoing  we will be required to restrict loan originations and make additional changes to our business strategy  including restricting or restructuring our operations which could reduce our profitability or result in losses and impair our ability to repay the subordinated debt 
we have historically experienced negative cash flow from operations 
to the extent we are unable to successfully implement our adjusted business strategy  which requires access to capital to originate loans and our ability to profitably sell these loans  we would continue to experience negative cash flows from operations which would impair our ability to repay our subordinated debt 
see risk factors if we are unable to successfully implement our adjusted business strategy which focuses on whole loan sales  we may be unable to attain profitable operations which could impair our ability to repay our subordinated debt and negatively impact the value of our common stock 
in the event we are unable to maintain the new million credit facility described above  close the million credit facilities described above within the required timeframes or obtain other credit facilities  we have developed a contingent business plan which management believes will enable us to repay the subordinated debt when due and continue operations  although with a materially reduced amount of loan originations as compared to historical levels 
the major assumptions of our contingent business plan include  but are not limited to  the following i the sale of million of subordinated debt over a five month period ending in march  ii the renewal of approximately of our outstanding subordinated debt upon maturity  iii the securitization of approximately million of business purpose loans which are less attractive to purchasers in the secondary loan market  iv the sale of substantially all of the home equity loans we originate in whole loan sales in the secondary market with servicing released  and v substantial cost reductions in our operations 
if we utilize the contingent business plan  we currently anticipate incurring losses through the second quarter of fiscal although management believes that the contingent business plan is feasible  there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement it 
civil subpoena from the us attorney s office 
we received a civil subpoena  dated may   from the civil division of the us attorney for the eastern district of pennsylvania 
the subpoena requests that we provide certain documents and information with respect to us and our lending subsidiaries for the period from may  to may  i all loan files in which we entered into a forbearance agreement with a borrower who is in default  ii the servicing  processing  foreclosing  and handling of delinquent loans and non performing loans  the carrying  processing and sale of real estate owned  and forbearance agreements  and iii agreements to sell or otherwise transfer mortgage loans including  but not limited to  any pooling or securitization agreements or to obtain funds to finance the underwriting  origination or provision of mortgage loans  any transaction in which mortgage loans were sold or transferred  any instance in which we were not to service or not to act as custodian for a mortgage loan  representations and warranties made in connection with mortgage loans  secondary market loan sale schedules  and credit loss  delinquency  default  and foreclosure rates of mortgage loans 
we have directed our attorneys to cooperate fully with this inquiry 
currently  this inquiry appears to be focused on our practices relating to obtaining forbearance agreements from delinquent borrowers who would otherwise be subject to foreclosure 
because the inquiry is at a preliminary stage  we cannot reach any conclusions about the ultimate scope of the inquiry or the potential liability or financial consequences to us at this time 
to the extent management is unsuccessful in resolving this matter  the ongoing review by the us attorney s office could limit our ability to engage in publicly underwritten securitization transactions or otherwise sell or service our loans 
in addition  the us attorney s inquiry could reduce sales of subordinated debt upon which we rely to fund our operations and limit our ability to obtain additional credit facilities  which are necessary for the implementation of our business strategy 
furthermore  the us attorney could impose sanctions or otherwise restrict our ability to restructure loans  which could negatively impact our profitability and our ability to repay the subordinated debt 
delinquencies  forbearance and deferment arrangements 
during fiscal  we experienced an increase in the total delinquencies in our total managed portfolio to million at june  from million and million at june  and  respectively 
total delinquencies loans and leases  excluding real estate owned  with payments past due for more than days as a percentage of the total managed portfolio were at june  compared to and at june  and  respectively 
as the managed portfolio continues to season and if our economy continues to lag or worsen  the delinquency rate may continue to increase  which could negatively impact our ability to sell or securitize loans and reduce our profitability and the funds available to repay our subordinated debt 
continuing low market interest rates could continue to encourage borrowers to refinance their loans and increase the levels of loan prepayments we experience which would negatively impact our delinquency rate 
delinquencies in our total managed portfolio do not include million of previously delinquent loans at june   which are subject to deferment and forbearance arrangements 
generally  a loan remains current after we enter into a deferment or forbearance arrangement with the borrower only if the borrower makes the principal and interest payments as required under the terms of the original note exclusive of the delinquent payments advanced or fees paid by us on the borrower s behalf as part of the deferment or forbearance arrangement and we do not reflect it as a delinquent loan in our delinquency statistics 
however  if the borrower fails to make principal and interest payments  the account will generally be declared in default and collection actions resumed 
during the final six months of fiscal  we experienced a pronounced increase in the number of borrowers under deferment arrangements than in prior periods 
at june   there was approximately million of cumulative unpaid principal balance under deferment and forbearance arrangements as compared to approximately million of cumulative unpaid principal balance at june  total cumulative unpaid principal balances under deferment or forbearance arrangements as a percentage of the total managed portfolio were at june  compared to at june  additionally  there are loans under deferment and forbearance arrangements which have returned to delinquent status 
at june  there was million of cumulative unpaid principal balance under deferment arrangements and million of cumulative unpaid principal balance under forbearance arrangements that are now reported as delinquent days or more 
business strategy the business strategy that we are emphasizing beginning in fiscal focuses on a shift from gain on sale accounting and the use of securitization transactions as our primary method of selling loans to a more diversified loan sale strategy which utilizes a combination of whole loan sales and securitizations  while protecting revenues  controlling costs and improving liquidity 
our business strategy includes the following o selling substantially all of the loans we originate on at least a quarterly basis through a combination of securitizations and whole loan sales 
whole loan sales may be completed on a more frequent basis 
o shifting from a predominantly publicly underwritten securitization strategy and gain on sale business model to a strategy focused on a combination of whole loan sales and smaller securitization transactions 
quarterly loan securitization levels will be reduced significantly from previous levels 
securitizations for the foreseeable future are expected to be executed as private placements to institutional investors or publicly underwritten securitizations  subject to market conditions 
historically  the market for whole loan sales has provided reliable liquidity for numerous originators as an alternative to securitization 
whole loan sales provide immediate cash premiums to us  while securitizations generate cash over time but generally result in higher gains at the time of sale 
we intend to rely less on gain on sale accounting and loan servicing activities for our revenue and earnings and will rely more on cash premiums earned on whole loan sales 
this strategy is expected to result in relatively lower earnings levels at current loan origination volumes  but will increase cash flow  accelerate the timeframe for becoming cash flow positive and improve our liquidity position 
see liquidity and capital resources for more detail on cash flow 
o broadening our mortgage loan product line and increasing loan originations 
we currently originate primarily fixed rate loans 
under our business strategy  we plan to originate adjustable rate and alt a mortgage loans as well as a wide array of fixed rate mortgage loans in order to appeal to a broader base of prospective customers and increase loan originations 
o offering competitive interest rates charged to borrowers on new products 
by offering competitive interest rates charged on new products  we expect to originate loans with higher credit quality 
in addition  by offering competitive interest rates we expect to appeal to a wider customer base and substantially reduce our marketing costs  make more efficient use of marketing leads and increase loan origination volume 
o reducing origination of the types of loans that are not well received in the whole loan sale and securitization markets 
we intend to reduce the level of business purpose loans that we will originate  but we will continue to originate business purpose loans to meet demand in the whole loan sale and securitization markets 
o reducing the cost of loan originations 
we have implemented plans to eliminate our high cost origination branches 
reduce the cost to originate in upland mortgage by a broadening the product line and offering competitive interest rates in order to increase origination volume  b reducing marketing costs  and c developing broker relationships 
reduce the cost to originate in american business mortgage services by increasing volume through a broadening of the mortgage loan product line 
reduce the cost to originate in the bank alliance services program by broadening our product line and increasing the amount of fees we charge to participating financial institutions 
o reducing the amount of outstanding subordinated debt 
the increase in cash flow expected under our business strategy is expected to accelerate a reduction in our reliance on issuing subordinated debt to meet our liquidity needs and allow us to begin to pay down existing subordinated debt 
o reducing operating costs 
since june   we reduced our workforce by employees 
with our shift in focus to whole loan sales  with servicing released  and offering a broader mortgage product line that we expect will appeal to a wider array of customers  we currently require a smaller employee base with fewer sales  servicing and support positions 
these workforce reductions represent more than a decrease in staffing levels 
our business strategy is expected to leverage our demonstrated strengths which include o a strong credit culture which consistently originates quality performing loans 
our delinquency rates are among the lowest in the subprime industry 
o long term broker relationships at american business mortgage services 
o upland mortgage brand identity 
o relationships with participating financial institutions in the bank alliance services program 
o institutional investors interest in the bonds issued in our securitizations 
our business strategy is dependent on our ability to emphasize lending related activities that provide us with the most economic value 
the implementation of this strategy will depend in large part on a variety of factors outside of our control  including  but not limited to  our ability to obtain adequate financing on favorable terms and to profitably securitize or sell our loans on a regular basis 
our failure with respect to any of these factors could impair our ability to successfully implement our strategy  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
see risk factors if we are unable to continue to successfully implement our adjusted business strategy  which focuses on whole loan sales  we may be unable to attain profitable operations  which could impair our ability to repay our subordinated debt and negatively impact the value of our common stock 
legal and regulatory considerations local  state and federal legislatures  state and federal banking regulatory agencies  state attorneys general offices  the federal trade commission  the us department of justice  the us department of housing and urban development and state and local governmental authorities have increased their focus on lending practices by companies in the subprime lending industry  more commonly referred to as predatory lending practices 
state  local and federal governmental agencies have imposed sanctions for practices including  but not limited to  charging borrowers excessive fees  imposing higher interest rates than the borrower s credit risk warrants  failing to adequately disclose the material terms of loans to the borrowers and abusive servicing and collections practices 
as a result of initiatives such as these  we are unable to predict whether state  local or federal authorities will require changes in our lending practices in the future  including reimbursement of fees charged to borrowers  or will impose fines on us 
these changes  if required  could impact our profitability 
these laws and regulations may limit our ability to securitize loans originated in some states or localities due to rating agency  investor or market restrictions 
as a result  we have limited the types of loans we offer in some states and may discontinue originating loans in other states or localities 
we received a civil subpoena  dated may   from the civil division of the us attorney for the eastern district of pennsylvania 
see recent developments and risk factors the inquiry regarding our forbearance practices by the us attorney could result in concerns regarding our loan servicing and limit our ability to sell or service our loans  sell subordinated debt  or obtain additional credit facilities  which would hinder our ability to operate profitably and repay our subordinated debt  which would negatively impact the value of our common stock 
additionally  the united states congress is currently considering a number of proposed bills or proposed amendments to existing laws  such as the ney lucas responsible lending act of introduced on february  into the us house of representatives  which could affect our lending activities and make our business less profitable 
these bills and amendments  if adopted as proposed  could reduce our profitability by limiting the fees we are permitted to charge  including prepayment fees  restricting the terms we are permitted to include in our loan agreements and increasing the amount of disclosure we are required to give to potential borrowers 
while we cannot predict whether or in what form congress may enact legislation  we are currently evaluating the potential impact of these legislative initiatives  if adopted  on our lending practices and results of operations 
in addition to new regulatory initiatives with respect to so called predatory lending practices  current laws or regulations in some states restrict our ability to charge prepayment penalties and late fees 
we have used the federal alternative mortgage transactions parity act of  which we refer to as the parity act  to preempt these state laws for loans which meet the definition of alternative mortgage transactions under the parity act 
however  the office of thrift supervision has adopted a rule effective in july  which precludes us and other non bank  non thrift creditors from using the parity act to preempt state prepayment penalty and late fee laws on new loan originations 
under the provisions of this rule  we are required to modify or eliminate the practice of charging prepayment and other fees in some of the states where we originate loans 
we are continuing to evaluate the impact of the adoption of the new rule by the office of thrift supervision on our future lending activities and results of operations 
we currently expect that the percentage of home equity loans containing prepayment fees that we will originate in the future will decrease to approximately to  from to prior to this rule becoming effective 
additionally  in a recent decision  the appellate division of the superior court of new jersey determined that the parity act s preemption of state law was invalid and that the state laws precluding some lenders from imposing prepayment fees are applicable to loans made in new jersey  including alternative mortgage transactions 
although this new jersey decision is subject to appeal and may not be final  we are currently evaluating its impact on our future lending activities in the state of new jersey and results of operations 
we are also subject  from time to time  to private litigation  including actual and purported class action suits 
we expect that  as a result of the publicity surrounding predatory lending practices and the recent new jersey court decision regarding the parity act  we may be subject to other class action suits in the future 
see risk factors our residential lending business is subject to government regulation and licensing requirements  as well as private litigation  which may hinder our ability to operate profitably and repay our subordinated debt  which would negatively impact the value of our common stock 
although we are licensed or otherwise qualified to originate loans in states  our loan originations are concentrated in the eastern half of the united states 
the concentration of loans in a specific geographic region subjects us to the risk that a downturn in the economy or recession in the eastern half of the country would more greatly affect us than if our lending business were more geographically diversified 
as a result  an economic downturn or recession in this region could result in reduced profitability 
see risk factors an economic downturn or recession in the eastern half of the united states could hinder our ability to operate profitably  which would reduce the funds available to repay the subordinated debt and negatively impact the value of our common stock 
application of critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  referred to as gaap 
the accounting policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to understanding our financial condition and results of operations 
the application of these accounting policies requires significant judgment and assumptions by management  which are based upon historical experience and future expectations 
the nature of our business and our accounting methods make our financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations highly dependent on management s estimates 
the line items on our income statement and balance sheet impacted by management s estimates are described below 
revenue recognition 
revenue recognition is highly dependent on the application of statement of financial accounting standards  referred to as sfas in this document  no 
accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities and gain on sale accounting to our quarterly loan securitizations 
gains on sales of loans through securitizations for the fiscal year ended june  were of total revenues 
securitization gains represent the difference between the net proceeds to us  including retained interests in the securitization  and the allocated cost of loans securitized 
the allocated cost of loans securitized is determined by allocating their net carrying value between the loans  the interest only strips and the servicing rights we retain based upon their relative fair values 
estimates of the fair values of the interest only strips and the servicing rights we retain are discussed below 
we believe the accounting estimates related to gain on sale are critical accounting estimates because more than in fiscal and of the securitization gains were based on estimates of the fair value of retained interests 
the amount recognized as gain on sale for the retained interests we receive as proceeds in a securitization  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  is highly dependent on management s estimates 
interest only strips 
interest only strips  which represent the right to receive future cash flows from securitized loans  represented of our total assets at june  and are carried at their fair values 
fair value is based on a discounted cash flow analysis which estimates the present value of the future expected residual cash flows and overcollateralization cash flows utilizing assumptions made by management at the time the loans are sold 
these assumptions include the rates used to calculate the present value of expected future residual cash flows and overcollateralization cash flows  referred to as the discount rates  and expected prepayment and credit loss rates on pools of loans sold through securitizations 
we believe the accounting estimates used in determining the fair value of interest only strips are critical accounting estimates because estimates of prepayment and credit loss rates are made based on management s expectation of future experience  which is based in part  on historical experience  current and expected economic conditions and in the case of prepayment rate assumptions  consideration of the impact of changes in market interest rates 
the actual loan prepayment rate may be affected by a variety of economic and other factors  including prevailing interest rates  the availability of alternative financing to borrowers and the type of loan 
we re evaluate expected future cash flows from our interest only strips on a quarterly basis 
we monitor the current assumptions for prepayment and credit loss rates against actual experience and other economic and market conditions and we adjust assumptions if deemed appropriate 
even a small unfavorable change in our assumptions made as a result of unfavorable actual experience or other considerations could have a significant adverse impact on our estimate of residual cash flows and on the value of these assets 
in the event of an unfavorable change in these assumptions  the fair value of these assets would be overstated  requiring an accounting adjustment 
in accordance with the provisions of emerging issues task force guidance on issue  recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interests in securitized financial assets  referred to as eitf in this document  changes in the fair value of interest only strips that are deemed to be temporary changes are recorded through other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity 
other than temporary adjustments to decrease the fair value of interest only strips are recorded through the income statement which would adversely affect our income in the period of adjustment 
during fiscal  we recorded total pre tax valuation adjustments on our interest only strips of million  of which  in accordance with eitf  million was charged to the income statement and million was charged to other comprehensive income 
the valuation adjustment reflects the impact of higher than anticipated prepayments on securitized loans experienced in fiscal due to the low interest rate environment experienced during fiscal  which has impacted the entire mortgage industry 
the valuation adjustment on interest only strips for fiscal was reduced by a million favorable valuation impact as a result of reducing the discount rates applied in valuing the interest only strips at june  the amount of the valuation adjustment charged to the income statement was reduced by a million favorable valuation impact as a result of reducing the discount rates and the charge to other comprehensive income was reduced by million for the favorable impact of reducing discount rates 
the discount rates were reduced at june  primarily to reflect the impact of the sustained decline in market interest rates 
the discount rate on the projected residual cash flows from our interest only strips was reduced from to at june  the discount rate used to determine the fair value of the overcollateralization portion of the cash flows from our interest only strips was minimally impacted by the decline in interest rates and remained at on average 
as a result  the blended rate used to value our interest only strips  including the overcollateralization cash flows  was at june  see securitizations discount rates for more detail 
see off balance sheet arrangements securitizations for more detail on the estimation of the fair value of interest only strips and the sensitivities of these balances to changes in assumptions and the impact on our financial statements of changes in assumptions 
see risk factors our estimates of the value of interest only strips and servicing rights we retain when we securitize loans could be inaccurate and could limit our ability to operate profitably and impair our ability to repay our subordinated debt  which would negatively impact the value of our common stock 
interest accretion income represents the yield component of cash flows received on interest only strips 
we use a prospective approach to estimate interest accretion 
as previously discussed  we update estimates of residual cash flow from our securitizations on a quarterly basis 
under the prospective approach  when it is probable that there is a favorable or unfavorable change in estimated residual cash flow from the cash flow previously projected  we recognize a larger or smaller percentage of the cash flow as interest accretion 
any change in value of the underlying interest only strip could impact our current estimate of residual cash flow earned from the securitizations 
for example  a significant change in market interest rates could increase or decrease the level of prepayments  thereby changing the size of the total managed loan portfolio and related projected cash flows 
the managed portfolio includes loans held as available for sale on our balance sheet and loans serviced for others 
servicing rights 
servicing rights  which represent the rights to receive contractual servicing fees from securitization trusts and ancillary fees from borrowers  net of adequate compensation that would be required by a substitute servicer  represented of our total assets at june  servicing rights are carried at the lower of cost or fair value 
the fair value of servicing rights is determined by computing the benefits of servicing in excess of adequate compensation  which would be required by a substitute servicer 
the benefits of servicing are the present value of projected net cash flows from contractual servicing fees and ancillary servicing fees 
we believe the accounting estimates used in determining the fair value of servicing rights are critical accounting estimates because the projected cash flows from servicing fees incorporate assumptions made by management  including prepayment rates  credit loss rates and discount rates 
these assumptions are similar to those used to value the interest only strips retained in a securitization 
we monitor the current assumptions for prepayment and credit loss rates against actual experience and other economic and market conditions and we adjust assumptions if deemed appropriate 
even a small unfavorable change in our assumptions  made as a result of unfavorable actual experience or other considerations could have a significant adverse impact on the value of these assets 
in the event of an unfavorable change in these assumptions  the fair value of these assets would be overstated  requiring an adjustment  which would adversely affect our income in the period of adjustment 
during fiscal  we recorded total pre tax valuation adjustments on our servicing rights of million  which was charged to the income statement 
the valuation adjustment reflects the impact of higher than anticipated prepayments on securitized loans experienced in fiscal due to the low interest rate environment experienced during fiscal the valuation adjustment on servicing rights for fiscal was reduced by a million favorable valuation impact as a result of reducing the discount rate applied in valuing the servicing rights at june  the discount rate was reduced at june  primarily to reflect the impact of the sustained decline in market interest rates 
the discount rate on our servicing rights was reduced from to at june  see securitizations servicing rights for more detail 
see off balance sheet arrangements securitizations for more detail on the estimation of the fair value of servicing rights and the sensitivities of these balances to changes in assumptions and the impact on our financial statements of changes in assumptions 
amortization of the servicing rights asset for securitized loans is calculated individually for each securitized loan pool and is recognized in proportion to  and over the period of  estimated future servicing income on that particular pool of loans 
a review for impairment is performed on a quarterly basis by stratifying the serviced loans by loan type  which is considered to be the predominant risk characteristic 
if our analysis indicates the carrying value of servicing rights is not recoverable through future cash flows from contractual servicing and other ancillary fees  a valuation allowance or write down would be required 
during fiscal  our valuation analysis indicated that valuation adjustments of million were required for impairment of servicing rights due to higher than expected prepayment experience 
the write downs were recorded in the income statement 
impairment is measured as the excess of carrying value over fair value 
allowance for loan and lease losses 
the allowance for loan and lease losses is maintained primarily to account for loans and leases that are delinquent and are expected to be ineligible for sale into a future securitization and for delinquent loans that have been repurchased from securitization trusts 
the allowance is calculated based upon management s estimate of our ability to collect on outstanding loans and leases based upon a variety of factors  including  periodic analysis of the available for sale loans and leases  economic conditions and trends  historical credit loss experience  borrowers ability to repay  and collateral considerations 
additions to the allowance arise from the provision for credit losses charged to operations or from the recovery of amounts previously charged off 
loan and lease charge offs reduce the allowance 
if the actual collection of outstanding loans and leases is less than we anticipate  further write downs would be required which would reduce our net income in the period the write down was required 
development of critical accounting estimates 
on a quarterly basis  senior management reviews the estimates used in our critical accounting policies 
as a group  senior management discusses the development and selection of the assumptions used to perform its estimates described above 
management has discussed the development and selection of the estimates used in our critical accounting policies as of june  with the audit committee of our board of directors 
in addition  management has reviewed its disclosure of the estimates discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations with the audit committee

initial adoption of accounting policies 
in conjunction with the relocation of our corporate headquarters to new leased office space  we have entered into a lease agreement and are in the process of finalizing certain governmental grant agreements that will provide us with reimbursement for certain expenditures related to our office relocation 
the reimbursable expenditures include both capitalizable items for leasehold improvements  furniture and equipment and expense items such as legal costs  moving costs and employee communication programs 
amounts reimbursed to us in accordance with our lease agreement will be initially recorded as a liability on our balance sheet and will be amortized in the income statement on a straight line basis over the term of the lease as a reduction of rent expense 
amounts received from government grants will be initially recorded as a liability 
grant funds received to offset expenditures for capitalizable items will be reclassified as a reduction of the related fixed asset and amortized to income over the depreciation period of the related asset as an offset to depreciation expense 
amounts received to offset expense items will be recognized in the income statement as an offset to the expense item 
in fiscal we entered into a derivative financial instrument contract  which we have not designated as an accounting hedge and therefore is accounted for as a trading asset or liability 
this contract was designed to reduce our exposure to changes in the fair value of certain interest only strips due to changes in the one month london inter bank offered rate  referred to in this document as libor 
the structure of certain securitization trusts includes a floating interest rate tranche based on one month libor plus an interest rate spread 
floating interest rate tranches in a securitization expose us to gains or losses due to changes in the fair value of the interest only strip from changes in the floating interest rate paid to the certificate holders 
in order to manage this exposure we have entered into an interest rate swap agreement 
the swap agreement requires a net cash settlement on a monthly basis of the difference between the fixed interest rate on the swap and the libor paid on the certificates 
the fair value of this swap agreement is based on estimated market values for the sale of the contract provided by a third party 
as of june   the unrealized loss in the fair value of this derivative financial instrument was million and an additional million in net cash settlements were paid on the contract during fiscal our interest only strips are held as available for sale securities and therefore changes in the fair value of the interest only strips are recorded as a component of equity unless the fair value of the interest only strip falls below its cost basis  which would require a write down through current period income 
see interest rate risk management strategies for use of derivative financial instruments for further details of this interest rate swap agreement 
impact of changes in critical accounting estimates in prior fiscal years 
discount rates 
during fiscal  a write down of million was recorded on our interest only strips  of which million was due to a change in the discount rate used to value our interest only strips 
at june   we increased the discount rate applicable to the residual portion of our interest only strips from to 
no changes were made in the discount rate used to determine the fair value of the overcollateralization portion of the cash flows from our interest only strips 
the change in the discount rate was considered to be an other than temporary fair value adjustment and was recorded as expense in fiscal the factors that led to this other than temporary decline in fair value of our interest only strips included o sustained increase in market interest rates through the fourth quarter of fiscal  o increases in the all in cost of our mortgage loan trust investor certificates from september through june  o increases in the cost of funding our interest only strips  particularly the interest rate paid on subordinated debt  and o events and conditions in the mortgage lending industry and the actions by others in that industry 
prepayment rates 
during the nine month period ended october  the percentage of home equity loans that we originated containing prepayment fees increased from less than of loans originated to over  a percentage which has been maintained since that time 
due to this increase in the volume of loans originated with prepayment fees  we had reduced the initial annual prepayment rate assumption on business loans and lengthened the initial assumptions used for the prepayment ramp period on home equity loans from to months beginning with the mortgage loan securitization through the mortgage loan securitization and to months beginning with the mortgage loan securitization 
our experience indicated that when a loan has a prepayment fee provision  fewer borrowers will prepay  and those prepaying will do so more slowly 
our actual cumulative prepayment experience through march  demonstrated that only of home equity loans having prepayment fees were actually prepaid by the borrowers  while of home equity loans without prepayment fees were prepaid 
this cumulative historical performance demonstrates that it was nearly twice as likely that a loan without a prepayment fee would be prepaid 
the effect of these changes in prepayment rate assumptions increased the gains on securitizations for fiscal in the third quarter of fiscal  we evaluated our accumulated experience with pools of loans that had a high percentage of loans with prepayment fees 
we had begun using a static pool analysis of prepayments  whereby we analyzed historical prepayments by period  to determine average prepayments expected by period 
for business purpose loans  we found that prepayments for the first year are generally lower than we had anticipated  peak at a higher rate than previously anticipated by month and decline by month home equity loan prepayments generally ramped faster in the first year than we had anticipated but leveled more slowly over months and to a lower final rate than we had been using previously 
we utilized this information to modify our loan prepayment rates and ramp periods to better reflect the amount and timing of expected prepayments 
the effect of these changes implemented in the third quarter of fiscal was a net reduction in the value of our interest only strips of million or less than and an insignificant net impact on securitization gains for fiscal the effect on the interest only strips of this change in assumptions was recorded through an adjustment to comprehensive income in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
credit loss rates 
in fiscal  the initial credit loss assumptions beginning with the mortgage loan securitization were increased as a result of an increase in the percentage of second mortgage loans originated and our concerns regarding high levels of real estate values 
the average percentage of first mortgage loans securitized had declined approximately from the fiscal securitizations to the fiscal securitizations 
high real estate values also affected our loss assumptions because in the event of an economic downturn  the loan to value ratios of the loans could be understated 
both of these factors increased the potential that the underlying real estate collateral would not be sufficient to satisfy the loan if a foreclosure were required 
although our percentage of first mortgages has subsequently increased  we believe real estate values may limit our ability to maintain the credit loss experience realized in prior securitizations 
the effect of these changes in credit loss assumptions reduced the gains on securitizations in fiscal by approximately million 
off balance sheet arrangements we use off balance sheet arrangements extensively in our business activities 
the types of off balance sheet arrangements we use include special purpose entities for the securitization of loans  obligations we incur as the servicer of securitized loans and other contractual obligations such as operating leases for corporate office space 
see liquidity and capital resources for additional information regarding our off balance sheet contractual obligations 
special purpose entities and off balance sheet facilities are used in our mortgage loan securitizations 
asset securitizations are one of the most common off balance sheet arrangements in which a company transfers assets off of its balance sheet by selling them to a special purpose entity 
we sell our loans into off balance sheet facilities to generate the cash to pay off revolving credit facilities and to generate revenue through securitization gains 
the special purpose entities described below meet our objectives for mortgage loan securitization structures and comply with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
our securitizations involve a two step transfer that qualifies for sale accounting under sfas no 
first  we sell the loans to a special purpose entity  which has been established for the limited purpose of buying and reselling the loans and establishing a true sale under legal standards 
next  the special purpose entity sells the loans to a qualified special purpose entity  which we refer to as the trust 
the trust is a distinct legal entity  independent from us 
by transferring title of the loans to the trust  we isolate those assets from our assets 
finally  the trust issues certificates to investors to raise the cash purchase price for the loans we have sold 
cash from the sale of certificates to third party investors is returned to us in exchange for our loan receivables and we use this cash  in part  to repay any borrowings under warehouse and credit facilities 
the off balance sheet trusts activities are restricted to holding title to the loan collateral  issuing certificates to investors and distributing loan payments to the investors and us in accordance with the relevant agreement 
in each securitization  we also retain the right to service the loans 
we have no additional obligations to the off balance sheet facilities other than those required as servicer of the loans and for breach of covenants or warranty obligations 
we are not required to make any additional investments in the trusts 
under current accounting rules  the trusts do not qualify for consolidation in our financial statements 
the trusts carry the loan collateral as assets and the certificates issued to investors as liabilities 
residual cash from the loans after required principal and interest payments are made to the investors and after payment of certain fees and expenses provides us with cash flows from our interest only strips 
we expect that future cash flows from our interest only strips and servicing rights will generate more of the cash flows required to meet maturities of our subordinated debt and our operating cash needs 
we retain the rights to service the loans we sell through securitizations 
as the servicer of securitized loans  we are obligated to advance interest payments for delinquent loans if we deem that the advances will ultimately be recoverable 
these advances can first be made out of funds available in a trust s collection account 
if the funds available from the collection account are insufficient to make the required interest advances  then we are required to make the advance from our operating cash 
the advances made from a trust s collection account  if not recovered from the borrower or proceeds from the liquidation of the loan  require reimbursement from us 
these advances may require funding from our capital resources and may create greater demands on our cash flow than either selling loans with servicing released or maintaining a portfolio of loans on our balance sheet 
however  any advances we make on a mortgage loan from our operating cash can be recovered from the subsequent mortgage loan payments to the applicable trust prior to any distributions to the certificate holders 
at june  and june   the mortgage securitization trusts held loans with an aggregate principal balance due of billion and billion as assets and owed billion and billion to third party investors  respectively 
revenues from the sale of loans to securitization trusts were million  or of total revenues for the fiscal year ended june  and million  or of total revenues for the fiscal year ended june  these amounts are net of million in fiscal and million in fiscal of expenses for underwriting fees  legal fees and other expenses associated with securitization transactions during the periods 
we have interest only strips and servicing rights with fair values of million and million  respectively at june   which represent of our total assets 
cash flows received from interest only strips and servicing rights were million for the fiscal year ended june  and million for the fiscal year ended june  these amounts are included in our operating cash flows 
we also used special purpose entities in our sales of loans to a million off balance sheet mortgage conduit facility 
sales into the off balance sheet facility involved a two step transfer that qualified for sale accounting under sfas no 
 similar to the process described above 
this facility had a revolving feature and could be directed by the third party sponsor to dispose of the loans 
typically  the loans were disposed of by securitizing the loans in a term securitization 
the third party note purchaser also has the right to have the loans sold in whole loan sale transactions 
under this off balance sheet facility arrangement  the loans have been isolated from us and our subsidiaries and as a result  transfers to the facility were treated as sales for financial reporting purposes 
when loans were sold to this facility  we assessed the likelihood that the sponsor would transfer the loans into a term securitization 
as the sponsor had typically transferred the loans to a term securitization prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal  the amount of gain on sale we had recognized for loans sold to this facility was estimated based on the terms we would obtain in a term securitization rather than the terms of this facility 
for the fourth quarter of fiscal  the likelihood that the facility sponsor would ultimately transfer the underlying loans to a term securitization was significantly reduced and the amount of gain recognized for loans sold to this facility was based on terms expected in a whole loan sale transaction 
our ability to sell loans into this facility expired pursuant to its terms on july  at june   the off balance sheet mortgage conduit facility held loans with principal balances due of million as assets and owed million to third parties 
through september   million of the loans in the facility at june  were sold in whole loan sales as directed by the facility sponsor 
securitizations in our mortgage loan securitizations  pools of mortgage loans are sold to a trust 
the trust then issues certificates or notes  which we refer to as certificates in this document  to third party investors  representing the right to receive a pass through interest rate and principal collected on the mortgage loans each month 
these certificates  which are senior in right to our interest only strips in the trusts  are sold in public or private offerings 
the difference between the weighted average interest rate that is charged to borrowers on the fixed interest rate pools of mortgage loans and the weighted average pass through interest rate paid to investors is referred to as the interest rate spread 
the interest rate spread after payment of certain fees and expenses and subject to certain conditions is distributed from the trust to us and is the basis of the value of our interest only strips 
in addition  when we securitize our loans we retain the right to service the loans for a fee  which is the basis for our servicing rights 
servicing includes processing of mortgage payments  processing of disbursements for tax and insurance payments  maintenance of mortgage loan records  performance of collection efforts  including disposition of delinquent loans  foreclosure activities and disposition of real estate owned  referred to as reo  and performance of investor accounting and reporting processes 
declines in securitization pass through interest rates resulted in interest rate spreads improving by approximately basis points from the fourth quarter of fiscal securitization  to our most recent securitization in the third quarter of fiscal increased interest rate spreads resulted in increases in the residual cash flow we expect to receive on securitized loans  the amount we received at the closing of a securitization from the sale of notional bonds or premiums on investor certificates and corresponding increases in the gains we recognized on the sale of loans in a securitization 
no assurances can be made that market interest rates will remain at current levels or that we can complete securitizations in the future 
however  in a rising interest rate environment and under our business strategy we would expect our ability to originate loans at interest rates that will maintain our most recent level of securitization gain profitability to become more difficult than during a stable or falling interest rate environment 
we would seek to address the challenge presented by a rising interest rate environment by carefully monitoring our product pricing  the actions of our competition  market trends and the use of hedging strategies in order to continue to originate loans in as profitable a manner as possible 
see strategies for use of derivative financial instruments for a discussion of our hedging strategies 
a rising interest rate environment could unfavorably impact our liquidity and capital resources 
rising interest rates could impact our short term liquidity by limiting our ability to sell loans at favorable premiums in whole loan sales  widening investor interest rate spread requirements in pricing future securitizations  increasing the levels of overcollateralization in future securitizations  limiting our access to borrowings in the capital markets and limiting our ability to sell our subordinated debt securities at favorable interest rates 
in a rising interest rate environment  short term and long term liquidity could also be impacted by increased interest costs on all sources of borrowed funds  including the subordinated debt  and by reducing interest rate spreads on our securitized loans  which would reduce our cash flows 
see liquidity and capital resources for a discussion of both long and short term liquidity 
these effects may be offset to some degree by the positive effect of a decline in prepayment activity that we would expect in a rising interest rate environment 
see liquidity and capital resources for a discussion of both long and short term liquidity 
conversely  a declining interest rate environment could unfavorably impact the valuation of our interest only strips 
in a declining interest rate environment the level of mortgage refinancing activity tends to increase  which could result in an increase in loan prepayment experience and may require increases in assumptions for prepayments for future periods 
after a two year period during which management s estimates required no valuation adjustments to our interest only strips and servicing rights  declining interest rates and high prepayment rates over the last seven quarters have required revisions to management s estimates of the value of these retained interests 
beginning in the second quarter of fiscal and on a quarterly basis thereafter  we increased the prepayment rate assumptions used to value our securitization assets  thereby decreasing the fair value of these assets 
however  because our prepayment rates as well as those throughout the mortgage industry continued to remain at higher than expected levels due to continuous declines in interest rates during this period to year lows  our prepayment experience exceeded even our revised assumptions 
as a result  over the last seven quarters we have recorded cumulative pre tax write downs to our interest only strips in the aggregate amount of million and pre tax adjustments to the value of servicing rights of million  for total adjustments of million  mainly due to our higher than expected prepayment experience 
of this amount  million was expensed through the income statement and million resulted in a write down through other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity 
during fiscal  we recorded total pre tax valuation adjustments on our securitization assets of million  of which million was charged to the income statement and million was charged to other comprehensive income 
the breakout of the total adjustments in fiscal between interest only strips and servicing rights was a follows o we recorded total pre tax valuation adjustments on our interest only strips of million  of which  in accordance with eitf  million was charged to the income statement and million was charged to other comprehensive income 
the valuation adjustment reflects the impact of higher than anticipated prepayments on securitized loans experienced in fiscal due to the low interest rate environment experienced during fiscal  which has impacted the entire mortgage industry 
the valuation adjustment on interest only strips for fiscal was reduced by a million favorable valuation impact as a result of reducing the discount rates applied in valuing the interest only strips at june  the amount of the valuation adjustment charged to the income statement was reduced by a million favorable valuation impact as a result of reducing the discount rates and the charge to other comprehensive income was reduced by million for the favorable impact of reducing discount rates 
the discount rates were reduced at june  primarily to reflect the impact of the sustained decline in market interest rates 
the discount rate on the projected residual cash flows from our interest only strips was reduced from to at june  the discount rate used to determine the fair value of the overcollateralization portion of the cash flows from our interest only strips was minimally impacted by the decline in interest rates and remained at on average 
as a result  the blended rate used to value our interest only strips  including the overcollateralization cash flows  was at june  o we recorded total pre tax valuation adjustments on our servicing rights of million  which was charged to the income statement 
the valuation adjustment reflects the impact of higher than anticipated prepayments on securitized loans experienced in fiscal due to the low interest rate environment experienced during fiscal the valuation adjustment on servicing rights for fiscal was reduced by a million favorable valuation impact as a result of reducing the discount rate applied in valuing the servicing rights at june  the discount rate was reduced at june  primarily to reflect the impact of the sustained decline in market interest rates 
the discount rate on our servicing rights was reduced from to at june  the long duration of historically low interest rates has given borrowers an extended opportunity to engage in mortgage refinancing activities which resulted in elevated prepayment experience 
the persistence of historically low interest rate levels  unprecedented in the last years  has made the forecasting of prepayment levels in future fiscal periods difficult 
we had assumed that the decline in interest rates had stopped and a rise in interest rates would occur in the near term 
consistent with this view  we had utilized derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk exposure on our loan production and loan pipeline to protect the fair value of these fixed rate items against potential increases in market interest rates 
based on current economic conditions and published mortgage industry surveys including the mortgage bankers association s refinance indexes available at the time of our quarterly revaluation of our interest only strips and servicing rights  and our own prepayment experience  we believe prepayments will continue to remain at higher than normal levels for the near term before returning to average historical levels 
the mortgage bankers association of america has forecast as of june  that mortgage refinancings as a percentage share of total mortgage originations will decline from in the first quarter of calendar to in the first quarter of calendar and to in the second quarter of calendar the mortgage bankers association of america has also projected in its june economic forecast that the year treasury rate which generally affects mortgage rates will increase over the next three quarters 
as a result of our analysis of these factors  we have increased our prepayment rate assumptions for home equity loans for the near term  but at a declining rate  before returning to our historical levels 
however  we cannot predict with certainty what our prepayment experience will be in the future 
any unfavorable difference between the assumptions used to value our securitization assets and our actual experience may have a significant adverse impact on the value of these assets

the business strategy of selling loans through securitizations and whole loan sales requires building an inventory of loans over time  during which time we incur costs and expenses 
since a gain on sale is not recognized until a securitization is closed or whole loan sale is settled  which may not occur until a subsequent quarter  operating results for a given quarter can fluctuate significantly 
if securitizations or whole loan sales do not close when expected  we could experience a material adverse effect on our results of operations for a quarter 
see liquidity and capital resources for a discussion of the impact of securitizations and whole loan sales on our cash flow 
several factors affect our ability to complete securitizations on a profitable basis 
these factors include conditions in the securities markets  such as fluctuations in interest rates described below  conditions in the asset backed securities markets relating to the loans we originate  credit quality of the managed portfolio of loans or potential changes to the legal and accounting principles underlying securitization transactions 
interest only strips 
as the holder of the interest only strips  we are entitled to receive excess or residual cash flows and cash flows from overcollateralization 
these cash flows are the difference between the payments made by the borrowers on securitized loans and the sum of the scheduled and prepaid principal and pass through interest paid to trust investors  servicing fees  trustee fees and  if applicable  surety fees 
in most of our securitizations  surety fees are paid to an unrelated insurance entity to provide credit enhancement for the trust investors 
generally  all residual cash flows are initially retained by the trust to establish required overcollateralization levels in the trust 
overcollateralization is the excess of the aggregate principal balances of loans in a securitized pool over the aggregate principal balance of investor interests 
overcollateralization requirements are established to provide credit enhancement for the trust investors 
the overcollateralization requirements for a mortgage loan securitization are different for each securitization and include the initial requirement  if any  which is a percentage of the original unpaid principal balance of loans securitized and is paid in cash at the time of sale  the final target  which is a percentage of the original unpaid principal balance of loans securitized and is funded from the monthly excess cash flow 
specific securitizations contain provisions requiring an increase above the final target overcollateralization levels during periods in which delinquencies exceed specified limits 
the overcollateralization levels return to the target levels when delinquencies fall below the specified limits  and the stepdown requirement  which is a percentage of the remaining unpaid principal balance of securitized loans 
during the stepdown period  the overcollateralization amount is gradually reduced through cash payments to us until the overcollateralization balance declines to a specific floor 
the stepdown period generally begins at the later of to months after the initial securitization of the loans or when the remaining balance of securitized loans is less than of the original balance of securitized loans 
the fair value of our interest only strips is a combination of the fair values of our residual cash flows and our overcollateralization cash flows 
at june   investments in interest only strips totaled million  including the fair value of overcollateralization related cash flows of million 
trigger management 
repurchasing delinquent loans from securitization trusts benefits us by allowing us to limit the level of delinquencies and losses in the securitization trusts and as a result  we can avoid exceeding specified limits on delinquencies and losses that trigger a temporary reduction or discontinuation of cash flow from our interest only strips until the delinquency or loss triggers are no longer exceeded 
we have the right  but are not obligated  to repurchase a limited amount of delinquent loans from securitization trusts 
in addition  we elect to repurchase loans in situations requiring more flexibility for the administration and collection of these loans 
the purchase price of a delinquent loan is at the loan s outstanding contractual balance 
a foreclosed loan is one where we  as servicer  have initiated formal foreclosure proceedings against the borrower and a delinquent loan is one that is days or more past due 
the foreclosed and delinquent loans we typically elect to repurchase are usually days or more delinquent and the subject of foreclosure proceedings  or where a completed foreclosure is imminent 
the related allowance for loan losses on these repurchased loans is included in our provision for credit losses in the period of repurchase 
our ability to repurchase these loans does not disqualify us for sale accounting under sfas no 
 which was adopted on a prospective basis in the fourth quarter of fiscal  or other relevant accounting literature because we are not required to repurchase any loan and our ability to repurchase a loan is limited by contract 
at june   none of our mortgage securitization trusts were under a triggering event  an improvement from three trusts at march  for the fiscal year ended june   we repurchased delinquent loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance of million from securitization trusts primarily for trigger management 
if delinquencies increase and we cannot cure the delinquency or liquidate the loans in the mortgage securitization trusts without exceeding loss triggers  the levels of repurchases required to manage triggers may increase 
our ability to continue to manage triggers in our securitization trusts in the future is affected by our availability of cash from operations or through the sale of subordinated debt to fund these repurchases 
see risk factors delinquencies and prepayments in the pools of securitized loans could adversely affect the cash flow we receive from our interest only strips  impair our ability to sell or securitize loans in the future and impair our ability to repay the subordinated debt and negatively impact the value of our common stock 
additionally  our repurchase activity increases prepayments which may result in unfavorable prepayment experience

discounted cash flow analysis 
the estimation of the fair value of interest only strips is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis which estimates the present value of the future expected residual cash flows and overcollateralization cash flows utilizing assumptions made by management at the time loans are sold 
these assumptions include the rates used to calculate the present value of expected future residual cash flows and overcollateralization cash flows  referred to as the discount rates  prepayment rates and credit loss rates on the pool of loans 
these assumptions are monitored against actual experience and other economic and market conditions and are changed if deemed appropriate 
our methodology for determining the discount rates  prepayment rates and credit loss rates used to calculate the fair value of our interest only strips is described below 
discount rates 
we use discount rates  which we believe are commensurate with the risks involved in our securitization assets 
while quoted market prices on comparable interest only strips are not available  we have performed comparisons of our valuation assumptions and performance experience to others in the non conforming mortgage industry 
we quantify the risks in our securitization assets by comparing the asset quality and performance experience of the underlying securitized mortgage pools to comparable industry performance 
in determining the discount rate that we apply to residual cash flows  we follow what we believe to be the practice of other companies in the non conforming mortgage industry 
that is  to determine the discount rate by adding an interest rate spread to the all in cost of securitizations to account for the risks involved in securitization assets 
the all in cost of the securitization trusts investor certificates includes the highest trust certificate pass through interest rate in each mortgage securitization  trustee fees  and surety fees 
trustee fees and surety fees  where applicable  generally range from to basis points combined 
from industry experience comparisons and our evaluation of the risks inherent in our securitization assets  we have determined an interest rate spread  which is added to the all in cost of our mortgage loan securitization trusts investor certificates 
from june  through march   we had applied a discount rate of to residual cash flows 
on june   we reduced that discount rate to based on the following factors o we have experienced a period of sustained decreases in market interest rates 
interest rates on three and five year term us treasury securities have been on the decline since mid three year rates have declined approximately basis points and five year rates have declined approximately basis points 
o the interest rates on the bonds issued in our securitizations over this same timeframe also have experienced a sustained period of decline 
the highest trust certificate pass through interest rate has declined basis points  from in the securitization to in the securitization 
o the weighted average interest rate on loans securitized has declined from a high of in the securitization to in the securitization 
o market factors and the economy favor the continuation of low interest rates for the foreseeable future 
o economic analysis of interest rates and data currently being released support declining mortgage refinancings even though predicting the continuation of low interest rates for the foreseeable future 
o the interest rates paid on recently issued subordinated debt  which is used to fund our interest only strips  has declined from a high of in february to a current rate of in june however  because the discount rate is applied to projected cash flows  which consider expected prepayments and losses  the discount rate assumption was not evaluated in isolation 
these risks involved in our securitization assets were considered in establishing a discount rate 
the impact of this reduction in discount rate from to was to increase the valuation of our interest only strips by million at june  the discount rate that we apply to our residual cash flow portion of our interest only strips compared to rates used by others in the industry reflects our historically higher asset quality and performance of our securitized assets compared to industry asset quality and performance and the other characteristics of our securitized loans described below o underlying loan collateral with fixed interest rates  which are higher than others in the non conforming mortgage industry 
average interest rate of securitized loans exceeds the industry average by basis points or more 
all of the securitized loans have fixed interest rates  which are more predictable than adjustable rate loans 
o at origination  approximately to of securitized business purpose loans have prepayment fees and approximately to of securitized home equity loans have prepayment fees 
currently in our managed portfolio  approximately to of securitized business purpose loans have prepayment fees and approximately to of securitized home equity loans have prepayment fees 
our historical experience indicates that prepayment fees lengthen the prepayment ramp periods and slow annual prepayment speeds  which have the effect of increasing the life of the securitized loans 
o a portfolio mix of first and second mortgage loans of and  respectively 
historically  the high proportion of first mortgages has resulted in lower delinquencies and losses 
o a portfolio credit grade mix comprised of a credits  b credits  c credits  and d credits 
in addition  our historical loss experience is below what is experienced by others in the non conforming mortgage industry 
we apply a second discount rate to projected cash flows from the overcollateralization portion of our interest only strips 
the discount rate applied to projected overcollateralization cash flows in each mortgage securitization is based on the highest trust certificate pass through interest rate in the mortgage securitization 
in fiscal  we instituted the use of a minimum discount rate of on overcollateralization cash flows 
at june  we reduced the minimum discount rate to to reflect the sustained decline in interest rates 
this reduction in the minimum discount rate impacted the valuation of three securitizations and increased the june  valuation of our interest only strips by million 
at june   the average discount rate applied to projected overcollateralization cash flows was 
this discount rate is lower than the discount rate applied to residual cash flows because the risk characteristics of the projected overcollateralization cash flows do not include prepayment risk and have minimal credit risk 
for example  if the entire unpaid principal balance in a securitized pool of loans was prepaid by borrowers  we would fully recover the overcollateralization portion of the interest only strips 
in addition  historically  these overcollateralization balances have not been impacted by credit losses as the residual cash flow portion of our interest only strips has always been sufficient to absorb credit losses and stepdowns of overcollateralization have generally occurred as scheduled 
overcollateralization represents our investment in the excess of the aggregate principal balance of loans in a securitized pool over the aggregate principal balance of trust certificates 
the blended discount rate used to value the interest only strips  including the overcollateralization cash flows  was at june  prepayment rates 
the assumptions we use to estimate future prepayment rates are regularly compared to actual prepayment experience of the individual securitization pools of mortgage loans and an average of the actual experience of other similar pools of mortgage loans at the same number of months after their inception 
it is our practice to use an average historical prepayment rate of similar pools for the expected constant prepayment rate assumption while a pool of mortgage loans is less than a year old even though actual experience may be different 
during this period  before a pool of mortgage loans reaches its expected constant prepayment rate  actual experience both quantitatively and qualitatively is generally not sufficient to conclude that final actual experience for an individual pool of mortgage loans would be materially different from the average 
for pools of mortgage loans greater than one year old  prepayment experience trends for an individual pool is considered to be more significant 
for these pools  adjustments to prepayment assumptions may be made to more closely conform the assumptions to actual experience if the variance from average experience is significant and is expected to continue 
current economic conditions  current interest rates and other factors are also considered in our analysis 
as was previously discussed  for the past seven quarters  our actual prepayment experience was generally higher  most significantly on home equity loans  than our historical averages for prepayments 
see off balance sheet arrangements securitizations for further detail of our recent prepayment experience 
in addition to the use of prepayment fees on our loans  we have implemented programs and strategies in an attempt to reduce loan prepayments in the future 
these programs and strategies may include providing information to a borrower regarding costs and benefits of refinancing  which at times may demonstrate a refinancing option is not in the best economic interest of the borrower 
other strategies include offering second mortgages to existing qualified borrowers or offering financial incentives to qualified borrowers to deter prepayment of their loan 
we cannot predict with certainty what the impact these efforts will have on our future prepayment experience 
credit loss rates 
credit loss rates are analyzed in a similar manner to prepayment rates 
credit loss assumptions are compared to actual loss experience averages for similar mortgage loan pools and for individual mortgage loan pools 
delinquency trends and economic conditions are also considered 
if our analysis indicates that loss experience may be different from our assumptions  we would adjust our assumptions as necessary 
floating interest rate certificates 
some of the securitization trusts have issued floating interest rate certificates supported by fixed interest rate mortgages 
the fair value of the excess cash flow we will receive may be affected by any changes in the interest rates paid on the floating interest rate certificates 
the interest rates paid on the floating interest rate certificates are based on one month libor 
the assumption used to estimate the fair value of the excess cash flows received from these securitization trusts is based on a forward yield curve 
see interest rate risk management strategies for use of derivative financial instruments for further detail of our management of the risk of changes in interest rates paid on floating interest rate certificates 
sensitivity analysis 
the table below outlines the sensitivity of the current fair value of our interest only strips and servicing rights to and adverse changes in the key assumptions used in determining the fair value of those assets 
our base prepayment  loss and discount rates are described in the table summary of material mortgage loan securitization valuation assumptions and actual experience 
dollars in thousands securitized collateral balance  balance sheet carrying value of retained interests a  weighted average collateral life in years a amount includes interest only strips and servicing rights 
sensitivity of assumptions used to determine the fair value of retained interests dollars in thousands impact of adverse change change change prepayment speed   credit loss rate   floating interest rate certificates a  discount rate   a the floating interest rate certificates are indexed to one month libor plus a trust specific interest rate spread 
the base one month libor assumption used in this sensitivity analysis was derived from a forward yield curve incorporating the effect of rate caps where applicable to the individual deals 
the sensitivity analysis in the table above is hypothetical and should be used with caution 
as the figures indicate  changes in fair value based on a or variation in management s assumptions generally cannot easily be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in the assumptions to the change in fair value may not be linear 
also  in this table  the effect that a change in a particular assumption may have on the fair value is calculated without changing any other assumption 
changes in one assumption may result in changes in other assumptions  which might magnify or counteract the impact of the intended change 
these sensitivities reflect the approximate amount of the fair values that our interest only strips and servicing rights would be reduced for the indicated adverse changes 
these reductions would result in a charge to expense in the income statement in the period incurred and a resulting reduction of stockholders equity  net of income taxes 
the effect on our liquidity of changes in the fair values of our interest only strips and servicing rights are discussed in liquidity and capital resources

c current experience is a six month historical average 
d amounts represent weighted average percentages for four securitization pools  two securitization pools and two securitization pools 
na not applicable servicing rights 
as the holder of servicing rights on securitized loans  we are entitled to receive annual contractual servicing fees of basis points basis points in the case of the securitization on the aggregate outstanding loan balance 
these fees are paid out of accumulated mortgage loan payments before payments of principal and interest are made to trust certificate holders 
in addition  ancillary fees such as prepayment fees  late charges  nonsufficient fund fees and other fees are retained directly by us  as servicer  as payments are collected from the borrowers 
we also retain the interest paid on funds held in a trust s collection account until these funds are distributed from a trust 
the fair value of servicing rights is determined by computing the benefits of servicing in excess of adequate compensation  which would be required by a substitute servicer 
the benefits of servicing are the present value of projected net cash flows from contractual servicing fees and ancillary servicing fees 
these projections incorporate assumptions  including prepayment rates  credit loss rates and discount rates 
these assumptions are similar to those used to value the interest only strips retained in a securitization 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate capitalized servicing rights for impairment  which is measured as the excess of unamortized cost over fair value 
see securitizations for a discussion of the million write down of servicing rights recorded in fiscal from june to march  the discount rate applied in determining the fair value of servicing rights was which is basis points lower than the discount rate applied to value residual cash flows from interest only strips during that period 
on june   we reduced the discount rate on servicing rights cash flows to 
in determining the discount rate applied to calculate the present value of cash flows from servicing rights  management has subtracted a factor from the discount rate used to value residual cash flows from interest only strips to provide for the lower risks inherent in servicing assets 
unlike the interest only strips  the servicing asset is not exposed to credit losses 
additionally  the distribution of the contractual servicing fee cash flow from the securitization trusts is senior to both the trusts investor certificates and our interest only strips 
this priority of cash flow reduces the risks associated with servicing rights and thereby supports a lower discount rate than the rate applied to residual cash flows from interest only strips 
cash flows related to ancillary servicing fees  such as prepayment fees  late fees  and non sufficient fund fees are retained directly by us 
the impact of this reduction in discount rate from to was to increase the valuation of our servicing rights by million at june  this favorable impact was offset by a decrease of million mainly due to prepayment experience in fiscal servicing rights can be terminated under certain circumstances  such as our failure to make required servicer payments  defined changes of control and reaching specified loss levels on underlying mortgage pools 
the origination of a high percentage of loans with prepayment fees impacts our servicing rights and income in two ways 
prepayment fees reduce the likelihood of a borrower prepaying their loan 
this results in prolonging the length of time a loan is outstanding  which increases the contractual servicing fees to be collected over the life of the loan 
additionally  the terms of our servicing agreements with the securitization trusts allow us to retain prepayment fees collected from borrowers as part of our compensation for servicing loans 
in addition  although prepayments increased in recent periods compared to our historical averages  we have generally found that the non conforming mortgage market is less sensitive to prepayments due to changes in interest rates than the conforming mortgage market where borrowers have more favorable credit history for the following reasons 
first  there are relatively few lenders willing to supply credit to non conforming borrowers which limits those borrowers opportunities to refinance 
second  interest rates available to non conforming borrowers tend to adjust much slower than conforming mortgage interest rates which reduces the non conforming borrowers opportunity to capture economic value from refinancing 
as a result of the use of prepayment fees and the reduced sensitivity to interest rate changes in the non conforming mortgage market  we believe the prepayment experience on our managed portfolio is more stable than the mortgage market in general 
we believe this stability has favorably impacted our ability to value the future cash flows from our servicing rights and interest only strips because it increased the predictability of future cash flows 
however  for the past six quarters  our prepayment experience has exceeded our expectations for prepayments on our managed portfolio and as a result we have written down the value of our securitization assets 
see off balance sheet arrangements securitizations for further detail of the effects prepayments that were above our expectations have had on the value of our securitization assets 
whole loan sales we also sell loans with servicing released  which we refer to as whole loan sales 
gains on whole loan sales equal the difference between the net proceeds from such sales and the net carrying value of the loans 
the net carrying value of a loan is equal to its principal balance plus its unamortized origination costs and fees 
see off balance sheet arrangements securitizations for information on the volume of whole loan sales and premiums recorded for fiscal years ended june   and loans reported as sold on a whole loan basis were generally loans that we originated specifically for a whole loan sale and exclude impaired loans  which may be liquidated by selling the loan with servicing released

due to less favorable response for our business purpose loans in the whole loan sale market  pursuant to our business strategy  we plan to continue to originate business purpose loans  but at lower volumes to meet demand in the whole loan sale and securitization markets

as a result of these efforts  as well as the favorable environment for originating home equity loans due to low interest rates  american business mortgage services  inc home equity loan originations for the fiscal year ended june  increased by million  or  over the prior year period 
in addition  the historically low interest rate environment and productivity gains in our upland mortgage branch operations have resulted in an increase in loan originations of million  or  over the prior year period

gain on sale of loans securitizations 
for the year ended june   gains of million were recorded on the securitization of billion of loans 
this was a decrease of million  or over gains of million recorded on securitizations of billion of loans for the year ended june  the decrease in gains recorded was a direct result of our inability to complete a quarterly securitization during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 
see recent developments 
during the year ended june   securitization gains as a percentage of loans securitized on our term securitization deals increased to on loans securitized from on loans securitized for the year ended june  securitization gains as a percentage of loans securitized through our off balance sheet facility  however  decreased to for the year ended june  from for the year ended june  at june   the likelihood that the facility sponsor would ultimately transfer the underlying mortgage loans to a term securitization was significantly reduced and the amount of gain recognized for loans sold to this facility in the fourth quarter of fiscal was based on terms expected in a whole loan sale transaction 
our ability to sell loans into this facility expired pursuant to its terms on july  see off balance sheet arrangements securitizations for further discussion of this facility 
during fiscal  we saw increases in interest rate spreads on our three permanent securitizations that increased residual cash flows to us and the amount of cash we received at the closing of a securitization from notional bonds or premiums on the sale of trust certificates 
increases in the cash received at the closing of a securitization and residual cash flows resulted in increases in the gains we recognized on the sale of loans into securitizations as compared to the year ended june  see off balance sheet arrangements securitizations for further detail of how securitization gains are calculated 
the increase in interest rate spread realized in term securitization transactions during the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  resulted from decreases in pass through interest rates on investor certificates issued by securitization trusts 
for loans securitized during the year ended june   the weighted average loan interest rate was  a basis point decrease from the weighted average interest rate of on loans securitized during the year ended june  however  the weighted average interest rate on trust certificates issued in mortgage loan securitizations during the year ended june  was  a basis point decrease from during the year ended june  the resulting net improvement in interest rate spread was approximately basis points 
the improvement in the interest rate spread through fiscal to the third quarter of fiscal enabled us to enter into securitization transactions structured to provide cash at the closing of our term securitizations through the sale of notional bonds  sometimes referred to as interest only bonds  or the sale of trust certificates at a premium to total loan collateral 
during the year ended june  we received additional cash at the closing of our three securitizations  due to these modified structures  of million compared to million received for four securitizations for fiscal securitization gains and cash received at the closing of securitizations were partially offset by initial overcollateralization requirements of million in fiscal there was no initial overcollateralization requirement in fiscal the office of thrift supervision has adopted a rule effective in july  which precludes us and other non bank  non thrift creditors from using the parity act to preempt state prepayment penalty and late fee laws and regulations on new loan originations 
under the provisions of this rule we are required to modify or eliminate the practice of charging a prepayment fee and other fees in some of the states where we originate loans 
this new rule will potentially reduce the gain on sale recorded in new securitizations in two ways 
first  because the percentage of loans with prepayment fees will be reduced  the prepayment rates on securitized loan pools may increase and therefore the value of our interest only strips will decrease due to the shorter average life of the securitized loan pool 
second  the value of our servicing rights retained in a securitization may decrease due to a reduction in our ability to charge certain fees 
we are continuing to evaluate the impact of the adoption of this rule on our future lending activities and results of operations

gains on whole loan sales decreased million  to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  the volume of whole loan sales decreased  to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  the decrease in the volume of whole loan sales for the year ended june  resulted from management s decision to securitize additional loans as the securitization market s experience during the past year was more favorable than the whole loan sale market 
however  our inability to complete a securitization in the fourth quarter of fiscal created a need for short term liquidity which resulted in management utilizing whole loan sales to sell our fourth quarter of fiscal loan originations 
see recent developments and liquidity and capital resources for further detail 
interest and fees 
for the year ended june   interest and fee income increased million  or  to million compared to million in the same period of fiscal interest and fee income consists primarily of interest income earned on loans available for sale  interest income on invested cash and other ancillary fees collected in connection with loan and lease originations 
during the year ended june   total interest income increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended june  loan interest income increased million from june  as a result of our carrying a higher average loan balance during fiscal as compared to fiscal this increase was offset by a decrease of million of investment interest income due to lower interest rates earned on invested cash balances caused by general decreases in market interest rates 
other fees decreased million for fiscal compared to the same periods in fiscal the decrease was mainly due to a decrease in leasing income  which resulted from our decision in fiscal to discontinue the origination of new leases 
our ability to collect certain fees on loans we originate in the future may be impacted by proposed laws and regulations by various authorities 
interest accretion on interest only strips 
interest accretion of million was earned in the year ended june  compared to million in the year ended june  the increase reflects the growth in the balance of our interest only strips of million  or  to million at june  from million at june  in addition  cash flows from interest only strips for the year ended june  totaled million  an increase of million  or  from the year ended june  due to the larger size of our more recent securitizations and additional securitizations reaching final target overcollateralization levels and stepdown overcollateralization levels 
servicing income 
servicing income is comprised of contractual and ancillary fees collected on securitized loans serviced for others  less amortization of the servicing rights assets that are recorded at the time loans are securitized 
ancillary fees include prepayment fees  late fees and other servicing fee compensation 
for the year ended june   servicing income decreased million  or  to million from million for the year ended june  because loan prepayment levels in fiscal increased from fiscal  the amortization of servicing rights has also increased 
amortization is recognized in proportion to contractual and ancillary fees collected 
therefore the collection of additional prepayment fees in fiscal has resulted in higher levels of amortization 
the following table summarizes the components of servicing income for the years ended june   and in thousands year ended june  contractual and ancillary fees    amortization of servicing rights    total expenses 
total expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  as described in more detail below  this increase was mainly a result of increases in securitization asset valuation adjustments recorded during the year ended june   increases in employee related costs and increases in general and administrative expenses 
interest expense 
during fiscal  interest expense decreased million  or  to million compared to million for fiscal average subordinated debt outstanding during the year ended june  was million compared to million during the year ended june  average interest rates paid on subordinated debt outstanding decreased to during the year ended june  from during the year ended june  rates offered on subordinated debt were reduced beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal and have continued downward through the fourth quarter of fiscal in response to decreases in market interest rates as well as declining cash needs during that period 
the average interest rate of subordinated debt issued at its peak rate  which was the month of february  was compared to the average interest rate of subordinated debt issued in the month of june of 
we expect the average interest rate paid on subordinated debt to remain near current levels provided that market rates do not significantly increase 
the average outstanding balances under warehouse lines of credit were million during the year ended june   compared to million during the year ended june  the increase in the average balance on warehouse lines was due to a higher volume of loans originated and lower average cash balances available for loan funding during the period 
interest rates paid on warehouse lines are generally based on one month libor plus an interest rate spread ranging from to 
one month libor has decreased from approximately at june  to at june  provision for credit losses 
the provision for credit losses on loans and leases available for sale increased million  or  to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  a related allowance for loan losses on repurchased loans is included in our provision for credit losses in the period of repurchase 
see off balance sheet arrangements securitizations and off balance sheet arrangements trigger management for further discussion of repurchases from securitization trusts 
non accrual loans were million at june   compared to million at june  see managed portfolio quality for further detail 
the allowance for credit losses was million  or of loans and leases available for sale at june  compared to million  or of loans and leases available for sale at june  the allowance for credit losses as a percentage of gross receivables decreased from june  due to the decrease of the non accrual loan balance being carried on our balance sheet at june  as well as an increase in the balance of loans available for sale 
although we maintain an allowance for credit losses at the level we consider adequate to provide for potential losses  there can be no assurances that actual losses will not exceed the estimated amounts or that an additional provision will not be required  particularly if economic conditions deteriorate

for the year ended june   employee related costs increased million  or  to million from million in the prior year 
the increase in employee related costs for the year ended june  was primarily attributable to additions of personnel to originate  service and collect loans 
total employees at june  were  compared to  at june  since june   we reduced our workforce by employees 
with our business strategy s focus on whole loan sales and offering a broader mortgage product line that we expect will appeal to a wider array of customers  we currently require a smaller employee base with fewer sales  servicing and support positions 
these workforce reductions represent more than a decrease in staffing levels 
increases in payroll and benefits expenses for the increased number of employees were offset by reductions of management bonus accruals due to the overall financial performance of the company in fiscal the remaining increase was attributable to annual salary increases as well as increases in the costs of providing insurance benefits to employees during fiscal sales and marketing expenses 
for the year ended june   sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended june  the increase was primarily due to increases in expenses for direct mail advertising and broker commissions for home equity and business loan originations partially offset by decreases in newspaper advertisements for subordinated debt 
we expect to be able to streamline our sales and marketing costs in the future by offering a wider array of loan products and targeting segments that we believe will enable us to increase our loan origination conversion rates 
by increasing our conversion rates  we expect to be able to lower our overall sales and marketing costs per dollar originated 
see business strategy for further discussion 
general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended june   general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended june  this increase was primarily attributable to increases of approximately million in costs associated with servicing and collecting our larger total managed portfolio including expenses associated with reo and delinquent loans  million increase in costs associated with customer retention incentives and an increase of million in net losses on interest rate swaps 
securitization assets valuation adjustment 
during fiscal  write downs through the statement of income of million were recorded compared to million for fiscal of these adjustments  million and million were write downs of our interest only strips in fiscal and  respectively 
the remaining million in fiscal was a write down of our servicing rights 
these adjustments primarily reflect the impact of higher prepayment experience on home equity loans than anticipated during the periods 
the valuation adjustment recorded on securitization assets in fiscal was reduced by a million favorable valuation impact to the income statement as a result of reducing the discount rates applied in valuing the securitization assets at june  the discount rates were reduced at june  primarily to reflect the impact of the sustained decline in market interest rates 
the discount rate on the projected residual cash flows from our interest only strips was reduced from to at june  the discount rate used to determine the fair value of the overcollateralization portion of the cash flows from our interest only strips was minimally impacted by the decline in interest rates and remained at on average 
as a result  the blended rate used to value our interest only strips  including the overcollateralization cash flows  was at june  the discount rate on our servicing rights was reduced from to at june  the adjustments were considered to be other than temporary and were therefore recorded as an adjustment to earnings in the current period in accordance with sfas no 
and eitf as they relate to interest only strips and sfas no 
as it relates to servicing rights 
see off balance sheet arrangements securitizations for further detail of these adjustments 
provision for income tax expense benefit 
for fiscal  the provision for income taxes decreased million as a result of a million decline in pre tax income and a reduction in our effective tax rate from to 
the change in the effective tax rate was made due to an anticipated decrease in our overall tax liabilities 
the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards is not dependent on future taxable income from operations  but on the reversal of timing differences principally related to existing securitization assets 
these timing differences are expected to absorb the available net operating loss carryforwards during the carryforward period 
year ended june  compared to year ended june  total revenues 
for fiscal  total revenues increased million  or  to million from million for fiscal growth in total revenue was mainly the result of increases in gains on the securitization of mortgage loans and increases in interest accretion earned on our interest only strips 
gain on sale of loans securitizations 
for the year ended june   gains of million were recorded on the securitization of billion of loans 
this represents an increase of million  or  over gains of million recorded on securitizations of billion of loans for the year ended june  the increase in securitization gains for the year ended june  was due to both an increase in interest rate spreads earned in our securitizations and an increase in the volume of loans securitized 
the securitization gain as a percentage of loans securitized increased to for the year ended june  from on loans securitized for the year ended june  increases in interest rate spreads increase expected residual cash flows to us and result in increases in the gains we recognize on the sale of loans into securitizations 
see off balance sheet arrangements securitizations for further detail of how securitization gains are calculated 
the increase in interest rate spread for the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  resulted from decreases in pass through interest rates on investor certificates issued by securitization trusts 
for loans securitized during the year ended june   the average loan interest rate was  a decrease from on loans securitized during the year ended june  however  the average interest rate on trust certificates issued in mortgage loan securitizations during the year ended june  was  a decrease from during the year ended june  the resulting net improvement in interest rate spread was approximately basis points 
also contributing to the increase in the securitization gain percentages for the year ended june   was the increase in the amount of cash received at the closing of our securitizations 
the improvement in the interest rate spread this fiscal year enabled us to enter into securitization transactions structured to provide additional cash at the closing of the securitization through the sale of trust certificates to investors at a premium  or through the sale of notional bonds  sometimes referred to as interest only bonds 
during the year ended june  we received additional cash at the closing of our securitizations  due to these modified structures  of million compared to million in fiscal securitization gains and cash received at the closing of securitizations were reduced by hedging losses of million in fiscal  compared to losses of million in fiscal gain on sale of loans whole loan sales 
gains on whole loan sales decreased million  to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  the volume of whole loan sales decreased  to million for the year ended june  from million for the year ended june  the decrease in the volume of whole loan sales for the year ended june  resulted from management s decision to securitize additional loans in the favorable securitization market experienced during the year 
interest and fees 
for the year ended june   interest and fee income decreased million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended june  interest and fee income consists primarily of interest income earned on available for sale loans and other ancillary fees collected in connection with loans and leases 
during the year ended june   interest income decreased million  or  to million from million for the year ended june  this decrease was due to a lower weighted average interest rate on loans available for sale from the prior fiscal year and lower interest rates earned on invested cash balances due to general decreases in market interest rates 
this decrease was partially offset by the effect of a modification of the terms of our securitizations beginning in the second quarter of fiscal  which allowed us to retain interest income we had accrued up until the point of the sale 
prior to the second quarter of fiscal  all accrued interest income was retained by the securitization trust when collected 
other fees decreased million for the year ended june  from the prior year mainly due to the decrease in fees collected in connection with our leasing portfolio 
our leasing portfolio has decreased due to our decision in fiscal to discontinue the origination of new leases 
the ability to collect certain fees on loans we originate in the future may be impacted by proposed laws and regulations by various authorities 
see business regulation for more information regarding how our practices related to fees could be affected 
interest accretion on interest only strips 
interest accretion of million was earned in the year ended june  compared to million in the year ended june  the increase reflects the growth in the balance of our interest only strips of million  or  to million at june  from million at june  in addition  cash flows from interest only strips for the year ended june  totaled million  an increase of million  or  from fiscal due to the larger size of our more recent securitizations and additional securitizations reaching final target overcollateralization levels and step down overcollateralization levels 
servicing income 
for the year ended june   servicing income decreased million  or  to million from million for the year ended june  this decrease was attributable to an increase in prepayment fee collections resulting from higher prepayment rates  which caused an increase in servicing rights amortization 
total expenses 
total expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  as described in more detail below  this increase was mainly a result of a million interest only strips valuation adjustment recorded during the year ended june   increased interest expense attributable to the issuance of additional subordinated debt  increases in employee related costs and increases in general and administrative expenses 
interest expense 
during fiscal interest expense increased million  or  to million from million for fiscal the increase in interest expense was primarily due to an increase in the level of subordinated debt outstanding 
average subordinated debt outstanding during the year ended june  was million compared to million during the year ended june  the effect of the increase in outstanding debt was partially offset by a decrease in the average interest rates paid on subordinated debt 
average interest rates paid on subordinated debt outstanding decreased to during the year ended june  from during the year ended june  rates offered on subordinated debt were reduced beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal and continued downward in fiscal in response to decreases in market interest rates as well as our lower cash needs 
the average issuance rate of subordinated debt at its peak  which was the month of february  was compared to the average rate of subordinated debt issued in the month of june of 
the increase in interest expense for the year ended june  related to subordinated debt was partially offset by the impact of a decrease in the average outstanding balances under warehouse lines of credit and decreased interest rates paid on warehouse lines 
the average outstanding balances under warehouse lines of credit were million during the year ended june   compared to million during the year ended june  this decrease was due to the increased utilization of our available cash balances and proceeds from the sale of subordinated debt to fund loan originations and greater utilization of an off balance sheet mortgage conduit facility for the sale of loans 
interest rates paid on warehouse lines are generally based on one month libor plus an interest rate spread ranging from to 
one month libor decreased from approximately at june  to at june  provision for credit losses 
the provision for credit losses on loans and leases available for sale for the year ended june  increased million  or  to million  compared to million for the year ended june  the increase in the provision for credit losses was primarily due to increases in loans in non accrual status  which were generally repurchased from securitization trusts 
see off balance sheet arrangements trigger management for further discussion of repurchases from securitization trusts 
non accrual loans were million and million at june  and  respectively 
the allowance for credit losses was million  or of loans and leases available for sale at june  compared to million  or of loans and leases available for sale at june  this increase was due to an additional provision for delinquent and non accrual loans 
although we maintain an allowance for credit losses at the level we consider adequate to provide for potential losses  there can be no assurances that actual losses will not exceed the estimated amounts or that an additional provision will not be required

the increase was primarily attributable to additions of personnel primarily in the loan servicing and collections areas to service the larger managed portfolio 
total employees at june  were  compared to at june  the remaining increase was attributable to annual salary increases as well as increases in the costs of providing insurance benefits to employees 
sales and marketing expenses 
for the year ended june   sales and marketing expenses increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended june  expenses for direct mail advertising for loan originations and subordinated debt increased million and million  respectively  for the year ended june   compared to the prior fiscal year 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease of million in newspaper advertising 
general and administrative expenses 
for the year ended june   general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended june  this increase was primarily attributable to increases of approximately million in costs associated with servicing and collection of our larger total managed portfolio including expenses associated with reo and delinquent loans  in addition to increases of million in costs related to the issuance of our subordinated debt  million in depreciation expense and million in business insurance expense 
securitization assets valuation adjustment 
during fiscal  a write down through the statement of income of million was recorded on our interest only strips 
this adjustment reflects the impact of higher prepayment experience on home equity loans than anticipated during the period 
this portion of the impact of increased prepayments was considered to be other than temporary and was therefore recorded as an adjustment to earnings in the current period in accordance with sfas no

the receivable for sold loans of million at june  resulted from a whole loan sale transaction which closed on june   but settled in cash on july  total liabilities increased million  or  to billion from million at june  primarily due to increases in warehouse lines and other notes payable  subordinated debt outstanding  accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities 
the increase in warehouse lines and other notes payable was due to not completing a securitization in the fourth quarter of fiscal a fourth quarter securitization would have provided the cash to pay down the warehouse lines 
accounts payable and accrued expenses increased million  or  primarily due to accruals for costs associated with customer retention incentives to help mitigate loan prepayments and liabilities to our securitization trust collection accounts for periodic interest advances 
other liabilities increased million  or  to million from due to a million increase in the obligation for the repurchase of loans subject to removal of accounts provisions  recording an unearned rent incentive of million related to our corporate headquarters lease and a million recorded liability for unsettled interest rate swaps 
during fiscal  subordinated debt increased million  or  to million due to sales of subordinated debt used to repay existing debt  to fund loan originations and our operations and for general corporate purposes 
approximately million of the increase in subordinated debt was due to the reinvestment of accrued interest on the subordinated debt at maturity 
subordinated debt was times tangible equity at june   compared to times at june  see liquidity and capital resources for further information regarding outstanding debt 
deferred income taxes decreased million  or  to million at june  from million at june  this decrease is primarily due to a million net increase in expected benefits from net operating loss carryforwards  less a valuation allowance  and an million increase in other deferred tax debits 
the increase in other deferred tax debits primarily resulted from recognizing the benefit of governmental grants and lease incentives associated with the relocation of our corporate headquarters earlier for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes 
in addition  deferred tax payables on our interest only strips decreased by million due to loan prepayment experience

during fiscal subordinated debt increased million  or  to million due to sales of subordinated debt used to repay existing debt  to fund loan originations and our operations and for general corporate purposes including  but not limited to  repurchases of our outstanding common stock 
approximately million of the increase in subordinated debt was due to the reinvestment of accrued interest on the subordinated debt 
subordinated debt was times tangible equity at june   compared to times as of june  see liquidity and capital resources for further information regarding outstanding debt 
warehouse lines and other notes payable decreased million due to the lower balance of loan receivables held at june   and greater use of available cash to fund loans 
accrued interest payable increased million  or  to million from million at june  due to an increase in the level of subordinated debt outstanding partially offset by a decrease in average interest rates paid on debt 
deferred income taxes increased million  or  to million from million 
this increase was mainly due to higher levels of debt for tax securitization structures in the first and second quarters of fiscal as debt for tax transactions  the tax liability on securitization gains is deferred and becomes payable in future periods as cash is received from securitization trusts 
these structures created additional deferred tax credits of million which were partially offset by an increase in our federal tax loss carryforward receivable of million to a cumulative million 
in addition  miscellaneous deferred tax assets increased by million and miscellaneous deferred tax credits decreased by million resulting in a net increase of million 
the net operating loss carryforward will be utilized in future periods by structuring more securitization transactions as taxable transactions

deferment and forbearance arrangements 
from time to time  borrowers are confronted with events  usually involving hardship circumstances or temporary financial setbacks that adversely affect their ability to continue payments on their loan 
to assist borrowers  we may agree to enter into a deferment or forbearance arrangement 
prevailing economic conditions  which affect the borrower s ability to make their regular payments  may also have an impact on the value of the real estate or other collateral securing the loans  resulting in a change to the loan to value ratios 
we may take these conditions into account when we evaluate a borrower s request for assistance for relief from their financial hardship 
our policies and practices regarding deferment and forbearance arrangements  like all of our collections policies and practices  are designed to manage customer relationships  maximize collections and avoid foreclosure or repossession of other collateral  as applicable if reasonably possible 
we review and regularly revise these policies and procedures in order to enhance their effectiveness in achieving these goals 
we permit exceptions to the policies and practices from time to time based on individual borrowers situations 
in a deferment arrangement  we make advances to a securitization trust on behalf of the borrower in amounts equal to the delinquent loan payments  which include principal and interest 
additionally  we may pay taxes  insurance and other fees on behalf of the borrower 
based on our review of the borrower s current financial circumstances  the borrower must repay the advances and other payments and fees we make on the borrower s behalf either at the termination of the loan or on a monthly payment plan 
borrowers must provide a written explanation of their hardship  which generally requests relief from their loan payments 
we review the borrower s current financial situation and based upon this review  we may create a payment plan for the borrower which allows the borrower to pay past due amounts over a period from to months  but not beyond the maturity date of the loan  in addition to making regular monthly loan payments 
each deferment arrangement must be approved by two of our managers 
deferment arrangements which defer two or more past due payments must also be approved by a senior vice president 
principal guidelines currently applicable to the deferment process are i the borrower may have up to six payments deferred during the life of the loan  ii no more than three payments may be deferred during a twelve month period  and iii the borrower must have made a minimum of six payments on the loan and twelve months must have passed since the last deferment in order to qualify for a new deferment arrangement 
any deferment arrangement which includes an exception to our guidelines must be approved by the senior vice president of collections and an executive vice president 
if the deferment arrangement is approved  a collector contacts the borrower regarding the approval and the revised payment terms 
for borrowers who are two or more payments delinquent  we will consider using a forbearance arrangement if permitted under applicable state law 
in a forbearance arrangement  we make advances to a securitization trust on behalf of the borrower in amounts equal to the delinquent loan payments  which include principal and interest 
additionally  we may pay taxes  insurance and other fees on behalf of the borrower 
we assess the borrower s current financial situation and based upon this assessment  we may create a payment plan for the borrower which generally allows the borrower to pay past due amounts over a longer period than a typical deferment arrangement  but not beyond the maturity date of the loan 
we typically structure a forbearance arrangement to require the borrower to make payments of principal and interest equivalent to the original loan terms plus additional monthly payments  which in the aggregate represent the amount that we advanced to the securitization trust and other fees paid by us on behalf of the borrower 
we currently require the borrower to provide written documentation outlining their financial hardship  and we offer these arrangements to borrowers who we believe have the ability to remit post forbearance principal and interest payments in addition to the amounts advanced or paid by us 
as part of the written forbearance agreement  the borrower must execute a deed in lieu of foreclosure 
we retain the unrecorded deed until such time as the entire amount due under the forbearance agreement is repaid 
if the borrower subsequently defaults before repaying the amount due under the forbearance agreement in full and becomes days delinquent on principal and interest payments  we may elect to record the deed after providing proper notification to the borrower and a reasonable period of time to cure 
recording the deed in lieu of foreclosure gives us immediate legal title to the property without the need for further legal action 
principal guidelines currently applicable to the forbearance process are i the subject loan should be at least six months old  ii the loan should be a minimum of three payments delinquent  and iii each forbearance arrangement must be approved by a manager  the senior vice president of collections and the senior vice president of asset allocation 
forbearance arrangements which defer ten or more past due payments  involve advances or other payments of more than  or include an exception to our guidelines must also be approved by an executive vice president 
for delinquent borrowers with business purpose loans  we may enter into written forbearance agreements pursuant to which we do not obtain a deed in lieu of foreclosure 
these arrangements typically allow the borrower to pay past due amounts over a period of months  but not beyond the maturity date of the loan  and generally require the borrower to make a payment at the time of entering into the forbearance agreement 
we do not enter into a deferment or forbearance arrangement based solely on the fact that a loan meets the criteria for one of the arrangements 
our use of any of these arrangements depends upon one or more of the following factors our assessment of the individual borrower s current financial situation and reasons for the delinquency  a valuation of the real estate securing the loan and our view of prevailing economic conditions 
because deferment and forbearance arrangements are account management tools which help us to manage customer relationships  maximize collection opportunities and increase the value of our account relationships  the application of these tools generally is subject to constantly shifting complexities and variations in the marketplace 
we attempt to tailor the type and terms of the arrangement we use to the borrower s circumstances  and we prefer to use deferment over forbearance arrangements  if possible 
as a result of these arrangements  we reset the contractual status of a loan in our managed portfolio from delinquent to current based upon the borrower s resumption of making their loan payments 
generally  a loan remains current after a deferment or forbearance arrangement with the borrower only if the borrower makes the principal and interest as required under the terms of the original note exclusive of delinquent payments advanced or fees paid by us on the borrower s behalf as part of the deferment or forbearance arrangement  and we do not reflect it as a delinquent loan in our delinquency statistics 
however  if the borrower fails to make principal and interest payments  the account will generally be declared in default and collection actions resumed 
see regulation equal credit opportunity fair credit reporting and other laws and risk factors the inquiry regarding our forbearance practices by the us attorney could result in concerns regarding our loan servicing and limit our ability to sell or service our loans  sell subordinated debt  or obtain additional credit facilities  which would hinder our ability to operate profitably and repay our subordinated debt  which could negatively impact the value of our common stock 
the following table presents  as of the end of our last five quarters  information regarding loans under deferment and forbearance arrangements  which are reported as current loans if borrowers are current on principal and interest payments exclusive of delinquent payments advanced or fees paid by us on the borrower s behalf as part of the deferment or forbearance arrangement and thus not included in delinquencies in the delinquency table 
dollars in thousands cumulative unpaid principal balance of under under managed deferment forbearance total a portfolio june     september     december     march     june     a included in cumulative unpaid principal balance are loans with arrangements that were entered into longer than twelve months ago 
at june   there was million of cumulative unpaid principal balance under deferment arrangements and million of cumulative unpaid principal balance under forbearance arrangements that were entered into prior to july additionally  there are loans under deferment and forbearance arrangements which have returned to delinquent status 
at june  there was million of cumulative unpaid principal balance under deferment arrangements and million of cumulative unpaid principal balance under forbearance arrangements that are now reported as delinquent days or more 
during the final six months of fiscal  we experienced a pronounced increase in the number of borrowers under deferment arrangements and in light of the weakened economic environment we made use of deferment arrangements to a greater degree than in prior periods 
we currently expect this condition to be temporary and will attempt to actively manage the loan accounts under deferment arrangements to maximize our chances for full recovery of the borrowed amount while still accommodating borrower needs during their period of hardship 
the following table presents the amount of unpaid principal balance of loans that entered into a deferment or forbearance arrangement in each quarter of fiscal dollars in thousands unpaid principal balance impacted by arrangements of under under managed quarter ended deferment forbearance total portfolio september     december     march     june     delinquent loans and leases 
total delinquencies loans and leases with payments past due greater than days  excluding reo in the total managed portfolio were million at june  compared to million and million at june  and  respectively 
total delinquencies as a percentage of the total managed portfolio were at june  compared to and at june  and  respectively 
the increase in delinquencies and delinquency percentages in fiscal and were mainly due to the impact on our borrowers of continued uncertain economic conditions  which may include the reduction in other sources of credit to our borrowers and the seasoning of the managed portfolio 
these factors have resulted in a significant increase in the usage of deferment and forbearance activities 
in addition  the delinquency percentage has increased due to increased prepayment rates resulting from refinancing activities 
refinancing is not typically available to delinquent borrowers  and therefore the remaining portfolio is experiencing a higher delinquency rate 
a decrease in the growth rate for the origination of new loans also contributed to the increase in the delinquency percentage in fiscal and from as the managed portfolio continues to season  and if our economy continues to lag or worsen  the delinquency rate may continue to increase 
delinquent loans and leases held as available for sale on our balance sheet decreased from million at june  to million at june  real estate owned 
total reo  comprising foreclosed properties and deeds acquired in lieu of foreclosure  decreased to million  or of the total managed portfolio at june  compared to million  or at june  and million  or at june  the decrease in the volume of reo was mainly due to a concerted effort by management to reduce the time a loan remains in seriously delinquent status until the sale of an reo property 
the acceleration of the foreclosure process had caused a substantial increase in the balance of properties classified as reo during fiscal and fiscal we have implemented processes to decrease the cycle time in the disposition of reo properties 
part of this strategy includes bulk sales of reo properties as evidenced by the leveling of reo as a percentage of the managed portfolio 
reducing the time properties are carried reduces carrying costs for interest on funding the cost of the property  legal fees  taxes  insurance and maintenance related to these properties 
as our portfolio seasons and if our economy continues to lag or worsen  the reo balance may increase 
reo held by us on our balance sheet increased from million at june  to million at june  primarily due to repurchases of foreclosed loans from our mortgage securitization trusts 
loss experience 
during the year ended june   we experienced net loan and lease charge offs in the total managed portfolio of million or on an annualized basis 
during the year ended june   we experienced net loan and lease charge offs in the total managed portfolio of million  or of the total managed portfolio 
during fiscal  we experienced net loan and lease charge offs in the total managed portfolio of million  or of the average total managed portfolio 
principal loss severity experience on delinquent loans generally has ranged from to of principal and loss severity experience on reo generally has ranged from to of principal 
the increase in net charge offs from the prior periods were due to a larger volume of loans that became delinquent  and or  were liquidated during the period as well as economic conditions and the seasoning of the managed portfolio 
as noted above  we have attempted to reduce the time a loan remains in seriously delinquent status until the sale of an reo property in order to reduce carrying costs on the property 
the increase in the charge off percentage was partially offset by reductions in our carrying costs due to the acceleration of the timing of the disposition of reo

real estate values have generally experienced an increase in recent periods and their increases have exceeded the rate of increase of many other types of investments in the current economy 
if in the future this trend reverses and real estate values begin to decline our loss severity could increase 
see risk factors a decline in value of the collateral securing our loans could result in an increase in losses on foreclosure  which could hinder our ability to attain profitable operations  limit our ability to repay our subordinated debt and negatively impact the value of our common stock for further detail of the effect that declining real estate values could have on our business 
interest rate risk management a primary market risk exposure that we face is interest rate risk 
profitability and financial performance is sensitive to changes in interest rate swap yields  one month libor yields and the interest rate spread between the effective rate of interest received on loans available for sale or securitized all fixed interest rates and the interest rates paid pursuant to credit facilities or the pass through interest rate to investors for interests issued in connection with securitizations 
profitability and financial performance is also sensitive to the impact of changes in interest rates on the fair value of loans which are expected to be sold in whole loan sales 
a substantial and sustained increase in market interest rates could adversely affect our ability to originate and purchase loans and maintain our profitability 
the overall objective of our interest rate risk management strategy is to mitigate the effects of changing interest rates on profitability and the fair value of interest rate sensitive balances primarily loans available for sale  interest only strips  servicing rights and subordinated debt 
we would address this challenge by carefully monitoring our product pricing  the actions of our competition and market trends and the use of hedging strategies in order to continue to originate loans in as profitable a manner as possible 
a component of our interest rate risk exposure relates to changes in the fair value of certain interest only strips due to changes in one month libor 
the structure of certain securitization trusts includes a floating interest rate certificate  which pays interest based on one month libor plus an interest rate spread 
floating interest rate certificates in a securitization expose us to gains or losses due to changes in the fair value of the interest only strip from changes in the floating interest rate paid to the certificate holders 
a rising interest rate environment could unfavorably impact our liquidity and capital resources 
rising interest rates could impact our short term liquidity by limiting our ability to sell loans at favorable premiums in whole loan sales  widening investor interest rate spread requirements in pricing future securitizations  increasing the levels of overcollateralization in future securitizations  limiting our access to borrowings in the capital markets and limiting our ability to sell our subordinated debt securities at favorable interest rates 
in a rising interest rate environment  short term and long term liquidity could also be impacted by increased interest costs on all sources of borrowed funds  including the subordinated debt  and by reducing interest rate spreads on our securitized loans  which would reduce our cash flows 
see liquidity and capital resources for a discussion of both long term and short term liquidity 
interest rate sensitivity 
the following table provides information about financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for interest only strips and servicing rights  the table presents projected principal cash flows utilizing assumptions including prepayment and credit loss rates 
see off balance sheet arrangements securitizations for more information on these assumptions 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related average interest rates by expected maturity dates dollars in thousands amount maturing after june  months months months months months there fair to to to to to after total value rate sensitive assets loans and leases available for sale a

loans available for sale 
gain on sale of loans may be unfavorably impacted to the extent we hold loans with fixed interest rates prior to their sale 
see business strategy for a discussion of our intent to add adjustable rate mortgage loans to our loan product line 
a significant variable affecting the gain on sale of loans in a securitization is the interest rate spread between the average interest rate on fixed interest rate loans and the weighted average pass through interest rate to investors for interests issued in connection with the securitization 
although the average loan interest rate is fixed at the time the loan is originated  the pass through interest rate to investors is not fixed until the pricing of the securitization which occurs just prior to the sale of the loans 
generally  the period between loan origination and pricing of the pass through interest rate is less than three months 
if market interest rates required by investors increase prior to securitization of the loans  the interest rate spread between the average interest rate on the loans and the pass through interest rate to investors may be reduced or eliminated 
this factor could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition 
we estimate that each reduction in the interest rate spread reduces the gain on sale of loans as a percentage of loans securitized by approximately 
see strategies for use of derivative financial instruments for further detail of our interest rate risk management for available for sale loans 
a significant variable affecting the gain on sale of fixed interest rate loans sold in whole loan sale transactions is the change in market interest rates between the date the loan was originated at a fixed rate of interest and the date the loan was sold in a whole loan sale 
if market interest rates required by investors increase prior to sale of the loans  the premium expected on sale of the loans would be reduced 
this factor could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition 
interest only strips and servicing rights 
a portion of the certificates issued to investors by certain securitization trusts are floating interest rate certificates based on one month libor plus an interest rate spread 
the fair value of the excess cash flow we will receive from these trusts would be affected by any changes in interest rates paid on the floating interest rate certificates 
at june   million of debt issued by loan securitization trusts was floating interest rate certificates based on one month libor  representing of total debt issued by loan securitization trusts 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  the changes in fair value are generally recognized as part of net adjustments to other comprehensive income  which is a component of retained earnings 
as of june   the interest rate sensitivity for million of floating interest rate certificates issued by securitization trusts is managed with an interest rate swap contract effectively fixing our cost for this debt 
see strategies for use of derivative financial instruments for further detail 
in addition  the interest rate sensitivity for million of floating interest rate certificates issued from the trust is managed by an interest rate cap which was entered into by the trust at the inception of the securitization 
this interest rate cap limits the one month libor to a maximum rate of and was structured to automatically unwind as the floating interest rate certificates pay down 
a significant change in market interest rates could increase or decrease the level of loan prepayments  thereby changing the size of the total managed loan portfolio and the related projected cash flows 
we attempt to minimize prepayment risk on interest only strips and servicing rights by requiring prepayment fees on business loans and home equity loans  where permitted by law 
when originally recorded  approximately of business loans and of home equity loans in the total managed portfolio were subject to prepayment fees 
currently  approximately of business loans and of home equity loans in the total managed portfolio are subject to prepayment fees 
however  higher than anticipated rates of loan prepayments could result in a write down of the fair value of related interest only strips and servicing rights  adversely impacting earnings during the period of adjustment 
we perform revaluations of our interest only strips and servicing rights on a quarterly basis 
as part of the revaluation process  we monitor the assumptions used for prepayment rates against actual experience  economic conditions and other factors and we adjust the assumptions  if warranted 
see off balance sheet arrangements securitizations for further information regarding these assumptions and the impact of prepayments during this period 
subordinated debt 
we also experience interest rate risk to the extent that as of june  approximately million of our liabilities were comprised of fixed interest rate subordinated debt with scheduled maturities of greater than one year 
to the extent that market interest rates demanded on subordinated debt increase in the future  the interest rates paid on replacement debt could exceed interest rates currently paid thereby increasing interest expense and reducing net income 
strategies for use of derivative financial instruments 
all derivative financial instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with realized and unrealized gains and losses included in the statement of income in the period incurred 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts collectively referred to as derivatives  and for hedging activities 
it requires that an entity recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
if certain criteria are met  a derivative may be specifically designated as a a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment fair value hedge  b a hedge of the exposure to variable cash flows of a forecasted transaction cash flow hedge  or c a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation 
if a derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge designation  changes in the fair value of a derivative are either offset against the change in the fair value of assets  liabilities  or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value will be recognized in earnings immediately 
sfas no 
was effective on a prospective basis for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
on july  resulted in the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of thousand pre tax being recognized as expense in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended june  due to the immateriality of the cumulative effect of adopting sfas no 
 the thousand pre tax expense is included in general and administrative expense in the consolidated statement of income 
the tax effects and earnings per share amounts related to the cumulative effect of adopting sfas no 
are not material 
hedging activity from time to time  we utilize derivative financial instruments in an attempt to mitigate the effect of changes in interest rates between the date loans are originated at fixed interest rates and the date the fixed interest rate pass through certificates to be issued by a securitization trust are priced or the date the terms and pricing for a whole loan sale are fixed 
generally  the period between loan origination and pricing of the pass through interest rate or whole loan sale is less than three months 
derivative financial instruments we use for hedging changes in fair value due to interest rate changes may include interest rate swaps  futures and forward contracts 
the nature and quantity of hedging transactions are determined based on various factors  including market conditions and the expected volume of mortgage loan originations and purchases 
the unrealized gain or loss derived from these derivative financial instruments  which are designated as fair value hedges  is reported in earnings as it occurs with an offsetting adjustment to the fair value of the item hedged 
the fair value of derivative financial instruments is based on quoted market prices 
the fair value of the items hedged is based on current pricing of these assets in a securitization or whole loan sale 
cash flow related to hedging activities is reported as it occurs 
the effectiveness of our hedge relationships is continuously monitored 
if highly effective correlation did not exist  the related gain or loss on the hedged item would no longer be recognized as an adjustment to income 
related to loans expected to be sold through securitizations 
at the time the derivative contracts are executed  they are specifically designated as hedges of mortgage loans or our residual interests in mortgage loans in our mortgage conduit facility  which we would expect to be included in a term securitization at a future date 
the mortgage loans and mortgage loans underlying residual interests in mortgage pools consist of essentially similar pools of fixed interest rate loans  collateralized by real estate primarily residential real estate with similar maturities and similar credit characteristics 
fixed interest rate pass through certificates issued by securitization trusts are generally priced to yield an interest rate spread above interest rate swap yield curves with maturities matching the maturities of the pass through certificates 
we may hedge potential interest rate changes in interest rate swap yield curves with forward starting interest rate swaps  eurodollar futures  forward treasury sales or derivative contracts of similar underlying securities 
this practice has provided strong correlation between our hedge contracts and the ultimate pricing we will receive on the subsequent securitization 
related to loans expected to be sold through whole loan sale transactions 
we may also utilize derivative financial instruments in an attempt to mitigate the effect of changes in market interest rates between the date loans are originated at fixed interest rates and the date that the loans will be sold in a whole loan sale 
at the time the derivative contracts are executed  they are specifically designated as hedges of mortgage loans or our residual interests in mortgage loans in our mortgage conduit facility  which we would expect to be included in a whole loan sale transaction at a future date 
we may hedge the effect of changes in market interest rates with forward sale commitments  forward starting interest rate swaps  eurodollar futures  forward treasury sales or derivative contracts of similar underlying securities 
on june   we entered into a forward sale agreement providing for the sale of million of home equity mortgage loans at a price of 
disqualified hedging relationship 
the securitization market was not available to us in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result  we realized that the expected high correlation between the changes in the fair values of the derivative contracts and the mortgage loans would not be achieved and discontinued hedge accounting 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  million of losses on million notional amount of forward starting interest rate swaps previously designated as a hedge of mortgage loans expected to be securitized was charged to earnings 
an offsetting increase of million in the value of the hedged mortgage loans was recorded in earnings  representing the changes in value of the loans until the date that we learned that the securitization market was not available 
we recorded the following gains and losses on the fair value of derivative financial instruments accounted for as hedging transactions or on disqualified hedging relationships for the years ended june   and ineffectiveness related to qualified hedging relationships during the period was immaterial 
ineffectiveness is a measure of the difference in the change in fair value of the derivative financial instrument as compared to the change in the fair value of the item hedged in thousands year ended june  offset by gains and losses recorded on securitizations losses on derivative financial instruments    offset by gains and losses recorded on the fair value of hedged items losses on derivative financial instruments  amount settled in cash paid    at june   forward sale agreements and outstanding forward starting interest rate swap contracts accounted for as hedges and unrealized losses recorded as liabilities on the balance sheet were as follows in thousands notional unrealized amount loss forward sale agreement  forward starting interest rate swaps  a a represents the liability carried on the balance sheet at june  for previously recorded losses not yet settled in cash 
there were no outstanding derivatives contracts accounted for as hedges at june  or trading activity generally  we do not enter into derivative financial instrument contracts for trading purposes 
however  we have entered into derivative financial instrument contracts which we have not designated as hedges in accordance with sfas no 
and were therefore accounted for as trading assets or liabilities 
related to loans expected to be sold through securitizations 
during fiscal  we used interest rate swap contracts to protect the future securitization spreads on loans in our pipeline 
loans in the pipeline represent loan applications for which we are in the process of obtaining all the documentation required for a loan approval or approved loans  which have not been accepted by the borrower and are not considered to be firm commitments 
we believed there was a greater chance that market interest rates we would obtain on the subsequent securitization of these loans would increase rather than decline  and chose to protect the spread we could earn in the event of rising rates 
however due to a decline in market interest rates during the period the derivative contracts were used to manage interest rate risk on loans in our pipeline  we recorded losses on forward starting interest rate swap contracts during the fiscal year ended june  the losses are summarized in the table below 
related to loans expected to be sold through whole loan sale transactions 
the million notional amount of forward starting interest rate swap contracts carrying over from the disqualified hedging relationship discussed above are currently being utilized to manage the effect of changes in market interest rates on the fair value of fixed rate mortgage loans that were previously expected to be sold in a fourth quarter securitization  but are now expected to be sold in whole loan sale transactions 
we have elected not to designate these derivative contracts as an accounting hedge 
we recorded the following gains and losses on the fair value of derivative financial instruments classified as trading for the year ended june  there were no derivative contracts classified as trading for the years ended june  and except those noted below to manage the exposure to changes in the fair value of certain interest only strips due to changes in one month libor 
in thousands trading gains losses on forward starting interest rate swaps related to loan pipeline  related to whole loan sales amount settled in cash paid  at june   outstanding forward starting interest rate swap contracts used to manage interest rate risk on loans expected to be sold in whole loan sale transactions and the associated unrealized gains recorded as assets on the balance sheet are summarized in the table below 
there were no open derivative contracts classified as trading for the years ended june  and except those noted below to manage the exposure to changes in the fair value of certain interest only strips due to changes in one month libor 
in thousands notional unrealized amount gain forward starting interest rate swaps  the sensitivity of the forward starting interest rate swap contracts held as trading as of june  to a change in market interest rates is million 
related to interest only strips 
for fiscal years ended june  and  respectively  we recorded net losses of million and million on an interest rate swap contract which is not designated as an accounting hedge 
this contract was designed to reduce the exposure to changes in the fair value of certain interest only strips due to changes in one month libor 
the loss on the swap contract was due to decreases in the interest rate swap yield curve during the periods the contract was in place 
included in the million net loss recorded in the fiscal year ended june   were unrealized gains of million representing the net change in the fair value of the contract during the fiscal year and million of cash losses paid during the fiscal year 
included in the million net loss recorded in the fiscal year ended june   were unrealized losses of million representing the net change in the fair value of the contract during the fiscal year and million of cash losses paid during the fiscal year 
the cumulative net unrealized loss of million is included as a trading liability in other liabilities 
terms of the interest rate swap contract at june  were as follows dollars in thousands notional amount  rate received floating a rate paid fixed maturity date april 
unrealized loss sensitivity to change in interest rates a rate represents the spot rate for one month libor paid on the securitized floating interest rate certificate at the end of the period 
derivative transactions are measured in terms of a notional amount  but this notional amount is not carried on the balance sheet 
the notional amount is not exchanged between counterparties to the derivative financial instrument  but is only used as a basis to determine fair value  which is recorded on the balance sheet and to determine interest and other payments between the counterparties 
our exposure to credit risk in a derivative transaction is represented by the fair value of those derivative financial instruments in a gain position 
we attempt to manage this exposure by limiting our derivative financial instruments to those traded on major exchanges and where our counterparties are major financial institutions 
at june   we held no derivative financial instruments in a cumulative gain position 
in the future  we may expand the types of derivative financial instruments we use to hedge interest rate risk to include other types of derivative contracts 
however  an effective interest rate risk management strategy is complex and no such strategy can completely insulate us from interest rate changes 
poorly designed strategies or improperly executed transactions may increase rather than mitigate risk 
hedging involves transaction and other costs that could increase as the period covered by the hedging protection increases 
although it is expected that such costs would be offset by income realized from securitizations in that period or in future periods  we may be prevented from effectively hedging fixed interest rate loans held for sale without reducing income in current or future periods 
in addition  while eurodollar rates  interest rate swap yield curves and the pass through interest rate of securitizations are generally strongly correlated  this correlation has not held in periods of financial market disruptions eg  the so called russian crisis in the later part of 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity and capital resource management is a process focused on providing the funding to meet our short and long term cash needs 
we have used a substantial portion of our funding sources to build our managed portfolio and investments in securitization residual assets with the expectation that they will generate sufficient cash flows in the future to cover our operating requirements  including repayment of maturing subordinated debt 
our cash needs change as the mix of loan sales through securitization shifts to whole loan sales  as the managed portfolio grows  as our interest only strips grow and release more cash  as subordinated debt matures  as operating expenses change and as revenues increase 
because we have historically experienced negative cash flows from operations  our business requires continual access to short and long term sources of debt to generate the cash required to fund our operations 
our cash requirements include funding loan originations and capital expenditures  repaying existing subordinated debt  paying interest expense and operating expenses  and in connection with our securitizations  funding overcollateralization requirements and servicer obligations 
at times  we have used cash to repurchase our common stock and could in the future use cash for unspecified acquisitions of related businesses or assets although no acquisitions are currently contemplated 
initially  we finance our loans under several secured and partially committed credit facilities 
these credit facilities are generally revolving lines of credit  which we have with several financial institutions that enable us to borrow on a short term basis against our loans 
we then securitize or sell our loans to unrelated third parties on a whole loan basis to generate the cash to pay off these revolving credit facilities 
in fiscal  we recorded a net loss of million 
the loss was due in part to our inability to complete our typical quarterly securitization of loans during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year 
also contributing to the loss was million of net pre tax charges for valuation adjustments compared to million of valuation adjustments in fiscal recorded on our securitization assets during the fiscal year 
see off balance sheet arrangements securitizations for more detail on the valuation adjustments 
our short term liquidity was negatively impacted by several recent events 
our inability to complete our typical publicly underwritten securitization during the fourth quarter of fiscal contributed to our loss for fiscal and adversely impacted our short term liquidity position 
in addition  further advances under a non committed portion of one of our credit facilities were subject to the discretion of the lender and subsequent to june   there were no new advances under the non committed portion 
additionally  on august   this credit facility was amended and  among other changes  the non committed portion was eliminated 
we also had a million mortgage conduit facility with a financial institution that enabled us to sell our loans into an off balance sheet facility  which expired pursuant to its terms on july  at june   of the million in revolving credit and conduit facilities available to us  million was drawn upon 
at september   of the million in revolving credit facilities available to us  million was drawn upon 
our revolving credit facilities and mortgage conduit facility had million of unused capacity available at june  and million of unused capacity at september   which significantly reduced our ability to fund future loan originations until we sell existing loans  extend or expand existing credit facilities  or add new credit facilities 
in addition  we have temporarily discontinued sales of new subordinated debt  which further impaired our liquidity 
as a result of these liquidity issues  since june   we substantially reduced our loan origination volume 
from july  through august   we originated million of loans  which represents a significant reduction as compared to originations of million of loans for the same period in fiscal our inability to originate loans at previous levels may adversely impact the relationships our subsidiaries have or are developing with their brokers and our ability to retain employees 
as a result of the decrease in loan originations and liquidity issues described above  we anticipate incurring a loss for the first quarter of fiscal the amount of the loss will depend  in part  upon our ability to complete a securitization prior to september  and  if completed  the size and terms of the securitization 
further  we can provide no assurances that we will be able to sell our loans  extend existing facilities or expand or add new credit facilities 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing  we may not be able to restructure our business to permit profitable operations or repay our subordinated debt when due 
even if we are able to obtain adequate financing  our inability to securitize our loans could hinder our ability to operate profitably in the future and repay our subordinated debt when due 
we undertook specific remedial actions to address short term liquidity concerns including entering into an agreement on june  with an investment bank to sell up to million of mortgage loans  subject to the satisfactory completion of the purchaser s due diligence review and other conditions  and soliciting bids and commitments from other participants in the whole loan sale market 
in total  from june  through september   we sold approximately million which includes million of loans sold by the expired mortgage conduit facility of loans through whole loan sales 
we are continuing the process of selling our loans 
we also suspended paying quarterly cash dividends on our common stock 
as a result of the loss experienced during fiscal  we were not in compliance with the terms of certain of the financial covenants under two of our principal credit facilities one for million and the other for million  of which million was non committed and we requested and obtained waivers of these requirements from our lenders 
see credit facilities 
the lender under the million warehouse credit facility has granted us a waiver for our non compliance with a financial covenant in that credit facility through september  this facility was amended to reduce the available credit to million and the financial covenants were replaced with new covenants with which we are currently in compliance 
we also entered into an amendment to the million credit facility which provides for the waiver of our non compliance with the financial covenants in that facility  the reduction of the committed portion of this facility from million to million  the elimination of the million non committed portion of this credit facility and the acceleration of the termination date of this facility from november to september  our ability to repay this facility upon termination is dependent on our ability to refinance the loans in one of our new facilities or our sale of loans currently warehoused in the terminating facility by september  in addition  if the anticipated loss for the first quarter of fiscal described above results in our non compliance with any financial covenants  we intend to seek the appropriate waivers 
there can be no assurances that we will obtain any of these waivers 
on september   we entered into definitive agreements with a financial institution for a new million credit facility for the purpose of funding our loan originations 
pursuant to the terms of this facility  we are required to  among other things i obtain a written commitment for another credit facility of at least million and close that additional facility by october  which condition would be satisfied by the closing of the million facility described below  ii have a net worth of at least million by september   with quarterly increases of million thereafter  iii apply of our net cash flow from operations each quarter to reduce the outstanding amount of subordinated debt commencing with the quarter ending march   and iv provide a parent company guaranty of of the outstanding principal amount of loans under the facility 
prior to the closing of the second facility  our borrowing capacity on this million credit facility is limited to million 
this facility has a term of months expiring in september and is secured by the mortgage loans which are funded by advances under the facility with interest equal to libor plus a margin 
this facility is subject to representations and warranties and covenants  which are customary for a facility of this type  as well as amortization events and events of default related to our financial condition 
these provisions require  among other things  our maintenance of a delinquency ratio for the managed portfolio at the end of each fiscal quarter of less than  our subordinated debt not to exceed million at any time  our ownership of an amount of repurchased loans not to exceed of the managed portfolio and our registration statement registering million of subordinated debt be declared effective by the sec no later than october  on september   we executed a commitment letter for a mortgage warehouse credit facility with a warehouse lender  which consists of a senior secured revolving credit facility of up to million to fund loan originations and a secured last out revolver facility up to million 
the commitment letter is subject to certain conditions  including  among other things i entering into definitive agreements  except as provided in the commitment letter  ii the absence of a material adverse change in the business  operations  property  condition financial or otherwise or prospects of us or our affiliates  and iii our receipt of another credit facility in an amount not less that million  subject to terms and conditions acceptable to this lender which condition is satisfied by the new million facility described above 
the commitment letter provides that these facilities will have a term of three years with an interest rate on amounts outstanding under the million portion of the credit facility equal to the greater of one month libor plus a margin or the difference between the yield maintenance fee as defined in the commitment letter and the one month libor plus a margin 
advances under this facility would be collateralized by substantially all of our present and future assets including pledged loans and a security interest in substantially all of our interest only strips and residual interests which will be contributed to a special purpose entity organized by us to facilitate this transaction 
we also agreed to pay fees of approximately million annually plus a nonusage fee based on the difference between the average daily outstanding balance for the current month and the maximum credit amount under the facility and the lender s out of pocket expenses 
we anticipate that these facilities will be subject to representations and warranties  events of default and covenants which are customary for facilities of this type  as well as our agreement to i maintain sales or renewals of our subordinated debt securities of million per month  ii restrict total principal and interest outstanding on our subordinated debt to million or less  iii make quarterly reductions commencing in april of an amount of subordinated debt outstanding to be determined  iv maintain maximum interest rates payable on subordinated debt securities not to exceed percentage points above comparable rates for fdic insured products  and v the lender s receipt of our audited financial statements for the period ended june  the definitive agreements will grant the lender an option at any time after the first anniversary of entering into the definitive agreements to increase the credit amount on the million facility to million with additional fees payable by us plus additional interest as may be required by the institutions or investors providing the lender with these additional funds 
the commitment letter requires that we enter into definitive agreements not later than october  while we anticipate that we will close this transaction prior to such date  we cannot assure you that these negotiations will result in definitive agreements or that such agreements  as negotiated  will be on terms and conditions acceptable to us 
in the event we are unable to close these facilities or another facility within the time frame provided under the new million credit facility described above  the lender on that facility would be under no obligation to make further advances under the terms of that facility and outstanding advances would have to be repaid over a period of time 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we explored a number of strategic alternatives to address these liquidity issues in the event we are unable to borrow under the new million credit facility  close the million credit facilities or obtain alternative financing 
in the event we were unable to obtain the additional credit facilities necessary to operate our business  we developed a contingent business plan described more fully under recent developments business strategy adjustments which contemplates  among other things  the sale of million principal amount of additional subordinated debt through march and the renewal of approximately of outstanding subordinated debt upon maturity 
we believe that this contingent business plan addresses our liquidity issues and may permit us to restructure our operations  if necessary  without the receipt of an expanded or additional credit facility 
there can be no assurance that our contingent business plan will be successful or that it will enable us to repay our subordinated debt when due 
the following discussion of liquidity and capital resources should be read in conjunction with the discussion contained in application of critical accounting policies 
when loans are sold through a securitization  we retain the rights to service the loans 
servicing loans obligates us to advance interest payments for delinquent loans under certain circumstances and allows us to repurchase a limited amount of delinquent loans from securitization trusts 
see off balance sheet arrangements  off balance sheet arrangements securitizations and off balance sheet arrangements trigger management for more information on how the servicing of securitized loans affects requirements on our capital resources and cash flow 
cash flow from operations  the issuance of subordinated debt and lines of credit fund our operating cash needs 
we expect these sources of funds to be sufficient to meet our cash needs 
loan originations are funded through borrowings against warehouse credit facilities and sales into an off balance sheet facility 
each funding source is described in more detail below 
cash flow from operations 
one of our corporate goals is to achieve positive cash flow from operations 
however  we cannot be certain that we will achieve our projections regarding declining negative cash flow or positive cash flow from operations 
the achievement of this goal is dependent on our ability to successfully implement our business strategy and on the following items o manage the mixture of whole loan sales and securitization transactions to maximize cash flow and economic value  o manage levels of securitizations to maximize cash flows received at closing and subsequently from interest only strips and servicing rights  o maintain a portfolio of mortgage loans which will generate income and cash flows through our servicing activities and the residual interests we hold in the securitized loans  o build on our established approaches to underwriting loans  servicing and collecting loans and managing credit risks in order to control delinquency and losses  o continue to identify and invest in technology and other efficiencies to reduce per unit costs in our loan origination and servicing process  and o control overall expense levels 
historically  our cash flow from operations has been negatively impacted by a number of factors 
the growth of our loan originations negatively impacts our cash flow from operations because we incur the cash expenses of the origination  but generally do not recover the cash outflow from these origination expenses until we securitize or sell the underlying loans 
with respect to loans securitized  we may be required to wait more than one year to begin recovering the cash outflow from loan origination expenses through cash inflows from our residual assets retained in securitization 
a second factor  which could negatively impact our cash flow  is an increase in market interest rates 
if market interest rates increase  the premiums we would be paid on whole loan sales could be reduced and the interest rates that investors will demand on the certificates issued in future securitizations will increase 
the increase in interest rates paid to investors reduces the cash we will receive from interest only strips created in future securitizations 
although we may have the ability in a rising interest rate market to charge higher loan interest rates to our borrowers  competition  laws and regulations and other factors may limit or delay our ability to do so 
cash flow from operations for the year ended june  was a negative million compared to negative million for fiscal negative cash flow from operations increased million for the year ended june  mainly due to our inability to complete a securitization in the fourth quarter of fiscal at june  we carried million of loans available for sale  compared to million at june  we also carried a receivable of million for the proceeds on loans sold in a whole loan sale transaction  which closed on june   but settled in cash on july  also contributing to the increase in negative cash flow for fiscal was an increase in the amount of delinquent loans repurchased from securitization trusts in order to avoid delinquency and loss triggers and the funding of million in initial overcollateralization from the proceeds of our december securitization and million on our fourth quarter of fiscal sales to a mortgage conduit facility 
increases in the cash flow from interest only strips in fiscal were offset by increases in operating expenses  mainly general and administrative expenses to service and collect the larger managed portfolio 
the amount of cash we receive and the amount of overcollateralization we are required to fund at the closing of our securitizations and the amount of cash we receive as gains on whole loan sales are dependent upon a number of factors including market factors over which we have no control 
although we expect negative cash flow from operations to continue and fluctuate in the foreseeable future  our goal is to reduce our negative cash flow from operations from historical levels 
we believe that if our projections based on our business strategy prove accurate  our cash flow from operations will become positive 
however  negative cash flow from operations in fiscal may continue due to the nature of our operations and the timing to implement our business strategy 
we generally expect the level of cash flow from operations to fluctuate 
as was previously discussed  during the seven quarters ended june   our actual prepayment experience on our managed portfolio was generally higher than our average historical levels for prepayments 
prepayments result in decreases in the size of our managed portfolio and decreases in the expected future cash flows to us from our interest only strips and servicing rights 
however  due to the favorable interest rate spreads  favorable initial overcollateralization requirements and levels of cash received at closing on our more recent securitizations we do not believe our recent increase in prepayment experience will have a significant impact on our aggregate expected cash flows from operations in the future 
other factors could negatively affect our cash flow and liquidity such as increases in mortgage interest rates  legislation or other economic conditions which may make our ability to originate loans more difficult 
as a result  our costs to originate loans could increase or our volume of loan originations could decrease

b amounts include principal and interest 
c amounts include lease for office space 
d amounts related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters 
the provisions of the lease  local and state grants will provide us with reimbursement of a substantial amount of these payments 
credit facilities 
borrowings against warehouse credit facilities represent cash advanced to us for a limited duration  generally no more than days  and are secured by the loans we pledge to the lender 
these credit facilities provide the primary funding source for loan originations 
the ultimate sale of the loans through securitization or whole loan sale generates the cash proceeds necessary to repay the borrowings under the warehouse facilities 
in addition  we have the availability of revolving credit facilities  which may be used to fund our operations 
these credit facilities are generally extended for a one year term before the renewal of the facility must be re approved by the lender 
we periodically review our expected future credit needs and negotiate credit commitments for those needs as well as excess capacity in order to allow us flexibility in the timing of the securitization of our loans

on september   we entered into definitive agreements with a financial institution for a new million credit facility for the purpose of funding our loan originations 
pursuant to the terms of this facility  we are required to  among other things i obtain a written commitment for another credit facility of at least million and close that additional facility by october  which condition would be satisfied by the closing of the million facility described below  ii have a net worth of at least million by september   with quarterly increases of million thereafter  iii apply of our net cash flow from operations each quarter to reduce the outstanding amount of subordinated debt commencing with the quarter ending march   and iv provide a parent company guaranty of of the outstanding principal amount of loans under the facility 
prior to the closing of the second facility  our borrowing capacity on this million credit facility is limited to million 
this facility has a term of months expiring in september and is secured by the mortgage loans which are funded by advances under the facility with interest equal to libor plus a margin 
this facility is subject to representations and warranties and covenants  which are customary for a facility of this type  as well as amortization events and events of default related to our financial condition 
these provisions require  among other things  our maintenance of a delinquency ratio for the managed portfolio at the end of each fiscal quarter of less than  our subordinated debt not to exceed million at any time  our ownership of an amount of repurchased loans not to exceed of the managed portfolio and our registration statement registering million of subordinated debt be declared effective by the sec no later than october  on september   we executed a commitment letter for a mortgage warehouse credit facility with a warehouse lender  which consists of a senior secured revolving credit facility of up to million to fund loan originations and a secured last out revolver facility up to million 
the commitment letter is subject to certain conditions  including  among other things i entering into definitive agreements  except as provided in the commitment letter  ii the absence of a material adverse change in the business  operations  property  condition financial or otherwise or prospects of us or our affiliates  and iii our receipt of another credit facility in an amount not less that million  subject to terms and conditions acceptable to this lender which condition is satisifed by the new million facility described above 
the commitment letter provides that these facilities will have a term of three years with an interest rate on amounts outstanding under the million portion of the credit facility equal to the greater of one month libor plus a margin or the difference between the yield maintenance fee as defined in the commitment letter and the one month libor plus a margin 
advances under this facility would be collateralized by substantially all of our present and future assets including pledged loans and a security interest in substantially all of our interest only strips and residual interests which will be contributed to a special purpose entity organized by us to facilitate this transaction 
we also agreed to pay fees of approximately million annually plus a nonusage fee based on the difference between the average daily outstanding balance for the current month and the maximum credit amount under the facility and the lender s out of pocket expenses 
we anticipate that these facilities will be subject to representations and warranties  events of default and covenants which are customary for facilities of this type  as well as our agreement to i maintain sales or renewals of our subordinated debt securities of million per month  ii restrict total principal and interest outstanding on our subordinated debt to million or less  iii make quarterly reductions commencing in april of an amount of subordinated debt outstanding to be determined  iv maintain maximum interest rates payable on subordinated debt securities not to exceed percentage points above comparable rates for fdic insured products  and v the lender s receipt of our audited financial statements for the period ended june  the definitive agreements will grant the lender an option at any time after the first anniversary of entering into the definitive agreements to increase the credit amount on the million facility to million with additional fees payable by us plus additional interest as may be required by the institutions or investors providing the lender with these additional funds 
the commitment letter requires that we enter into the definitive agreements not later than october  while we anticipate that we will close this transaction prior to such date  we cannot assure you that these negotiations will result in definitive agreements or that such agreements  as negotiated  will be on terms and conditions acceptable to us 
in the event we are unable to close these facilities or another facility within the time frame provided under the new million credit facility described above  the lender on that facility would be under no obligation to make further advances under the terms of that facility and outstanding advances would have to be repaid over a period of time 
the warehouse credit agreements require that we maintain specific financial covenants regarding net worth  leverage  net income  liquidity  total debt and other standards 
each agreement has multiple individualized financial covenant thresholds and ratio of limits that we must meet as a condition to drawing on a particular line of credit 
as a result of the loss experienced during fiscal  we were not in compliance with the terms of certain of the financial covenants related to net worth  consolidated stockholders equity and the ratio of total liabilities to consolidated stockholders equity under two of our principal credit facilities one for million and the other for million  of which million was non committed 
pursuant to the terms of these credit facilities  the failure to comply with the financial covenants constitutes an event of default and at the option of the lender  entitles the lender to  among other things  terminate commitments to make future advances to us  declare all or a portion of the loan due and payable  foreclose on the collateral securing the loan  require servicing payments be made to the lender or other third party or assume the servicing of the loans securing the credit facility 
an event of default under these credit facilities would result in defaults pursuant to cross default provisions of our other agreements  including but not limited to  other loan agreements  lease agreements and other agreements 
the failure to comply with the terms of these credit facilities or to obtain the necessary waivers would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources 
we have requested and obtained waivers from these covenant provisions from both lenders 
the lender under the million warehouse credit facility has granted us a waiver for our non compliance with a financial covenant in that credit facility through september  this facility was amended to reduce the available credit to million and the financial covenants were replaced with new covenants 
we also entered into an amendment to the million credit facility which provides for the waiver of our non compliance with the financial covenants in that facility  the reduction of the committed portion of this facility from million to million  the elimination of the million non committed portion of this credit facility and the acceleration of the termination date of this facility from november to september  our ability to repay this facility upon termination is dependent on our ability to refinance the loans in one of our new facilities or our sale of loans currently warehoused in the terminating facility by september  in addition  if the anticipated loss for the first quarter of fiscal described above results in our non compliance with any financial covenants  we intend to seek the appropriate waivers 
there can be no assurances that we will obtain any of these waivers 
some of our financial covenants in other credit facilities have minimal flexibility and we cannot say with certainty that we will continue to comply with the terms of all debt covenants 
there can be no assurance as to whether or in what form a waiver or modification of these agreements would be granted us 
subordinated debt securities 
the issuance of subordinated debt funds the majority of our remaining operating cash requirements 
we rely significantly on our ability to issue subordinated debt since our cash flow from operations is not sufficient to meet these requirements 
in order to expand our businesses we have issued subordinated debt to partially fund growth and to partially fund maturities of subordinated debt 
in addition  at times we may elect to utilize proceeds from the issuance of subordinated debt to fund loans instead of using our warehouse credit facilities  depending on our determination of liquidity needs 
during fiscal  subordinated debt increased by million  net of redemptions compared to an increase of million in fiscal the reduction in the level of subordinated debt sold was a result of our focus on becoming cash flow positive and reducing our reliance on subordinated debt 
we registered million of subordinated debt under a registration statement  which was declared effective by the sec on october  of the million  million of this debt was unsold as of june  in june  we filed a new registration statement with the sec to register an additional million of subordinated debt 
we intend to meet our obligation to repay such debt and interest as it matures with cash flow from operations  cash flows from interest only strips and cash generated from additional debt financing 
the utilization of funds for the repayment of such obligations should not adversely affect operations 
our unrestricted cash balances are sufficient to cover approximately of the million of subordinated debt and accrued interest maturities due within one year 
unrestricted cash balances were million at june   compared to million at june  the current low interest rate environment has provided an opportunity to reduce the interest rates offered on our subordinated debt 
the weighted average interest rate of our subordinated debt issued in the month of june was  compared to debt issued in june  which had a weighted average interest rate of 
debt issued at our peak rate  which was in february  was at a rate of 
our ability to further decrease the rates offered on subordinated debt  or maintain the current rates  depends on market interest rates and competitive factors among other circumstances 
the weighted average remaining maturity of our subordinated debt at june was months compared to months at june sales into special purpose entities and off balance sheet facilities 
we rely significantly on access to the asset backed securities market through securitizations to provide permanent funding of our loan production 
we also retain the right to service the loans 
residual cash from the loans after required principal and interest payments are made to the investors provides us with cash flows from our interest only strips 
it is our expectation that future cash flows from our interest only strips and servicing rights will generate more of the cash flows required to meet maturities of our subordinated debt and our operating cash needs 
see off balance sheet arrangements for further detail of our securitization activity and effect of securitizations on our liquidity and capital resources 
other liquidity considerations 
in december  our shareholders approved an amendment to our certificate of incorporation to increase the number of shares of authorized preferred stock from million shares to million shares 
the preferred shares may be used to raise equity capital  redeem outstanding debt or acquire other companies  although no such acquisitions are currently contemplated 
the board of directors has discretion with respect to designating and establishing the terms of each series of preferred stock prior to issuance 
a further decline in economic conditions  continued instability in financial markets or further acts of terrorism in the united states may cause disruption in our business and operations including reductions in demand for our loan products and our subordinated debt securities  increases in delinquencies and credit losses in our managed loan portfolio  changes in historical prepayment patterns and declines in real estate collateral values 
to the extent the united states experiences an economic downturn  unusual economic patterns and unprecedented behaviors in financial markets  these developments may affect our ability to originate loans at profitable interest rates  to price future loan securitizations profitably and to hedge our loan portfolio effectively against market interest rate changes which could cause reduced profitability 
should these disruptions and unusual activities occur  our profitability and cash flow could be reduced and our ability to make principal and interest payments on our subordinated debt could be impaired 
additionally  under the soldiers and sailors civil relief act of  members of all branches of the military on active duty  including draftees and reservists in military service and state national guard called to federal duty are entitled to have interest rates reduced and capped at per annum  on obligations including mortgage loans incurred prior to the commencement of military service for the duration of military service and may be entitled to other forms of relief from mortgage obligations 
to date  compliance with the act has not had a material effect on our business 
related party transactions we have a loan receivable from our chairman and chief executive officer  anthony j 
santilli  for million  which was an advance for the exercise of stock options to purchase  shares of our common stock in the loan is due in september earlier if the stock is disposed of 
interest at is payable annually 
the loan is secured by  shares of our common stock  and is shown as a reduction of stockholders equity in our financial statements 
on april   we awarded  shares  shares after the effect of stock dividends of our common stock to richard kaufman  our director  as a result of services rendered in connection with our stock repurchases 
in february  we awarded  shares of our common stock to each of warren e 
palitz and jeffrey s 
steinberg  as newly appointed members of our board of directors 
we employ members of the immediate family of two of our directors and executive officers in various executive and other positions 
we believe that the salaries we pay these individuals are competitive with salaries paid to other employees in similar positions in our organization and in our industry 
in fiscal  lanard axilbund  inc  a real estate brokerage and management firm in which our director  mr 
sussman  was a partner and is now chairman emeritus  acted as our agent in connection with the lease of our new corporate office space 
as a result of this transaction  lanard axilbund  inc has received commissions from the landlord of the new corporate office space 
we believe the amount of this commission is consistent with market and industry standards 
additionally  as part of our agreement with lanard axilbund  inc  they have reimbursed us for some of our costs related to finding new office space including some of our expenses related to legal services  feasibility studies and space design 
additionally  we have business relationships with other related parties  including family members of two of our directors and executive officers  through which we have  from time to time  purchased appraisal services  office equipment and real estate advisory services 
none of our related party transactions  individually or collectively  are material to our results of operations 
reconciliation of non gaap financial measures this document contains non gaap financial measures 
for purposes of the sec s regulation g  a non gaap financial measure is a numerical measure of a registrant s historical or future financial performance  financial position or cash flow that excludes amounts  or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts  that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap in our statement of income  balance sheet or statement of cash flows or equivalent statement  or includes amounts  or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts  that are excluded from the most directly comparable measure so calculated and presented 
in this regard  gaap refers to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
pursuant to the requirements of regulation g  following is a reconciliation of the non gaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measure 
we present certain financial ratios to measure balance sheet leverage relationships that include or exclude items from gaap based financial ratios consistent with common industry practices 
additionally  some ratios are adjusted in order to isolate secured items such as secured debt or overcollateralization  which is secured by loan principal in securitization trusts  from unsecured items 
management believes these measures enhance the users overall understanding of our current financial performance and prospects for the future and that these measures help in understanding the risk characteristics of certain significant balance sheet amounts and how their proportions to equity change over time 
the following tables reconcile the ratios presented in balance sheet information balance sheet data to gaap basis measures dollars in thousands june  total liabilities to tangible equity total liabilities    equity    less goodwill    tangible equity    total liabilities to tangible equity x x x liabilities equity x x x adjusted debt to tangible equity total liabilities    less cash    less warehouse lines    less loans in process    equity    less goodwill    tangible equity    adjusted debt to tangible equity x x x liabilities equity x x x subordinated debt to tangible june  equity subordinated debt    equity    less goodwill    tangible equity    subordinated debt to tangible equity x x x liabilities equity x x x interest only strips to adjusted tangible equity interest only strips    less overcollateralization    equity    less goodwill    tangible equity    plus subordinated debt with remaining maturity years    interest only strips to adjusted tangible equity x x x interest only strips equity x x x we present managed portfolio and managed real estate owned  referred to as reo  information 
management believes these measures enhance the users overall understanding of our current financial performance and prospects for the future because the volume and credit characteristics of off balance sheet securitized loan and lease receivables have a significant effect on our financial performance as a result of our retained interests in the securitized loans 
retained interests include interest only strips and servicing rights 
in addition  because the servicing and collection of our off balance sheet securitized loan and lease receivables are performed in the same manner and according to the same standards as the servicing and collection of our on balance sheet loan and lease receivables  certain of our resources  such as personnel and technology  are allocated based on their pro rata relationship to the total managed portfolio and total managed reo

our corporate headquarters was located in bala cynwyd  pennsylvania prior to july  the lease for the bala cynwyd facility has expired 
the current lease term for the philadelphia facility expires in june the terms of the rental agreement require increased payments annually for the term of the lease with average minimum annual rental payments of million 
we have entered into contracts  or may engage parties in the future  related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters such as contracts for building improvements to the leased space  office furniture and equipment and moving services 
the provisions of the lease and local and state grants will provide us with reimbursement of a substantial amount of our costs related to the relocation  subject to certain conditions and limitations 
we do not believe our unreimbursed expenses or unreimbursed cash outlay related to the relocation will be material to our operations 
the lease requires us to maintain a letter of credit in favor of the landlord to secure our obligations to the landlord throughout the term of the lease 
the amount of the letter of credit is million and declines over time to million 
the letter of credit is currently issued by jpmorgan chase bank under our million facility with jpmorgan chase bank

we also lease the office space in roseland  new jersey and the nine year lease expires in january the terms of the rental agreement require increased payments periodically for the term of the lease with average minimum annual rental payments of million

recent accounting pronouncements the following description should be read in conjunction with the significant accounting policies  which have been adopted and are set forth in note of the june  consolidated financial statements 
in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued financial interpretation no 
fin guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin standardizes practices related to the recognition of a liability for the fair value of a guarantor s obligation 
the rule requires companies to record a liability for the fair value of its guarantee to provide or stand ready to provide services  cash or other assets 
the rule applies to contracts that require a guarantor to make payments based on an underlying factor such as change in market value of an asset  collection of the scheduled contractual cash flows from individual financial assets held by a special purpose entity  non performance of a third party  for indemnification agreements  or for guarantees of the indebtedness of others among other things 
the provisions of fin are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees that are issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements were effective for statements of annual or interim periods ending after december  based on the requirements of this guidance for the year ended june   we have recorded a million liability in conjunction with the sale of mortgage loans to the abfs securitization trust which occurred in march this liability represents the fair value of periodic interest advances that we  as servicer of the securitized loans  are obligated to pay on behalf of delinquent loans in the trust 
the recording of this liability reduces the gain on sale recorded for the securitization 
we would expect to record a similar liability for any subsequent securitization as it occurs 
the amount of the liability that will be recorded is dependent mainly on the volume of loans we securitize  the expected performance of those loans and the interest rate of the loans 
in the year ended june   the adoption of fin reduced net income by approximately million and diluted earnings per share by 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for further detail of this obligation 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation and requires pro forma disclosures of the effect on net income and earnings per share had the fair value method been used to be included in annual and interim reports and disclosure of the effect of the transition method used if the accounting method was changed  among other things 
sfas no 
is effective for annual reports of fiscal years beginning after december  and interim reports for periods beginning after december  we plan to continue using the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock based compensation and therefore the new rule will have no effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we have adopted the new standard related to disclosure in the interim period beginning january  see notes and of the consolidated financial statements for further detail of the adoption of this rule 
in april  the fasb began reconsidering the current alternatives available for accounting for stock based compensation 
currently  the fasb is continuing its deliberations on this matter 
we cannot predict whether the guidance will change our current accounting for stock based compensation  or what effect  if any  changes may have on our current financial condition or results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued fin consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin provides guidance on the identification of variable interest entities that are subject to consolidation requirements by a business enterprise 
a variable interest entity subject to consolidation requirements is an entity that does not have sufficient equity at risk to finance its operations without additional support from third parties and the equity investors in the entity lack certain characteristics of a controlling financial interest as defined in the guidance 
spes are one type of entity  which under certain circumstances may qualify as a variable interest entity 
although we use unconsolidated spes extensively in our loan securitization activities  the guidance will not affect our current consolidation policies for spes as the guidance does not change the guidance incorporated in sfas no 
accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities which precludes consolidation of a qualifying spe by a transferor of assets to that spe 
fin will therefore have no effect on our financial condition or results of operations and would not be expected to affect it in the future 
in march  the fasb announced that it is reconsidering the permitted activities of a qualifying spe 
we cannot predict whether the guidance will change or what effect  if any  changes may have on our current consolidation policies for spes 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities to clarify the financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
is intended to improve financial reporting by requiring comparable accounting methods for similar contracts 
sfas no 
is effective for contracts entered into or modified subsequent to june  the requirements of sfas no 
do not affect our current accounting for derivative instruments or hedging activities  therefore  it will have no effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
requires an issuer to classify certain financial instruments having characteristics of both liabilities and equity  such as mandatorily redeemable shares and obligations to repurchase the issuer s equity shares  as liabilities 
the guidance is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified subsequent to may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period after june  we do not have any instruments with such characteristics and do not expect sfas no 
to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations
