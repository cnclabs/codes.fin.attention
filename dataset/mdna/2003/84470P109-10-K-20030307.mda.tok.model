critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of the company and its subsidiaries conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and general practices within the financial services industry 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company considers its critical accounting policies to include the following allowance for losses on loans 
the allowance for losses on loans represents management s best estimate of probable losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio 
the allowance for losses on loans is increased by the provision for losses on loans charged to expense and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
the provision for losses on loans is determined based on management s assessment of several factors reviews and evaluations of specific loans  changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  current and anticipated economic conditions and the related impact on specific borrowers and industry groups  historical loan loss experience  the level of classified and nonperforming loans and the results of regulatory examinations 
loans are considered impaired if  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the measurement of impaired loans is generally based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the historical effective interest rate stipulated in the loan agreement  except that all collateral dependent loans are measured for impairment based on fair value of the collateral 
in measuring the fair value of the collateral  management uses assumptions eg discount rates and methodologies eg comparison to the recent selling price of similar assets consistent with those that would be utilized by unrelated third parties 
changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers  in economic conditions  in historical loss experience and in the conditions of the various markets in which collateral may be sold may all affect the required level of the allowance for losses on loans and the associated provision for loan losses 
estimation of fair value 
the estimation of fair value is significant to a number of the company s assets  including available for sale investment securities and other real estate owned 
these are all recorded at either fair value or at the lower of cost or fair value 
furthermore  accounting principles generally accepted in the united sates require disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments as a part of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
fair values are volatile and may be influenced by a number of factors  including market interest rates  prepayment speeds  discount rates and the shape of yield curves 
fair values for most available for sale investment securities are based on quoted market prices  where available 
if quoted market prices are not available  fair values are based on the quoted prices of similar instruments 
the fair values of other real estate owned are typically determined based on appraisals by third parties  less estimated costs to sell

forward looking information certain statements of other than historical fact that are contained in this document and in written material  press releases and oral statements issued by or on behalf of the company may be considered to be forward looking statements as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of these statements may include words such as expect  estimate  project  anticipate  should  intend  probability  risk  target  objective and similar expressions 
forward looking statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties and the company s actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
for example  certain market risk disclosures are dependent on choices about key model characteristics and assumptions and are subject to various limitations 
see item business and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
by their nature  certain of the market risk disclosures are only estimates and could be materially different from what actually occurs in the future 
as a result  actual income gains and losses could materially differ from those that have been estimated 
other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward looking statements include  but are not limited to general economic conditions  either nationally or in the state of texas  legislation or regulatory changes which adversely affect the businesses in which the company is engaged  changes in the interest rate environment which reduce interest margins  significant increases in competition in the banking and financial services industry  changes in consumer spending  and bankruptcy rates borrowing and saving habits  technological changes  the company s ability to increase market share and control expenses  the effect of compliance with legislation or regulatory changes  the effect of changes in accounting policies and practices and the costs and effects of unanticipated litigation 
financial condition total assets increased million or to billion at december  from billion at december  the increase was primarily attributable to a million increase in net loans and a million increase in the securities portfolio 
at december   net loans were million compared to million at december  the securities portfolio totaled million at december  compared to million at december  the increase in loans and securities was funded primarily by increases in deposits and fhlb dallas advances 
nonperforming assets at december  totaled million  representing of total assets  compared to million or of total assets at december  nonaccruing loans increased to million and the ratio of nonaccruing loans to total loans increased to at december  as compared to  and at december  other real estate owned increased to  at december  from  at december  loans days past due at december  decreased to  compared to  at december  restructured loans at december  increased to  compared to  at december  deposits increased million to million at december  from million at december  fhlb dallas advances were million at december   a million increase from million at december  short term fhlb dallas advances increased million to million at december  from million at december  long term fhlb dallas advances decreased million to million at december  from million at december  other borrowings at december  and totaled million and million  respectively  and at december  consisted of million of short term borrowings  million of long term junior subordinated convertible debentures and million of long term junior subordinated debentures 
on november   the company through its wholly owned subsidiary  southside capital trust ii the trust ii issuer  sold  cumulative convertible preferred securities the junior subordinated convertible debentures at a liquidation amount of per convertible preferred security for an aggregate amount of  these securities have a convertible feature that allows the owner to convert each security to a share of the company s common stock at a conversion price of per common share 
these securities have a distribution rate of per annum payable at the end of each calendar quarter 
on may   the company through its wholly owned subsidiary  southside capital trust the trust issuer  sold  preferred securities the junior subordinated debentures at a liquidation amount of per preferred security for an aggregate amount of  these securities have a distribution rate of per annum payable at the end of each calendar quarter 
shareholders equity at december  totaled million compared to million at december  the increase primarily reflects the net income recorded for the year ended december   an increase in the accumulated other comprehensive income of million and common stock issued of million as a result of conversions from the company s junior subordinated convertible debentures into the company s common stock  the company s incentive stock option and dividend reinvestment plans 
these increases were partially offset by the repurchase of  shares of the outstanding stock at an average price of per share and the payment of cash dividends 
during the economy in the bank s market area has shown some signs of slowing 
the two areas of concern are the slow growth of the national economy and the personal bankruptcy rate 
management expects these trends to have some effect on the company s net charge offs 
management of the company  however  cannot predict whether current economic conditions will improve  remain the same or decline 
leverage strategy in may the company implemented a leverage strategy designed to enhance its profitability with acceptable levels of credit  interest rate and liquidity risk 
the leverage strategy consists of borrowing long and short term funds from the fhlb dallas and investing the funds primarily in premium mortgage backed securities  and to a lesser extent  long term municipal securities 
although premium mortgage backed securities often carry lower yields than traditional mortgage loans and other types of loans the company makes  these securities generally increase the overall quality of the company s assets by virtue of the securities underlying insurance or guarantees  are more liquid than individual loans and may be used to collateralize the company s borrowings or other obligations 
in addition  in low interest rate environments the amortization expense for premium mortgage backed securities is associated with substantially higher prepayments experienced and reduces the overall yields of the premium mortgage backed securities portfolio 
while the strategy of investing a substantial portion of the company s assets in premium mortgage backed and municipal securities has resulted in lower interest rate spreads and margins  the company believes that the lower operating expenses and reduced credit risk combined with the managed interest rate risk of this strategy have enhanced its overall profitability 
at this time  the company does not maintain the leverage strategy for any other reason than to enhance overall profitability 
one of the risks associated with the asset structure the company maintains is a lower net interest rate spread and margin when compared to peers 
this asset structure  spread and margin increases the need to monitor the company s interest rate risk 
the company will attempt to adopt a balance sheet strategy going forward to gradually reduce the securities portfolio as a percentage of earning assets assuming quality loan growth is available in the company s market area 
on the liability side  the company will attempt to gradually reduce fhlb dallas borrowings as a percentage of total deposits assuming deposits can be retained or acquired at a lower overall cost 
the intended net result is to increase the company s net interest spread 
the leverage strategy is dynamic and requires ongoing management 
as interest rates  funding costs and security spreads change  the company s determination of the proper securities to own and funding to obtain must be re evaluated 
management has attempted to design the leverage strategy so that in a rising interest rate environment the interest income earned on the premium mortgage backed securities may increase to help offset the increase in funding costs 
as interest rates decrease  the interest income on the premium mortgage backed securities may decrease due to increased prepayments on these securities as funding costs decrease 
due to the unpredictable nature of mortgage backed securities prepayments  the length of interest rate cycles  and the slope of the interest rate yield curve  net interest income could fluctuate more than simulated under alco scenarios modeled 
results of operations the company s results of operations are dependent primarily on net interest income  which is the difference between the income earned on its loan  securities and investment portfolios and its cost of funds  consisting of the interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
results of operations are also affected by the company s noninterest income  provision for loan losses and noninterest expenses 
general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in interest rates  prepayment rates of mortgage backed securities and loans  repricings of loan relationships  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities  also significantly affect the company s results of operations 
future changes in applicable law  regulations or government policies may also have a material impact on the company 
comparison of operating results for the years ending december  compared to december  overview during the year ended december   the company s net income increased million or to million  from million for the same period in the increase in net income was primarily attributable to an increase in noninterest income and net interest income due to the increase in earning assets 
noninterest income increased primarily due to the increases in deposit services income  bank owned life insurance income  mortgage servicing release fees income  and other noninterest income 
these increases were partially offset by an increase in noninterest expense and provision for loan losses 
the majority of the increase in noninterest expense was a result of bank growth and the costs associated with the opening of five new branches 
earnings per share of represented an increase of or over the year ended december  net interest income net interest income is the principal source of a financial institution s earnings stream and represents the difference or spread between interest and fee income generated from interest earning assets and the interest expense paid on deposits and borrowed funds 
fluctuations in interest rates as well as volume and mix changes in interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities materially impact net interest income 
net interest income for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million or compared to the same period in the overall increase in net interest income was due to the fact that decreases in interest income from loans and securities were more than offset by decreases in interest expense from deposits and other borrowings which increased the net yield on average interest earning assets 
average interest earning assets increased million or  and the net yield on average interest earning assets increased from at december  to at december  during the fourth quarter ended december  the company s net interest margin was and the net interest spread was which reflected a decrease when compared to the same quarter in the net interest margin and net interest spread for the quarter ended december  was and  respectively 
the decrease in the net interest margin and spread during the fourth quarter of was due in part to lower mortgage interest rates and the lower overall interest rate environment which led to substantially increased residential mortgage refinancings nationwide and in the company s market area combined with substantially increased repricings of all of the company s other loan types 
increased prepayments associated with the company s mortgage backed securities  residential mortgage loans and the substantial increase in repricings of other loan types may continue to impact the company s net interest margin during the first half of or until overall interest rates increase 
this may be partially offset by fee income from the sale of mortgage loans into the secondary market due to the volume of refinancings that the company is currently handling in its market area or changes in its balance sheet mix 
as interest rates decreased during  the company s yield on premium mortgage backed securities decreased as prepayment speeds increased 
this decrease in yield  along with the decrease in the yield on average loans  combined to decrease the net yield on average earning assets 
during the year ended december   average loans  funded by the growth in average deposits  increased million or  compared to the same period in the average yield on loans decreased from at december  to at december   reflective of an overall decrease in interest rates 
as interest rates have declined  especially short term interest rates  loan customers are increasingly requesting floating rate loans  which lowers the overall yield on loans 
in addition  the company has experienced a large number of loan customers requesting loan repricings due to lower interest rates offered to them by competing financial institutions 
if interest rates remain low or move lower the company anticipates it will be required to meet lower interest rate offers from competing financial institutions in order to retain quality loan relationships  which could impact the overall loan yield 
the decrease in interest income on loans of million or was the result of the decrease in interest rates partially offset by the increase in average loans 
average investment and mortgage backed securities increased million or for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in this increase was primarily a result of a slight increase in the company s leverage strategy 
the overall yield on average investment and mortgage backed securities decreased to during the year ended december  from during the same period in  due in part to increased prepayment speeds on mortgage backed securities which led to increased amortization expense and increased cash to reinvest in a lower interest rate environment 
during the repositioning of the securities portfolio in an attempt to lower duration also decreased the overall yield on the securities portfolio 
interest income on investment and mortgage backed securities decreased million in or compared to due to the decrease in the average yield of securities during  which more than offset the increase in the average balance 
interest income from marketable equity securities  federal funds and other interest earning assets decreased  or for the year ended december  when compared to as a result of lower interest rates in during the year ended december   the mix of the company s interest earning assets reflected an increase in loans compared to the prior year end as loans averaged of total average interest earning assets compared to during  a direct result of loan growth 
securities averaged of the total and other interest earning asset categories averaged for december  during the comparable mix was in securities and in the other interest earning asset categories 
total interest expense decreased million or to million during the year ended december  as compared to million during the same period in the decrease was attributable to a decrease in interest rates partially offset by an increase in average interest bearing liabilities of million or 
average interest bearing deposits increased million or while the average rate paid decreased from at december  to at december  average time deposits increased million or while the average rate paid decreased basis points 
average interest bearing demand deposits increased million or while the average rate paid decreased basis points 
average savings deposits increased million or while the average rate paid decreased basis points 
average noninterest bearing demand deposits increased million or during the latter three categories  which are considered the lowest cost deposits  comprised of total average deposits during the year ended december  compared to during and during the increase in average total deposits is reflective of overall bank growth and branch expansion 
during the second quarter ended june   the company issued million of long term brokered cds with one year call options and additional call options every six months thereafter  until the cds mature 
the average yield on these cds was with an average life of years 
obtaining this long term funding enabled the bank to take advantage of the higher interest rate environment  primarily through the purchase of securities without incurring significant additional interest rate risk 
the higher cost associated with these callable cds had a negative impact on net interest spread during the five quarters ended june  the options associated with these cds provided the bank with valuable balance sheet opportunities 
in conjunction with the issuance of these long term brokered cds  securities were purchased with an overall duration and yield that approximated the brokered cds 
during march  the company notified cd holders that million of brokered cds were being called april  the company recorded  of additional interest expense associated with the call of the cds during the first quarter ended march  gains on sales of securities were used to offset this expense 
during april  the company notified cd holders that the remaining million of brokered cds would be called may  an additional  of expense was incurred during the second quarter ending june   associated with the call of the brokered cds 
these cds were replaced with long term advances from the fhlb dallas at an average rate of approximately 
as a result  the company s interest expense on this million declined after the cds were called 
the company s current policy allows for a maximum of million in brokered cds 
the potential higher interest cost and lack of customer loyalty are risks associated with the use of brokered cds 
at december  and december   the company had no brokered cds and brokered cds represented zero percent of deposits

the company sold securities out of its afs portfolio to accomplish asset liability committee and investment portfolio objectives aimed at repositioning and reducing the overall duration of the securities portfolio in an effort to maximize the total return of the securities portfolio 
sales of afs securities were the result of changes in economic conditions and a change in the desired mix of the securities portfolio 
during  interest rates declined and the yield curve remained steep 
the company used this interest rate environment to reposition the securities portfolio in an attempt to lower the overall duration and minimize prepayment of the premium mortgage backed securities 
higher coupon premium mortgage backed securities with high selling prices or with a potentially greater prepayment exposure were replaced with mortgage backed securities that had characteristics which potentially might reduce the prepayment exposure 
in some cases  higher coupon premium year mortgage backed securities with prepayment exposure were replaced with lower coupon premium year mortgage backed securities which lowered the overall duration and potentially reduced the prepayment exposure 
specific lower coupon or long duration municipal securities were sold and partially replaced with higher coupon municipal securities

retirement expense for could increase significantly due to a possible low return on plan assets  the continued low discount rate or a possible decrease in this rate  increased funding required and the increasing numbers of participants 
the company is currently using a assumed long term rate of return 
due to the decline in major stock market indexes for three straight years combined with low interest rates the company s rate of return on plan assets did not achieve a return 
the company will continue to evaluate the assumed long term rate of return of to determine if it should be changed in the future 
if this assumption were decreased the cost and funding required for the retirement plan could increase

the company sold securities out of its afs portfolio to accomplish asset liability committee and investment portfolio objectives aimed at repositioning and reducing the overall duration of the securities portfolio and maximizing the total return of the securities portfolio 
sales of afs securities were the result of changes in economic conditions and a change in the desired mix of the securities portfolio 
during  interest rates declined and the yield curve steepened as short term interest rates decreased significantly more than long term interest rates 
the company used this interest rate environment to reposition the securities portfolio in an attempt to lower the overall duration

during the third quarter of  the company issued a stock dividend  which had no net effect on shareholders equity 
the company s dividend policy requires that any cash dividend payments made by the company not exceed consolidated earnings for that year

the payment of dividends will depend upon future earnings  the financial condition of the company  and other related factors 
the bank is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on the bank s financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  the bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the bank s assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the bank s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings  and other factors 
quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the bank to maintain minimum amounts and ratios set forth in the table below of total and tier capital as defined in the regulations to risk weighted assets as defined  and of tier capital as defined to average assets as defined 
management believes  as of december   that the bank meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject

 accounting for asset retirement obligations fas 
fas requires liability recognition for retirement obligations associated with tangible long lived assets 
the obligations included within the scope of fas are those for which a company faces a legal obligation for settlement 
the initial measurement of the asset retirement obligation is to be at fair value 
the asset retirement cost equal to the fair value of the retirement obligation is to be capitalized as part of the cost of the related long lived asset and amortized to expense over the useful life of the asset 
fas is effective for all fiscal years beginning after june  the company does not believe that fas will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in april  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 rescission of fas   and  amendment of fas  and technical corrections fas 
this statement updates  clarifies and simplifies existing accounting pronouncements with respect to the accounting for gains and losses from the extinguishments of debt 
fas required all gains and losses from extinguishments of debt to be aggregated and  if material  classified as an extraordinary item  net of related tax effect 
as a result of the rescission of fas  the criteria in apb opinion no 
will now be used to classify those gains and losses 
the provisions of this statement are applicable to transactions occurring after january  the adoption of fas will not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities fas 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the principal difference between this statement and issue relates to its requirements for recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity 
this statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under issue  a liability for an exit cost as defined in issue was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
a fundamental conclusion reached by the board in this statement is that an entity commitment to a plan  by itself  does not create a present obligation to others that meets the definition of a liability 
therefore  this statement eliminates the definition and requirements for recognition of exit costs in issue this statement also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
the provisions of this statement are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   with early application encouraged 
the company does not believe that fas will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in october  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 acquisitions of certain financial institutions fas 
this statement is an amendment of fas statements no 
and and fas interpretation no 
fas statement no 
 accounting for certain acquisitions of banking or thrift institutions  and fasb interpretation no 
 applying apb opinions no 
and when a savings and loan association or a similar institution is acquired in a business combination accounted for by the purchase method  provided interpretive guidance on the application of the purchase method to acquisitions of financial institutions 
except for transactions between two or more mutual enterprises  this statement removes acquisitions of financial institutions from the scope of both fas and interpretation and requires that those transactions be accounted for in accordance with fas  business combinations  and fas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
thus  the requirement in paragraph of fas to recognize and subsequently amortize any excess of the fair value of liabilities assumed over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired as an unidentifiable intangible asset no longer applies to acquisitions within the scope of this statement 
in addition  this statement amends fas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  to include in its scope long term customer relationship intangible assets of financial institutions such as depositor and borrower relationship intangible assets and credit cardholder intangible assets 
consequently  those intangible assets are subject to the same undiscounted cash flow recoverability test and impairment loss recognition and measurement provisions that fas requires for other long lived assets that are held and used 
the company does not believe that fas will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure fas 
this statement is an amendment of fas statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of fas to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
fas permits two additional transition methods for entities that adopt the preferable method of accounting for stock based compensation 
this statement requires disclosure of comparable information for all companies regardless of whether  when  or how an entity adopts the preferable  fair value based method of accounting 
in addition  fas prescribes a specific tabular format and requires disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies or its equivalent 
the company has complied with the required disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
on november   the financial accounting standards board fasb or the board issued fasb interpretation no

  and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
fin clarifies the requirements of fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies fas  relating to the guarantor s accounting for  and disclosure of  the issuance of certain types of guarantees 
the interpretation covers guarantee contracts that have any of the following four characteristics contracts that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying that is related to an asset  a liability  or an equity security of the guaranteed party eg  financial and market value guarantees  contracts that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party based on another entity s failure to perform under an obligating agreement performance guarantees  indemnification agreements that contingently require the indemnifying party guarantor to make payments to the indemnified party guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying that is related to an asset  a liability  or an equity security of the indemnified party  such as an adverse judgment in a lawsuit or the imposition of additional taxes due to either a change in the tax law or an adverse interpretation of the tax law  and indirect guarantees of the indebtedness of others  as that phrase was used in fin fin supersedes fin by incorporating in it  without change  that guidance 
for guarantees that fall within the scope of fin  the interpretation requires that guarantors recognize a liability equal to the fair value of the guarantee upon its issuance 
in addition to the disclosures required by current gaap related to guarantees eg  fasb statement no 
 no 
 related party disclosures  and no 
 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments  this interpretation requires entities to disclose the following information about each guarantee  or each group of similar guarantees  even if the likelihood of the guarantor s having to make any payments under the guarantee is remote a 
the nature of the guarantee  including the approximate term of the guarantee  how the guarantee arose  and the events or circumstances that would require the guarantor to perform under the guarantee 
b 
the maximum potential amount of future payments undiscounted the guarantor could be required to make under the guarantee 
that maximum potential amount of future payments shall not be reduced by the effect of any amounts that may possibly be recovered under recourse or collateralization provisions in the guarantee 
if the terms of the guarantee provide for no limitation to the maximum potential future payments under the guarantee  that fact shall be disclosed 
if the guarantor is unable to develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of future payments under its guarantee  the guarantor shall disclose the reasons why it cannot estimate the maximum potential amount 
c 
the current carrying amount of the liability  if any  for the guarantor s obligations under the guarantee including the amount  if any  recognized under paragraph of fas  regardless of whether the guarantee is freestanding or embedded in another contract 
d 
the nature of any recourse provisions that would enable the guarantor to recover from third parties any of the amounts paid under the guarantee and any assets held either as collateral or by third parties that  upon the occurrence of any triggering event or condition under the guarantee  the guarantor can obtain and liquidate to recover all or a portion of the amounts paid under the guarantee 
the guarantor shall indicate  if estimable  the approximate extent to which the proceeds from liquidation of those assets would be expected to cover the maximum potential amount of future payments under the guarantee 
the interpretation s provisions for initial recognition and measurement should be applied on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   irrespective of the guarantor s fiscal year end 
the guarantor s previous accounting for guarantees that were issued before the date of fin s initial application may not be revised or restated to reflect the effect of the recognition and measurement provisions of the interpretation 
the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of both interim and annual periods that end after december  the company does not believe that fin will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
on january   the financial accounting standards board fasb or the board issued fasb interpretation no 
fin or the interpretation  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
the primary objective of the interpretation is to provide guidance on the identification of  and financial reporting for  entities over which control is achieved through means other than voting rights  such entities are known as variable interest entities vies 
although the fasb s initial focus was on special purpose entities spes  the final guidance applies to a wide range of entities 
fin has far reaching effects and applies to new entities that are created after the effective date  as well as applies to existing entities 
once it goes into effect  fin will be the guidance that determines whether consolidation is required under the controlling financial interest model of accounting research bulletin no 
arb  consolidated financial statements  or b other existing authoritative guidance  or  alternatively  whether the variable interest model under fin should be used to account for existing and new entities 
the effective dates and transition provisions of the interpretation are as follows public companies will be required to apply the interpretation to preexisting entities as of the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  all enterprises should apply the interpretation to vies with which they become involved beginning february  all enterprises will be required to apply the transition disclosure requirements in financial statements issued after february  the company does not believe fin will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
effects of inflation the consolidated financial statements of the company  and their related notes  have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  that require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering the change in the relative purchasing power of money over time and due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the company s operations 
unlike many industrial companies  nearly all of the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods and services 
management of liquidity liquidity management involves the ability to convert assets to cash with a minimum of loss 
the company must be capable of meeting its obligations to its customers at any time 
this means addressing the immediate cash withdrawal requirements of depositors and other funds providers  the funding requirements of all lines and letters of credit  and the short term credit needs of customers 
liquidity is provided by short term investments that can be readily liquidated with a minimum risk of loss 
cash  interest earning deposits  federal funds sold and short term investments with maturities or repricing characteristics of one year or less continue to be a substantial percentage of total assets 
at december   these investments were of total assets  as compared with for december   and for december  liquidity is further provided through the matching  by time period  of rate sensitive interest earning assets with rate sensitive interest bearing liabilities 
the company has three lines of credit for the purchase of federal funds 
two million and one million unsecured lines of credit have been established with bank of america  frost bank and texas independent bank  respectively 
the asset liability management committee of the bank closely monitors various liquidity ratios  interest rate spreads and margins  interest rate shock reports and market value of portfolio equity with rates shocked plus and minus basis points to ensure the company a satisfactory liquidity position 
market value of portfolio equity is defined as the net present value of an institution s existing assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments 
market value of portfolio equity analysis is one of the general measures used by regulatory authorities for assessing an institution s interest rate risk 
the extent to which assets will gain or lose value in relation to the gains or losses of liabilities and or interest rate contracts determines the appreciation or depreciation in equity on a market value basis 
such market value analysis is intended to evaluate the impact of immediate and sustained parallel interest rate shifts of the current yield curve upon the market value of the current balance sheet 
in addition  the bank utilizes a simulation model to determine the impact on net interest income under several different interest rate scenarios 
by utilizing this technology  the bank attempts to determine changes that need to be made to the asset and liability mix to minimize the change in net interest income under these various interest rate scenarios 
the table on page shows the expected maturities for interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the banking industry  a major risk exposure is changing interest rates 
the primary objective of monitoring the company s interest rate sensitivity  or risk  is to provide management the tools necessary to manage the balance sheet to minimize adverse changes in net interest income as a result of changes in the direction and level of interest rates 
federal reserve board monetary control efforts  the effects of deregulation and legislative changes have been significant factors affecting the task of managing interest rate sensitivity positions in recent years 
the interest rate risk inherent in assets and liabilities may be determined by analyzing the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by measuring an institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a defined time period if it matures or reprices within that period 
the difference or mismatch between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a defined period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within the same period is defined as the interest rate sensitivity gap 
an institution is considered to have a negative gap if the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a specified time period exceeds the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within the same period 
if more interest earning assets than interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice within a specified period  then the institution is considered to have a positive gap 
accordingly  in a rising interest rate environment in an institution with a negative gap  the cost of its rate sensitive liabilities would theoretically rise at a faster pace than the yield on its rate sensitive assets  thereby diminishing future net interest income 
in a falling interest rate environment  a negative gap would indicate that the cost of rate sensitive liabilities would decline at a faster pace than the yield on rate sensitive assets and improve net interest income 
for an institution with a positive gap  the reverse would be expected 
the table on page shows interest sensitivity gaps for four different intervals as of december  in an attempt to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates  management closely monitors the company s exposure to interest rate risk 
management maintains an asset liability committee which meets regularly and reviews the company s interest rate risk position and makes recommendations for adjusting this position 
in addition  the board reviews on a monthly basis the company s asset liability position 
the company primarily uses two methods for measuring and analyzing interest rate risk net income simulation analysis and market value of portfolio equity modeling 
through these simulations the company attempts to estimate the impact on net interest income of a basis point parallel shift in the yield curve 
policy guidelines limit the estimated change in net interest income to percent of forecasted net income over the succeeding months and basis point parallel rate shock 
policy guidelines limit the change in market value of equity in a basis point parallel rate shock to percent of the base case 
the results of the valuation analysis as of december   were within policy guidelines 
this type of stimulation analysis requires numerous assumptions including but not limited to changes in balance sheet mix  prepayment rates on mortgage related assets and fixed rate loans  cash flows and repricings of all financial instruments  changes in volumes and pricing  future shapes of the yield curve  relationship of market interest rates to each other basis risk  credit spread and deposit sensitivity 
assumptions are based on management s best estimates but may not accurately reflect actual results under certain changes in interest rates 
the following table provides information about the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates

consumer loans are assumed to prepay at an annualized rate between and 
commercial loans are assumed to prepay at an annual rate between and 
municipal loans are assumed to prepay at an annual rate between and 
fixed and adjustable rate mortgage backed securities  including collateralized mortgage obligations cmos and real estate mortgage investment conduits remics  have annual payment assumptions ranging from to 
at december   the contractual maturity of substantially all of the company s mortgage backed or related securities was in excess of ten years 
the actual maturity of a mortgage backed or related security is less than its stated maturity due to regular principal payments and prepayments of the underlying mortgages 
prepayments that are faster than anticipated may shorten the life of the security and affect its yield to maturity 
the yield to maturity is based upon the interest income and the amortization of any premium or discount related to the security 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  premiums and discounts are amortized over the estimated lives of the loans  which decrease and increase interest income  respectively 
the prepayment assumptions used to determine the amortization period for premiums and discounts can significantly affect the yield of the mortgage backed or related security  and these assumptions are reviewed periodically to reflect actual prepayments 
although prepayments of underlying mortgages depend on many factors  including the type of mortgages  the coupon rate  the age of mortgages  the geographical location of the underlying real estate collateralizing the mortgages and general levels of market interest rates  the difference between the interest rates on the underlying mortgages and the prevailing mortgage interest rates generally is the most significant determinant of the rate of prepayments 
during periods of falling mortgage interest rates  if the coupon rate of the underlying mortgages exceeds the prevailing market interest rates offered for mortgage loans  refinancing may increase and accelerate the prepayment of the underlying mortgages and the related security 
at december   of the million of mortgage backed and related securities held by the company  an aggregate of million were secured by fixed rate mortgage loans and an aggregate of million were secured by adjustable rate mortgage loans 
the company assumes of savings accounts and transaction accounts at december   are core deposits and are  therefore  expected to roll off after five years 
the company assumes of money market accounts at december  are core deposits and are  therefore  expected to roll off after five years 
the company does not consider any of its platinum money market accounts as core deposits 
no roll off rate is applied to certificates of deposit 
fixed maturity deposits reprice at maturity 
in evaluating the company s exposure to interest rate risk  certain limitations inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table must be considered 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgages  have features which restrict changes in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels may deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
the company considers all of these factors in monitoring its exposure to interest rate risk

the asset liability management committee of southside bank closely monitors the desired gap along with various liquidity ratios to ensure a satisfactory liquidity position for the company 
management continually evaluates the condition of the economy  the pattern of market interest rates and other economic data to determine the types of investments that should be made and at what maturities 
using this analysis  management from time to time assumes calculated interest sensitivity gap positions to maximize net interest income based upon anticipated movements in the general level of interest rates 
regulatory authorities also monitor the bank s gap position along with other liquidity ratios 
in addition  the bank utilizes a simulation model to determine the impact of net interest income under several different interest rate scenarios 
by utilizing this technology  the bank can determine changes that need to be made to the asset and liability mixes to minimize the change in net interest income under these various interest rate scenarios
