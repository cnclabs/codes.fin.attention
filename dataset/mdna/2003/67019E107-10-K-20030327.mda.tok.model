item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a overview nstar is an energy delivery company focusing its activities in the transmission and distribution of energy 
nstar serves approximately million customers in massachusetts  including approximately million electric customers in communities and million gas customers in communities 
nstar is a public utility holding company generally exempt from the provisions of the public utility holding company act of nstar s retail utility subsidiaries are boston edison company boston edison  commonwealth electric company comelectric  cambridge electric light company cambridge electric and nstar gas company nstar gas 
its wholesale electric subsidiary is canal electric company canal 
nstar s three retail electric companies operate under the brand name nstar electric 
reference in this report to nstar shall mean the registrant nstar or one or more of its subsidiaries as the context requires 
reference in this report to nstar electric shall mean each of boston edison  comelectric and cambridge electric 
nstar s non utility  unregulated operations include district energy operations advanced energy systems  inc and nstar steam corporation  telecommunications operations nstar communications  inc nstar com and a liquefied natural gas service company hopkinton lng corp utility operations accounted for approximately of revenues in  and cautionary statement this md a contains certain forward looking statements such as forecasts and projections of expected future performance or statements of management s plans and objectives 
these forward looking statements may also be contained in other filings with the sec  in press releases and oral statements 
you can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 
they use words such as anticipate  estimate  expect  project  intend  plan  believe and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance 
these statements are based on the current expectations  estimates or projections of management and are not guarantees of future performance 
some or all of these forward looking statements may not turn out to be what nstar expected 
actual results could potentially differ materially from these statements 
therefore  no assurance can be given that the outcomes stated in such forward looking statements and estimates will be achieved 
the impact of continued cost control procedures on operating results could differ from current expectations 
nstar s revenues from its electric and gas sales are sensitive to weather  the economy and other variable conditions 
accordingly  nstar s sales in any given period reflect  in addition to other factors  the impact of weather  with colder winter temperatures generally resulting in increased gas sales and warmer summer temperatures generally resulting in increased electric sales 
nstar anticipates that these sensitivities to seasonal and other weather conditions will continue to impact its sales forecasts in future periods 
the effects of changes in weather  economic conditions  tax rates  interest rates  technology  and prices and availability of operating supplies could materially affect the projected operating results 
nstar s forward looking information is based in large measure on prevailing governmental policies and regulatory actions  including those of the mdte and the ferc  with respect to allowed rates of return  rate structure  continued recovery of regulatory assets  financings  purchased power and cost of gas recovery  acquisition and disposition of assets  operation and construction of facilities  changes in tax laws and policies and changes in and compliance with environmental and safety laws and policies 
the impacts of various environmental  legal  and regulatory matters could differ from current expectations 
new regulations or changes to existing regulations could impose additional operating requirements or liabilities other than expected 
the effects of changes in specific hazardous waste site conditions and the specific cleanup technology could affect the estimated cleanup liabilities 
the impacts of changes in available information and circumstances regarding legal issues could affect any estimated litigation costs 
nstar undertakes no obligation to publicly update forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events  or otherwise 
you are advised  however  to consult all further disclosures nstar makes in its filings to the sec 
also note that nstar provided in the above paragraphs a cautionary discussion of risks and other uncertainties relative to its business 
these are factors that could cause its actual results to differ materially from expected and historical performance 
other factors in addition to those listed here could also adversely affect nstar 
this report also describes material contingencies and critical accounting policies and estimates in this section and in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements  and nstar encourages a review of these notes 
critical accounting policies and estimates nstar s discussion and analysis of its financial condition  results of operations and cash flows are based upon the accompanying consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements required management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgment and uncertainties  and potentially may result in materially different outcomes under different assumptions and conditions 
nstar believes that its accounting policies and estimates that are most critical to the reported results of operations  cash flows and financial position are described below 
a 
revenue recognition utility revenues are based on authorized rates approved by the mdte and ferc 
estimates of transmission  distribution and transition revenues for electricity and natural gas delivered to customers but not yet billed are accrued at the end of each accounting period 
the determination of unbilled revenues requires management to estimate the volume and pricing of electricity and gas delivered to customers prior to actual meter readings 
revenues related to the sale  transmission and distribution of energy are generally recorded when service is rendered or energy is delivered to customers 
however  the determination of the energy sales to individual customers is based on the reading of their meters that are read on a systematic basis throughout the month 
meters which are not read during a given month are estimated and trued up in a future period 
at the end of each month  amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last billing date are estimated and the corresponding unbilled revenue is estimated 
this unbilled electric revenue is estimated each month based on daily generation volumes territory load  line losses and applicable customer rates 
unbilled natural gas revenues are estimated based on estimated purchased gas volumes and tariffed rates in effect 
accrued unbilled revenues recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as of december  and were million and million  respectively 
nstar s non utility revenues are recognized when services are rendered or when the energy is delivered 
revenues are based  for the most part  on long term contractual rates 
b 
regulatory accounting nstar follows accounting policies prescribed by gaap  the ferc and the mdte 
as a rate regulated company  nstar is subject to the financial accounting standards board  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas 
the application of sfas results in differences in the timing of recognition of certain revenues and expenses from that of other businesses and industries 
nstar s energy delivery business remains subject to rate regulation and continues to meet the criteria for application of sfas this ratemaking process results in the recording of regulatory assets based on the probability of current and future cash inflows 
regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery in customer rates 
as of december  and  nstar has recorded regulatory assets of billion and billion  respectively 
this increase is primarily the result of the recognition of certain purchased power costs 
nstar continuously reviews these assets to assess their ultimate recoverability within the approved regulatory guidelines 
nstar expects to fully recover these regulatory assets in its rates 
if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable  nstar would be required to charge these assets to current earnings 
however  impairment risk associated with these assets relates to potentially adverse legislative  judicial or regulatory actions in the future 
regulatory assets related to the generation business are recovered through the transition charge 
c 
derivative instruments power contracts typically  the electric power industry contracts to buy and sell electricity under option contracts  which allow the buyer some flexibility in determining when to take electricity and in what quantity to match fluctuating demand 
these contracts would normally meet the definition of a derivative requiring mark to market accounting 
however  because electricity cannot be stored and an entity is obligated to maintain sufficient capacity to meet the electricity needs of its customer base  an option contract for the purchase of electricity typically qualifies for the normal purchases and sales exception described in sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and derivative implementation group dig issue no 
c  scope exceptions normal purchases and normal sales exception for option type contracts and forward contracts in electricity 
nstar electric has long term purchased power agreements that are used primarily to meet its standard offer obligation 
the majority of these agreements are above market but are not reflected on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as they qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception 
however  in issue c  the dig concluded that contracts with a pricing mechanism that are subject to future adjustment based on a generic index that is not specifically related to the contracted service commodity generally would not qualify for the normal purchases and sales exception 
nstar has six purchased power contracts that contain components with pricing mechanisms that are based on a pricing index  such as the gnp or cpi 
although these factors are only applied to certain ancillary pricing components of these agreements  as required by the interpretation of dig issue c  nstar began recording these contracts at fair value on its consolidated balance sheets during this action resulted in the recognition of a liability for the fair value of the above market portion of these contracts at december  of approximately million and is reflected as a component of deferred credits power contracts on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
these contracts are valued using a discounted cash flow model and a discount rate 
the market value assumption used was provided by a third party who determines such pricing for the new england power market 
had management used an alternative assumption  the value of these contracts at december  would have changed significantly 
a one percent increase or decrease to the discount rate would change the above market value by approximately million from what is presently recorded 
nstar electric recovers all of its electricity supply costs  including the above market costs 
the recovery of its above market costs occurs through for boston edison  through for comelectric and through for cambridge electric 
these recovery periods coincide with the contractual terms of these purchased power agreements 
therefore  in addition to the liability recorded  nstar also recorded a corresponding regulatory asset representing the future recovery of these actual costs 
d 
pension and other postretirement benefits nstar s pension and other postretirement benefits costs are dependent upon several factors and assumptions  such as employee demographics  the level of cash contributions made to the plans  earnings on the plans assets  the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on the plans assets and health care cost trends 
in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions sfas  changes in pension and postretirement benefit obligations other than pensions pbop associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension and pbop costs in the statements of income  but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of the plans participants 
there were no changes to nstar s pension plan benefits in  and that had a significant impact on recorded pension costs 
as further described in note g to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  nstar has revised the discount rate in as compared to and in addition  nstar revised the expected long term rate of return on its pension and pbop plan assets for to and  respectively  reduced from and in  respectively 
these changes will have a significant impact on reported pension costs in future years in accordance with the cost recognition approach of sfas described above 
this impact will be mitigated  to an extent  through nstar s regulatory accounting treatment of pension and pbop costs 
see further discussion of regulatory accounting treatment below 
in determining pension obligation and cost amounts  these assumptions may change from period to period  and such changes could result in material changes to recorded pension and pbop costs and funding requirements 
nstar s pension plan the plan assets  which partially consist of equity investments  have been affected by significant declines in the equity markets in the past three years 
fluctuations in equity market returns may result in increased or decreased pension costs in future periods 
these conditions impacted the funded status of the plan at december   and therefore  will also impact pension costs for the following chart reflects the projected benefit obligation and cost sensitivities associated with a change in certain actuarial assumptions by the indicated percentage 
each sensitivity below reflects an evaluation of the change based solely on a change in that assumption 
in thousands impact on projected benefit impact on cost actuarial assumption change in assumption obligation increase decrease pension increase in discount rate basis points   decrease in discount rate basis points   increase in expected long term rate of return on plan assets basis points na  decrease in expected long term rate of return on plan assets basis points na  other postretirement benefits increase in discount rate basis points   decrease in discount rate basis points   increase in expected long term rate of return on plan assets basis points na  decrease in expected long term rate of return on plan assets basis points na  na not applicable nstar s discount rate is based on rates of high quality corporate bonds as published by nationally recognized rating agencies 
in determining the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  nstar considers past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plan 
in  nstar reduced the expected long term rate of return on plan assets from to as a result of the prevailing outlook for equity market returns 
reported pension costs will increase in and future years as a result of this changed assumption 
however  as a result of the mdte accounting order accounting order discussed below  this increase will not have a material impact on nstar s results of operations 
the unfavorable market conditions have impacted the value of plan assets 
as a result of the negative investment performance  the plan s accumulated benefit obligation abo exceeded plan assets at december  the abo represents the present value of benefits earned without considering future salary increases 
since the fair value of its plan assets is less than the abo  nstar is required to record this difference as an additional minimum pension liability on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
under sfas  nstar is also required to eliminate its prepaid pension balance 
the additional minimum pension liability adjustment is equal to the sum of the minimum pension liability and the prepaid pension that would be recorded  net of taxes  as a non cash charge to other comprehensive income oci on the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income 
the fair value of plan assets and the abo are measured at each year end balance sheet date 
the minimum liability will be adjusted each year to reflect this measurement 
at such time that the plan assets exceed the abo  the minimum liability would be reversed 
in november  nstar filed a request with the mdte seeking an accounting ruling to mitigate the impact of the non cash charge to oci in and the increases in expected pension and pbop costs in on december   the mdte approved the accounting order 
based on this accounting order and an opinion from legal counsel regarding the probability of recovery of these costs in the future  nstar recorded a regulatory asset in lieu of taking a charge to oci at december  in addition  the accounting order permits nstar to defer  as a regulatory asset or liability  the difference between the level of pension and pbop expenses that are included in rates and the amounts that are required to be recorded under sfas and sfas beginning in the regulatory asset of million  recorded as a result of this accounting order  consists of the prepaid pension asset million related to the qualified pension plan and the minimum liability million incurred at december  the regulatory asset is shown separately in deferred debits on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
nstar s utility subsidiaries anticipate filing with the mdte  during  a specific mechanism designed to address pension and pbop costs 
it is nstar s goal to eliminate the volatility of these costs 
the plan currently meets the minimum funding requirements of the employee retirement income security act of while not required to make contributions to the plan  nstar anticipates increasing the level of its cash contributions to the plan in to mitigate the projected adverse impact 
such cash contributions may be material to its consolidated cash flows from operations 
nstar believes it has adequate access to capital resources to support these contributions 
e 
investments available for sale securities nstar classifies its investments in marketable securities as available for sale 
as of december   these investments include million common shares of rcn corporation rcn and represent approximately of rcn s outstanding common shares 
as of december   these investments included million common shares of rcn   common shares of john hancock financial services  inc john hancock  and  common shares of metlife  inc metlife 
during  nstar sold all of its common shares in john hancock and metlife for a gain of million 
this gain is recorded as part of other income  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
in accordance with its accounting policies  nstar continuously evaluates the carrying value of its investment in rcn common shares to assess whether any decline in the market value below its carrying value is deemed to be other than temporary 
consistent with the performance of the telecommunications sector as a whole  the market value of rcn s common shares decreased significantly during the later part of and continued to decrease through as a result  in and  management determined that this decline in market value was other than temporary in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
nstar recognized non cash  after tax impairment charges in and on its investment in rcn common shares of million and million  respectively 
these charges are reported on the accompanying consolidated statements of income as write down of rcn investment  net 
the total carrying value of the million rcn common shares is included in other investments on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at its estimated fair value of approximately million at december  the fair value of the million shares held may increase or decrease as a result of changes in the market value of rcn common shares 
as of december  and  the market value per share of rcn was and  respectively 
the unrealized gain or loss associated with these shares will fluctuate due to the changes in fair value of these securities during each period and is reflected  net of associated income taxes  as a component of other comprehensive income  net on the accompanying consolidated statements of comprehensive income 
the cumulative increase or decrease in fair value of these shares including the impact of the write down adjustments of these shares are included in accumulated other comprehensive income on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
f 
decommissioning cost estimates the accounting for decommissioning costs of nuclear power plants involves significant estimates related to costs to be incurred many years in the future 
changes in these estimates will not affect nstar s results of operations or cash flows because these costs will be collected from customers through nstar s transition charge filings with the mdte 
while nstar no longer directly owns any nuclear power plants  nstar electric collectively owns  through its equity investments  of connecticut yankee atomic power company cyapc  of yankee atomic electric company yaec  and of maine yankee atomic power company  the yankee companies 
periodically  nstar obtains estimates from the management of the yankee companies on the cost of decommissioning the connecticut yankee nuclear unit cy  the yankee atomic nuclear unit ya  and the maine yankee nuclear unit my 
these nuclear units are completely shut down and are currently conducting decommissioning activities 
based on estimates from the yankee companies management as of december   the total remaining cost for decommissioning each nuclear unit is approximately as follows million for cy  million for ya and million for my 
of these amounts  nstar electric is obligated to pay million towards the decommissioning of cy  million toward ya  and million toward my 
these estimates are recorded in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as power contract liabilities with a correspond ing regulatory asset 
these estimates may be revised from time to time based on information available to the yankee companies regarding future costs 
nstar expects the yankee companies to seek recovery of these costs and any additional increases to these costs in rate applications with the ferc  with any resulting adjustments being charged to their respective sponsors  including nstar electric 
nstar electric would recover its share of any allowed increases from customers through the transition charge 
g 
asset impairment assessment nstar evaluates its assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist  but at least annually 
accounting standards require that if the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows from a company s asset is less than the carrying value of the asset  an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
the amount of impairment recognized is calculated by subtracting the fair value of the asset from the carrying value of the asset 
as discussed in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements  nstar has three operating segments  one of which is its unregulated operations that includes the telecommunications operations 
based on the current market performance of the telecommunications sector  nstar has reviewed and assessed for impairment  in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  its unregulated telecommunications assets 
nstar s judgments used in its assessment include  but are not limited to  future anticipated revenue streams and future operating costs 
nstar has determined  based on its probability assessment  that the total of the undiscounted expected future cash flows exceeded the carrying value of its unregulated telecommunications assets  therefore  no impairment loss was recognized as of december  although management believes that its estimates of future revenues and expenses are reasonable  it cannot assure the precision of such estimates 
should a further and continued deterioration of this business sector occur  nstar may be required to write down its carrying value of these assets 
in estimating future sales and operating costs of telecommunications services  nstar uses internal forecasts 
nstar develops these forecasts based on recent sales activity for these services in conjunction with anticipated economic patterns and planned and scheduled customer commitments for services 
for each assumption used in the analysis  nstar applied a probability factor to each of the future cash flow scenarios 
the probability factors used were determined based on management s experience in the telecommunications sector and the likelihood of a change in the economic environment 
new accounting standards see note a  new accounting standards  to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
generating assets divestiture a 
seabrook nuclear power station on november   fpl group  inc purchased of the majority ownership interest in the seabrook nuclear power station  including canal s ownership interest  for million  net of closing adjustments 
fpl group assumed responsibility for the ultimate decommissioning of the facility and received the seabrook decommissioning funds of approximately million at the closing 
canal s portion of the sale proceeds amounted to million  of which million was paid into the decommissioning trust as a final top off and million was used for other transaction costs 
the net proceeds of million were less than canal s remaining investment in seabrook 
the difference of approximately million will be included as a component of cambridge electric s and comelectric s transition cost recovery and is expected to be collected from comelectric s and cambridge electric s customers in through the transition charge 
as part of this sale  all purchased power agreements were terminated 
the seabrook sale did not have an impact on nstar s current results of operations 
the future impact of the sale will not have a material effect on results of operations  cash flow or financial position 
b 
blackstone station on august   cambridge electric reached a tentative agreement to sell blackstone station to harvard university harvard for million that will be used to reduce cambridge electric s transition charge 
at the same time  nstar steam signed an agreement with harvard to sell its blackstone steam assets and contracts to harvard for million 
the sale is subject to the approval of the mdte 
a filing with the mdte for regulatory approval for this transaction was made on november  under terms of this agreement  nstar steam will continue to manage the day to day operations of the steam plant on this site for one year after the sale 
cambridge electric is divesting its electric generating assets consistent with the provisions of the massachusetts electric restructuring act of restructuring act 
cambridge electric divested the majority of its non nuclear generating facilities in nstar anticipates completing the blackstone station sale in the second quarter of rate and regulatory proceedings a 
distribution rate proceedings on february   nstar notified the mdte that it is in the process of reviewing the test year cost of service for its utility subsidiaries in order to determine whether to request a general base rate increase 
this assessment coincides with the expiration of nstar s four year rate freeze presently in effect as part of the merger rate plan that created nstar 
if nstar decides not to seek a general base rate increase  nstar will request a specific rate recovery mechanism relating to pension and pbop costs in conjunction with the mdte accounting order dated december  management intends to finalize its decision on the appropriate regulatory proceedings during the second quarter of b 
merger rate plan an integral part of the merger of bec and com energy that created nstar was the rate plan of the retail utility subsidiaries that was approved by the mdte on july  and affirmed by the sjc in december as further discussed below 
significant elements of the rate plan included a four year distribution rate freeze  recovery of the acquisition premium goodwill over years and recovery of transaction and integration costs costs to achieve over years 
refer to the retail electric rates section of this md a for more information on retail rates and cost recovery 
on december   the sjc affirmed the mdte s decision to allow for the merger of bec and com energy as originally structured 
the sjc s decision finalized the resolution of all issues relating to the appeal  as described below 
this decision did not have an impact on nstar s or prior periods consolidated financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
the mdte order  which approved the rate plan associated with the merger  was appealed to the sjc by the massachusetts attorney general ag and a separate group that consisted of the energy consortium tec and harvard university harvard 
the ag  tec and harvard alleged that  in approving the rate plan and merger proposal  the mdte committed errors of law in the following areas in adopting a public interest standard  the mdte applied the wrong standard of review  and failed to investigate the propriety of rates and to determine that the resulting rates of boston edison  cambridge electric  comelectric and nstar gas were just and reasonable  that in permitting cambridge electric and comelectric to adjust their rates by million to reflect demand side management costs  the mdte failed to determine whether such an adjustment was warranted in light of other cost decreases  that the mdte s approval results in an arbitrary and unjustified sharing of benefits and costs between ratepayers and shareholders  and that the mdte s approval of the rate plan guarantees shareholders recovery of future costs without any future demonstration of customer savings 
the ag s brief included similar arguments in each of these areas and added that  in allowing recovery of the acquisition premium  the mdte improperly deviated from a cost basis in setting approved rates and the ratemaking policies in other jurisdictions 
c 
goodwill and costs to achieve the merger that created nstar was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
in accordance with the mdte s approval of a four year rate plan  the premium goodwill associated with the acquisition was approximately million  while the original estimate of transaction and integration costs to achieve the merger was million 
the merger premium is reflected on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as goodwill 
this premium will continue to be amortized over years and amounts to approximately million annually  while the costs to achieve cta are being amortized over years 
cta are the costs incurred to execute the merger including the employee costs for a voluntary severance program  costs of financial advisers  legal costs  and other transaction and systems integration costs 
cta is being amortized at an annual rate of million based on the original rate plan 
nstar will reconcile the actual cta costs incurred with the original estimate in a future rate proceeding 
this reconciliation will include a final accounting of the deductibility for income tax purposes of each component of cta 
the total cta is approximately million 
this increase from the original estimate is partially mitigated by the fact that the portion of cta that is not deductible for income tax purposes is approximately million lower than the original estimate 
nstar anticipates that these incremental costs are probable of recovery in future rates 
the cta and goodwill amounts were filed and approved as part of the rate plan 
d 
service quality index on october   and as subsequently updated  nstar electric and nstar gas filed proposed service quality plans for each company with the mdte 
the service quality plans established performance benchmarks effective january  for certain identified measures of service quality relating to customer service and billing performance  customer satisfaction  and reliability and safety performance 
the companies are required to report annually concerning their performance as to each measure and are subject to maximum penalties of up to two percent of transmission and distribution revenues should performance fail to meet the applicable benchmarks 
concurrently  nstar electric and nstar gas filed with the mdte a report of their performance on the identified service quality measures for the two twelve month periods ended august  and this report included a calculation of penalties in accordance with mdte guidelines 
on march   following hearings on the matter  the mdte issued an order imposing a service quality penalty of approximately million on nstar electric that was refunded to customers as a credit to their bills during the month of may this refund had no material effect on nstar s consolidated financial position  cash flows or results of operations in for the four month period ended december   the mdte determined that nstar s performance relative to service quality measures did not warrant a penalty assessment 
on february   nstar electric and nstar gas filed their service quality reports with the mdte that reflected significant improvements in reliability and performance and indicate that no penalty will be assessed for this period 
nstar accounts for its service quality penalties pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
accordingly  these penalties are monitored on a monthly basis to determine nstar s contingent liability  and if nstar determines it is probable that a liability has been incurred and is estimable  nstar would then accrue an appropriate liability 
annually  each nstar utility subsidiary makes a service quality performance filing with the mdte 
any settlement or rate order that would result in a different liability or credit level from what has been accrued would be adjusted in the period an agreement is reached with the mdte 
e 
retail electric rates the restructuring act requires electric distribution companies to obtain and resell power to retail customers through either standard offer service or default service for those who choose not to buy energy from a competitive energy supplier 
standard offer service will be available to eligible customers through february at prices approved by the mdte  set at levels so as to guarantee mandatory overall rate reductions provided by the restructuring act 
new retail customers in the nstar electric service territories and other customers who are no longer eligible for standard offer service and have not chosen to receive service from a competitive supplier are provided default service 
the price of default service is intended to reflect the average competitive market price for power 
as of december  and  customers of nstar electric had approximately and  respectively  of their load requirements provided by competitive suppliers 
in december  nstar electric filed proposed transition rate adjustments for  including a preliminary reconciliation of transition  transmission  standard offer and default service costs and revenues through the mdte subsequently approved tariffs for each retail electric subsidiary effective january  the filings were updated in february to include final costs and revenues for on november   boston edison and the ag received approval of a settlement agreement from the mdte resolving issues in boston edison s reconciliation of costs and revenues for the year among other issues  the settlement agreement includes an adjustment relating to the reconciliation of costs relating to securitization and efforts to mitigate costs incurred in relation to a purchased power agreement with hydro quebec 
as a result of this settlement agreement with the ag  boston edison recognized approximately million in additional transition charge revenues in this benefit was significantly offset by several other regulatory true up adjustments 
in december  nstar electric filed proposed transition rate adjustments for  including a preliminary reconciliation of costs and revenues through the mdte subsequently approved tariffs for each retail electric subsidiary effective january  the filings were updated in february to include final costs for the mdte approved the reconciliation of costs and revenues for boston edison through in its approval on november  of a settlement agreement between boston edison and the ag resolving all outstanding issues in boston edison s prior reconciliation filings 
as a part of this settlement  boston edison agreed to reduce the costs sought to be collected through the transition charge by approximately million as compared to the amounts that were originally sought 
this settlement did not have a material adverse effect on nstar s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
on june   the mdte issued its final orders on the reconciliation of comelectric and cambridge electric s transition  standard offer service  default service and transmission costs and revenues for comelectric and cambridge electric reached a settlement with the ag regarding the and reconciliation proceedings 
under this settlement  the companies future recovery of transition costs would be reduced by approximately million 
this settlement was approved by the mdte on june  and did not have a material adverse effect on nstar s consolidated financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
during  nstar electric s accumulated costs to provide default and standard offer service were in excess of the revenues it was allowed to bill customers by approximately million 
on january and july   nstar electric was permitted by the mdte to increase its rates to customers for standard offer and default service to collect this shortfall 
furthermore  when combined with the reduction in energy supply costs experienced in and through the first half of  rates were reduced on january   april   july  and january  as a result  nstar reflected a regulatory asset of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively  that are reflected as components of regulatory assets other on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
in december  the mdte approved a standard offer fuel index of cents per kilowatt hour kwh that was added to each nstar electric company s standard offer service rates for the first half of in june  the mdte approved an additional increase of cents per kwh effective july  based on a fuel adjustment formula contained in its standard offer tariffs to reflect the prices of natural gas and oil 
in december  the mdte approved a decrease in this fuel index of cents to cents per kwh for the first quarter of due to a decrease in the cost of fuel 
effective april   each nstar electric company s fuel index was set to zero 
the mdte has ruled that these fuel index adjustments are excluded from the rate reduction requirement under the restructuring act 
f 
standard market design effective march   the wholesale electric energy market in the northeast has been restructured into what is known as standard market design smd in conjunction with ferc orders issued in september and december of smd provides an additional market in which wholesale power costs can be hedged a day in advance through binding financial commitments 
also  under smd  wholesale power clearing prices vary by location  with prices increasing in areas where less efficient resources close to the load are dispatched to meet the load requirements due to the fact that the more efficient resources cannot be imported as a result of transmission limitations 
smd is not expected to have an impact on nstar s results of operations because of the recovery mechanism for wholesale energy costs approved by the mdte 
g 
natural gas industry restructuring and rates nstar gas generates revenues primarily through the sale and or transportation of natural gas 
gas sales and transportation services are divided into two categories firm  whereby nstar gas must supply gas and or transportation services to customers on demand  and interruptible  whereby nstar gas may  generally during colder months  temporarily discontinue service to high volume commercial and industrial customers 
sales and transportation of gas to interruptible customers do not materially affect nstar gas operating income because substantially the entire margin on such service is returned to its firm customers as rate reductions 
in addition to delivery service rates  nstar gas tariffs include a seasonal cost of gas adjustment clause cgac and a local distribution adjustment clause ldac 
the cgac provides for the recovery of all gas supply costs from firm sales customers or default service customers 
the ldac provides for the recovery of certain costs applicable to both sales and transportation customers 
the cgac is filed semi annually for approval by the mdte 
the ldac is filed annually for approval 
in addition  nstar gas is required to file interim changes to its cgac factor when the actual costs of gas supply vary from projections by more than 
due to significant declines in wholesale natural gas prices  nstar gas received six consecutive approvals from the mdte effective march  through october  to reduce the cgac factor and pass those savings on to customers 
in october  due to the increase in wholesale natural gas prices  nstar gas was allowed by the mdte to increase the cgac factor for the period from november  through january  to recover the higher costs of gas 
in both and  the cgac was revised on four occasions to reflect the changes in the cost of gas caused by varying market conditions 
in  the cgac ranged from per therm to while the range for was per therm to other legal matters in the normal course of its business  nstar and its subsidiaries are involved in certain legal matters  including civil lawsuits 
management is unable to fully determine a range of reasonably possible court ordered damages  settlement amounts  and related litigation costs legal liabilities that would be in excess of amounts accrued 
based on the information currently available  nstar does not believe that it is probable that any such additional legal liability will have a material impact on its consolidated financial position 
however  it is reasonably possible that additional legal liabilities that may result from changes in estimates could have a material impact on its results of operations for a reporting period 
income tax issues a 
tax valuation allowance sfas prohibits the recognition of all or a portion of deferred income tax benefits if it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
nstar had determined that it was more likely than not that a current or future income tax benefit would not be realized relating to the write downs of its rcn investment that were recorded in the second and fourth quarters of and previously in the first quarter of these write downs resulted from the significant declines in the market value of the telecommunications sector  including rcn 
as a result of this uncertainty  nstar recorded a million tax valuation allowance on the entire tax benefit associated with these write downs 
during  as a result of previously unanticipated capital gain transactions  nstar recognized million of this tax benefit 
additionally  based on the internal revenue service irs review of nstar s and federal income tax returns  nstar determined that it was more likely than not that it would ultimately recognize the tax benefits relating to the incremental operating losses from the joint venture 
the returns are currently being audited by the irs as part of their normal review of nstar s consolidated federal income tax returns 
the tax valuation allowance included reserves relating to the tax treatment of these losses through june  each of the tax returns filed for through claimed operating losses 
the return to be filed for will also claim the remaining portion of these operating losses 
the issues involving the operating loss deductions recorded on the tax returns for the years and are substantially similar to those that had concerned nstar regarding the tax treatment of that item on the and returns 
based on the irs examining agent s current review  no adjustment for the years under audit is proposed 
a determination of this issue was arrived at in the fourth quarter of and  as a result  nstar applied the treatment of these operating losses for all years on a consistent basis  allowing a reduction to its valuation allowance of approximately million as a net credit to income tax expense included as a component of the write down 
nstar has and will continue to research potential transactions that improve the operational efficiencies of nstar while maximizing the utilization of these potential tax benefits 
should nstar be successful in its tax and operational planning to allow a portion of the remaining tax benefit to be ultimately realized  nstar will reflect a credit to its income tax expense 
future earnings could be positively impacted by the outcome of this strategy 
the maximum potential positive future earnings impact is currently estimated at million 
management is currently unable to determine when  whether  or the extent to which nstar will be able to recognize this potential benefit 
b 
tax gain on generating assets the cost of transitioning to retail open access was mitigated  in part  by the sale of commonwealth energy system s com energy now a wholly owned subsidiary of nstar non nuclear generating assets 
com energy completed the sale of substantially all of its non nuclear generating assets in proceeds from the sale of these assets amounted to approximately million  or times their book value of approximately million 
the proceeds from the sale  net of book value  transaction costs and certain other adjustments amounted to million and are required to be used for the benefit of com energy customers under mdte rate setting policies 
in this instance  the amount was used to reduce transition costs of cambridge electric and comelectric related to electric industry restructuring 
com energy determined that this transaction was not a taxable event because it did not provide an economic benefit to its shareholders 
the amount  if not for this treatment  that would otherwise have been paid in taxes is approximately million 
should com energy ultimately lose this issue  tax deductions resulting in tax savings of approximately million would be realized by com energy over a period of years 
during the second quarter of  nstar was notified that the irs intended to file a request for technical advice with the irs national office with regard to com energy s tax treatment of this item 
as of december   the request for technical advice had not yet been filed 
the irs is in the process of completing its audit of com energy s tax returns for the years  and the audit will not be closed at the examination level until the issue described above has been resolved either by the irs closing the audit with no adjustment for the item or by providing com energy with a tax deficiency notice 
should com energy be issued a deficiency notice it must then decide to either contest the notice at irs appellate or in a court of law or concede the issue 
it is expected that once the request for technical advice is filed  a national office decision would be made within two months 
should nstar s position be challenged  it is probable that nstar will make a tax payment of approximately million in order to stop the accrual of interest on the potential remaining tax deficiency for all years involved through nstar intends to vigorously defend its position  which is supported by an opinion from an independent tax advisor  relative to this transaction and anticipates pursuing a refund of any amounts paid plus interest 
in addition  nstar would pursue regulatory rate recovery for the interest on tax deficiencies should any amounts ultimately be incurred as a result of this transaction 
the mdte has provided written acknowledgements to nstar indicating its understanding of the issue  and com energy s ability to seek recovery of costs relating to the tax deficiency that may be incurred 
nstar believes that recovery from customers is probable in view of the mdte s position and its understanding of the monetary benefits to be realized by com energy s customers should it be successful in defending its position 
however  if nstar is unsuccessful with the irs and unsuccessful in getting favorable regulatory treatment  it is possible that it could have an adverse impact on nstar s results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
results of operations the following section of md a compares the results of operations for each of the three fiscal years ended december   and and should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
compared to nstar s energy delivery businesses continue to be subject to traditional utility accounting and ratemaking principles since nstar earns a regulated equity return on its investments in those businesses 
earnings loss per common share were as follows years ended december  change basic after rcn charge nm before rcn charge diluted after rcn charge nm before rcn charge nm not meaningful management believes that earnings before the rcn charge is a meaningful measure of earnings and is reflective of its internal earnings assessment and controls 
in addition  it is also more representative of nstar s prior and future performance 
earnings were million  or and per basic and diluted common share  respectively  for earnings for were million  or and per basic and diluted common share  respectively  before total non cash  after tax charges of million  or per basic share  related to nstar s investment in rcn corporation rcn that is further discussed below 
for  nstar reported a loss of million or per basic and diluted common share 
results for were million  or per basic and per diluted common share  before a non cash  after tax charge of million  or per basic share  related to nstar s investment in rcn 
absent the rcn charges in both years  earnings increased by million per share  or  primarily due to increased kwh and firm gas sales and transportation and favorable adjustments related to regulatory orders  lower preferred dividend requirements and interest savings offset by higher operations and maintenance expenses 
operations and maintenance reflects higher pension and other postretirement benefits expenses and increased maintenance on the electric system in connection with the system improvement program 
cash flows from operations increased by over million due to the higher level of earnings  improved accounts receivable collections  lower regulatory cost deferrals  and income tax payments 
other positive factors during the current year included lower bad debt expense of million and a million deferred tax benefit resulting from an adjustment to nstar s tax valuation allowance 
nstar s return on equity was despite the downturn in the current economic environment 
nstar and subsidiaries maintained their credit ratings with all rating agencies 
in addition  nstar increased its common dividend rate by or per share to on an annual basis 
capital spending in significantly exceeded the prior year s level due to an increase in the allocation of critical capital resources to improve electric system reliability and customer service 
as an indication of this progress  key electric and gas operating performance results were greatly improved in over those of electric customer outage hours were reduced by and the length of those outages was reduced by 
these dramatic improvements were accomplished during record breaking summer heat and an unprecedented demand for electricity 
also contributing to this increase was additional capital spending related to nstar s non regulated subsidiaries  primarily advanced energy systems generation expansion project 
on june   nstar received an additional million shares from the third and final exchange of its investment in the rcn joint venture pursuant to an amended joint venture agreement 
the market value of rcn common shares continued to decline during and did not close above nstar s previously adjusted carrying value of per share since november  as a result  nstar recognized impairment charges totaling million  reducing the carrying value of its million rcn shares to per share as of december  these charges were offset by the recognition of million in tax benefits relating to joint venture operating losses 
combined  the impairment charges and tax benefits amounted to million  or per share in similarly  in  due to a significant decrease in the market value of rcn common shares  nstar recorded a non cash  after tax charge of million 
management determined that these declines in market value were other than temporary in accordance with sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
operating revenues operating revenues for decreased from as follows in thousands retail electric revenues  wholesale electric revenues  gas sales revenues  other revenues  decrease in operating revenues  the decrease in operating revenues was significantly impacted by the decline in standard offer and default service rates charged to customers beginning in january that reflected lower purchased power and gas costs 
retail electric revenues were  million in compared to  million in  a decrease of million  or 
the change in retail revenues includes the significantly lower cost of purchased energy supply discussed below that contributed to the lower rates implemented in january  april and july for standard offer and default services 
components of the total decrease in retail revenues includes lower revenues attributable to standard offer and default services of million and million  respectively  lower revenue related to demand side management and renewable energy programs of million due to the reconciliation of program costs  an increase in incentive adjustments and the timing of program expenditures 
transition revenues increased by million due to higher rates for transition cost recovery offset by an million decline in mitigation incentive revenues that are allowed for successfully lowering transition charges 
mitigation incentive revenues will continue to decrease over the transition period extending over time from through transmission revenues increased by million primarily as a result of rate increases and the absence in of a million reduction in revenues that reflected an mdte approved transmission reconciliation filing 
the change in nstar s retail revenues related to standard offer  default services and demand side management and renewable energy are reconciled to the costs incurred 
the increase in retail kwh sales in reflects  by customer sectors  an improvement of in residential and in commercial offset somewhat by the continued sales decline of in the industrial sector 
the overall increase in sales is attributable to the warmer summer period  as compared to the prior year 
was the tenth warmest year in years 
however  the economic downturn continues to have an negative impact on sales as indicated by the high boston office vacancy rate 
business spending continues to be depressed as firms appear reluctant to commit to increased employment and expansion of office space 
the unemployment rate in boston was approximately through december as compared to approximately in the same period last year 
nstar electric s sales to residential and commercial customers were approximately and  respectively  of its total retail sales mix for and provided and of total revenues  respectively 
industrial sales declined due primarily to a slowdown in economic conditions that led to reduced production or facility closings 
the industrial and other retail sales sector comprises approximately of nstar s energy sales and of distribution revenue 
nstar forecasts its electric and gas sales based on normal weather conditions 
actual results may differ from those projected due to actual weather conditions above or below these normal weather levels 
due to a challenging economic environment ahead  unit sales of electricity in are expected to grow at approximately 
weather conditions greatly impact the change in electric sales and  to a greater extent  gas sales and revenues in nstar s service area 
the first quarter of was significantly warmer than the same period in  followed by slightly below normal temperatures for the second quarter  above normal temperatures in the third quarter and colder than prior year and normal conditions in the fourth quarter of below is comparative information on heating and cooling degree days for and and the number of degree days in a normal year as represented by a year average 
a degree day is a unit measuring how much the outdoor mean temperature falls below for heating or rises above for cooling a base of degrees 
each degree below or above the base  is measured in one degree day 
normal year average heating degree days    percentage change from prior year percentage change from year average cooling degree days percentage change from prior year percentage change from year average the heating degree days experienced during were virtually the same level with heating degree days in however  in the first quarter of  heating degree days totaled  a decline of from the prior year of  and below a normal level of  heating degree days for the fourth quarter were  an increase of as compared to and greater than normal 
the warmer than normal conditions in early significantly impacted earnings for gas operations due to the relatively short winter period when there is potential heating demand 
the higher cooling degree days experienced during positively impacted electric distribution revenues 
the above normal cooling degree days impacted air conditioning usage of our customers and resulted in higher electric distribution revenues than would otherwise have been recorded during a more moderate summer period 
wholesale electric revenues were million in compared to million in  a decrease of million  or 
this decrease in wholesale revenues reflects the expiration of two municipal power supply contracts on may   and another municipal contract on october   and a decline in rates due to the lower cost of purchased power 
after october   nstar will no longer have contracts for the supply of wholesale power 
amounts collected from wholesale customers are credited to retail customers through the transition charge 
therefore  the expiration of these contracts has no impact on results of operations 
in  wholesale electric sales are forecasted to decrease due to the expiration of contracts with several municipalities 
gas sales revenues were million in compared to million in  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease in revenues is primarily attributable to a decline in the cost of gas from suppliers compared to the same period last year  slightly offset by a increase in firm unit sales 
other revenues were million in compared to million in  a decrease of million  or 
this decrease primarily reflects lower revenues from non utility operations due to lower steam sales that reflect warmer weather during the early part of  lower billing rates  and the loss of a large customer  partially offset by higher chilled water revenues due to the warmer summer period and higher demand rates 
operating expenses purchased power costs were  million in compared to  million in  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease in expense reflects a decline in prices of natural gas and oil and a decrease in wholesale sales due to the expiration of three municipal power supply contracts 
partially offsetting the impact of these decreases was a increase in retail electric sales and an increase in transmission costs 
included in and was million and million  respectively  that related to the recognition of previously deferred standard offer and default service supply costs resulting from the current period collection of previously deferred costs 
nstar adjusts its electric rates to collect the costs related to energy supply from customers on a reconciling basis 
due to the rate adjustment mechanism  a change in the amount of energy supply expense does not have an impact on earnings 
nstar electric satisfied most of its standard offer service through existing long term power purchase agreements that were assigned to an independent party  and entered into shorter term agreements for the remaining requirement 
the cost of gas sold  representing nstar gas supply expense  was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million  or  reflecting the lower cost of gas supply and the significant reduction in sales due to milder weather conditions in the first quarter of these expenses are also reconciled to the current level of revenues collected 
operations and maintenance expense was million in compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
this increase primarily reflects incremental expenditures incurred relating to improvements to nstar s electric delivery system that were substantially completed as of september   an increase of approximately million and million in pension related and postretirement benefits expense net of amounts capitalized  respectively  resulting primarily from a downturn in the equity market rates and a million loss incurred that related to an insurance settlement adjustment 
the increase in pension costs and other postretirement benefit costs are anticipated to continue through  as a result of the declines in the equity markets over the past three years 
these factors were somewhat offset by the absence of million in storm costs incurred in the first quarter of and a decline in bad debt expense of million 
in  despite a projected million increase in pension and pbop expense  total operations and maintenance expense is expected to remain flat 
depreciation and amortization expense was million in compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
this increase was primarily due to increases in capital spending during in connection with system reliability improvements as well as the accelerated amortization of regulatory assets associated with the seabrook sale of approximately million 
this increase was offset by the absence of depreciation on nstar s district energy facility  northwind in in northwind s assets were written down by million 
demand side management dsm and renewable energy programs expense was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million  or  primarily due to a reduction of dsm programs which is consistent with the collection of conservation and renewable energy revenues 
these costs are in accordance with program guidelines established by the mdte and are collected from customers on a fully reconciling basis 
in addition  nstar earns revenue incentive amounts in return for increased customer participation 
in and  these incentives amounted to approximately million 
property and other taxes were million in compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
this increase was due to higher tax rates and assessments  particularly for the city of boston of million offset by lower payments in lieu of taxes to the town of plymouth under nstar s agreement with the town 
income taxes from operations were million in compared to million in  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease in income tax expense is primarily the result of tax benefits relating to certain customer refunds  which reduced income tax expense by approximately million 
in addition  this decrease also reflects the tax benefit of deducting nstar s common dividends paid to the nstar savings plan 
these items resulted in a decrease in the effective tax rate for to from for other income  net other income was million in compared to million in  an increase in income of million 
the increase was due primarily to million in accelerated amortization of itc resulting from the sale of seabrook  deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments of million  a million net increase in interest income primarily related to a reversal of a previously established interest reserve and the absence in of million related to system development costs 
other income in also reflects million related to transaction fees 
other deductions  net other deductions were million in both and in deductions in reflect the absence of a million accrual for shutdown costs recorded in for the northwind district energy facility as compared to million in for an additional charge for expected equipment removal costs and a million decline in expense for the minority interest related to this facility 
other deductions also include increased charitable contributions of million  offset by million in lower miscellaneous deductions  including applicable income tax benefits for total other deductions 
interest charges interest on long term debt and transition property securitization certificates was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease in interest expense reflects the retirement of million in boston edison s debentures in august  boston edison s early redemption of debentures of million in september  nstar gas series i bonds of million in december  cambridge electric s series d notes of million in june and comelectric s million term loan in january  additional sinking fund payments and the reduction in transition property securitization certificates outstanding of million that resulted in reduced interest expense of million 
securitization interest represents interest on debt collateralized by the future income stream associated with the stranded costs of the pilgrim unit divestiture 
these certificates are non recourse to boston edison 
partially offsetting these decreases in interest expense was the impact of the october  boston edison issuance of million of year debentures and million of year floating rate debentures in priced at three month libor plus basis points 
the net proceeds were used to repay consolidated outstanding short term debt 
these new debentures increased interest expense by million in short term and other interest expense was million in compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
this increase was due to a million increase in the carrying charges associated with reductions in the level of under collection of regulatory deferrals  particularly carrying charges related to deferred transition costs 
short term and other interest costs reflected a significant reduction in borrowing rates and a million lower average level of debt outstanding in  that resulted in an interest savings of approximately million 
short term borrowing rates averaged approximately in as compared to approximately in partially offsetting this decrease in short term expense was a million increase in interest costs associated for the most part with now resolved tax matters 
the decrease in afudc is primarily due to a reduction in the afudc rate reflecting the overall decline in short term debt rates 
the rate was compared to in also contributing to this decrease was the absence in the current period of capitalized interest on the construction of the summit facility of approximately million 
these reductions were partially offset by higher capital project balances during primarily as a result of electric system infrastructure upgrades 
compared to earnings loss per common share were as follows years ended december  change basic after rcn charge before rcn charge diluted after rcn charge before rcn charge management believes that earnings before the rcn charge is a meaningful measure of earnings and is reflective of its internal earnings assessment and controls 
in addition  it is also more representative of nstar s prior and future performance 
for nstar reported a loss of million or per basic and diluted common share  compared to earnings for of million  or and per basic and diluted common share  respectively 
earnings for were million  or and per basic and diluted common share  respectively  before a non cash  after tax charge of million  or per basic share  recorded in the first quarter related to nstar s investment in rcn 
factors that contributed to the million  or  decline in earnings before the non cash  after tax charge included a decline in firm gas sales in bbtu of  a refund of million to electric customers in conjunction with nstar s service quality plan  the accrual of costs associated with the shutdown of northwind s district energy facility of million and a decline in the return on equity on the plant investment base of the seabrook facility 
positive factors included a slight increase in retail kwh sales of  a lower regulatory interest expense adjustment due to a reconciliation filing of deferred standard offer and default service costs that resulted in additional interest expense recorded in  a settlement of revenues due nstar from a former pilgrim unit customer and a one time gain associated with the receipt of equity securities issued in conjunction with the demutualization of two mutual insurance companies that provide coverage to nstar subsidiaries 
for  a decrease of approximately million average common shares outstanding that resulted from the repurchase of shares during had a positive impact on earnings per share of approximately as of december   nstar finalized the process of converting its joint venture investment in rcn into shares of rcn common stock 
nstar s investment in rcn included million common shares that it held at that time and million common shares that were ultimately received in june for its remaining interest in the joint venture 
consistent with the performance of the telecommunications sector as a whole  the market value of rcn s common shares decreased significantly during the latter part of and continued in as a result  nstar recognized an impairment of its investment in rcn in the first quarter of per sfas operating revenues operating revenues for increased from as follows in thousands retail electric revenues  wholesale electric revenues  gas sales revenues  other revenues  increase in operating revenues  retail electric revenues were  million in compared to  million in  an increase of million  or 
the change in retail revenues included a increase in retail kwh sales  higher rates implemented in january and july for standard offer and default services  which increased retail revenues by million and million  respectively and the absence in of a million fuel charge refund to customers in these revenue increases were partially offset by lower transition revenues of million due to a decline in rates  a decline in transmission revenues of million and a decline of million for demand side management and other revenues 
the increase in nstar s retail revenues related to standard offer and default services are fully reconciled to the costs incurred and have no impact on net income 
the increase in retail kwh sales primarily reflected growth in the residential and commercial sectors of and  respectively 
nstar electric s sales to residential and commercial customers were approximately and  respectively  of its total retail sales mix for and provided and of distribution revenue  respectively 
industrial sector sales declined due primarily to a slowdown in economic conditions that resulted from reduced production or facility closings 
the industrial sector comprises approximately of nstar s energy sales and of distribution revenue 
the summer period of was significantly warmer than the same period in  and this abnormal pattern continued into the fourth quarter heating season of with above normal temperatures

year average heating degree days    percentage change from prior year percentage change from year average cooling degree days percentage change from prior year percentage change from year average wholesale electric revenues were million in compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
this increase in wholesale revenues primarily reflected increased demand from a public transit authority and municipal contracts 
gas sales revenues were million in compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to the recovery of increased gas costs  partially offset by an decline in firm sales and transportation due to the impact of the economic slowdown on the commercial and industrial sectors 
this was the case during the fourth quarter of when firm gas sales declined from the prior year and were significantly impacted by the decline in heating degree days 
as indicated above  heating degree days in were below and below normal and contributed to the decrease in firm sales and transportation 
nstar gas firm bbtu sales to residential and commercial customers were approximately and  respectively  of total firm sales 
other revenues were million in compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
this change reflected higher iso new england related transmission revenues and higher revenues realized from district energy operations 
operating expenses purchased power and cost of gas sold expense was  million in  compared to  million in  an increase of million  or 
the purchased power component of these costs was  million in compared to  million in  an increase of million  or 
the increase in purchased power expense reflected the impact of the recognition of previously deferred standard offer and default service supply costs resulting from collection of these costs in also impacting this increase were increases in purchased power requirements due to a increase in retail sales and a increase in wholesale sales  partially offset by lower costs that reflect the prices of natural gas and oil 
further contributing to the increase in total expense was the cost of gas sold  representing nstar gas supply expense  which was million for compared to million in  an increase of million  or  due primarily to the higher gas supply costs in these expenses are also fully reconciled to the current level of revenues collected 
operations and maintenance expense was million in compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
this slight increase reflected higher electric distribution weather related maintenance costs related to a major late winter storm in march and severe summer weather during and higher maintenance costs incurred in connection with nstar s unregulated subsidiary activities 
other factors that increased expenses were higher bad debt expense primarily due to the increased sales and higher costs related to postretirement and other benefits 
offsetting this increase was the absence of non recurring computer system implementations costs incurred during depreciation and amortization expense was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million  or 
the decrease primarily reflected the buy down of the seabrook investment in november utilizing the majority of the proceeds from the sale of canal s generating units 
further contributing to this decrease was the write down of the remaining assets of the northwind district energy facility in and decreased amortization of software related costs  partially offset by a slightly higher level of system wide depreciable plant in service 
dsm and renewable energy programs expense was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million  or  primarily due to timing of dsm expense 
these costs are in accordance with program guidelines established by regulators and are collected from customers on a fully reconciling basis 
in addition  nstar earns incentive amounts in return for increased customer participation 
property and other taxes were million in compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
the increase was due to the fact that during  boston edison was reimbursed for the majority of its payments in lieu of property taxes to the town of plymouth by entergy 
entergy purchased the pilgrim unit from boston edison in income taxes from operations were million in compared to million in  a decrease of million  or  reflecting the impact of lower pre tax operating income 
other income  net other income was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million 
the decrease was due to a million reduction in the settlement of claims primarily related to the pilgrim wholesale contract buyout and a million net reduction in other miscellaneous income items and taxes related to other income  recognized in offsetting these declines in other income was the impact of million of income associated with the receipt of common stock in connection with the demutualization of two insurance companies  recognized in other deductions  net other deduction items were million in compared to income of million in  an increase in deductions of million due primarily to the million recognition in  for the accrual of costs associated with the shutdown of the northwind unregulated district energy facility  offset by a million net increase in other miscellaneous income items  primarily minority interest adjustment  and income tax related to other deductions 
interest charges interest on long term debt and transition property securitization certificates was million in compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
this change in long term interest costs included million that reflected a full year of debt outstanding from the issuance of million and million of nstar notes in february and october of  respectively  offset somewhat by a decrease of million that reflected the retirement of million in boston edison debt and the pay down of other subsidiary company debt of million throughout as compared to retirements and pay downs in of million and million  respectively 
long term debt interest in also reflected a reduction of securitization certificates interest of million due to the partial retirement of this debt 
interest on short term and other obligations was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million  or 
this decrease was primarily due to a reconciliation adjustment of regulatory deferrals in conjunction with an mdte reconciliation that resulted in the recognition of interest expense in  and the positive impact of approximately million resulting from lower interest rates that included the impact of higher average short term borrowing levels from banks 
the increase in borrowing was primarily the result of financing long term debt and preferred stock retirements with short term borrowing and other working capital requirements 
further contributing to the lower interest expense in was an offset to previously accrued interest expense on internal revenue service tax matters that were settled in liquidity and capital resources during  and  internal generation of cash provided  and  respectively  of plant expenditures 
internally generated funds consist of cash flows from operating activities  adjusted to exclude changes in working capital and the payment of dividends 
nstar companies supplement internally generated funds as needed  primarily through the issuance of short term commercial paper and bank borrowings 
the capital spending level forecasted for is million  consisting of approximately million for electric and gas operations and million for capital requirements of non utility ventures 
the capital spending level over the following four years is forecasted to aggregate approximately million 
management continuously reviews its capital expenditure and financing programs 
these programs and  therefore  the estimates included in this form k are subject to revision due to changes in regulatory requirements  operating requirements  environmental standards  availability and cost of capital  interest rates and other assumptions 
nstar has long term debt principal payments  minimum lease commitments  electric capacity charge obligations under contracts and natural gas contractual agreements at december   for each of the years presented below years in millions thereafter long term debt  transition property securitization leases electric capacity obligations gas contractual obligations nstar s short term debt decreased by million to million at december  as compared to million at december  the decrease resulted primarily from the use of proceeds from boston edison s million financing described below that was completed on october  in addition  sources of cash from operating activities provided million 
of cash this source of cash was used to fund nstar s investing activities of million 
the net cash provided by operating activities of million was partially attributable to net earnings of million  which  when adjusted for depreciation and amortization  deferred income taxes and investment tax credits  provided million of operating cash as compared to million in the million change in deferred income taxes and investment tax credits primarily reflects the deferred tax impact of changes in regulatory deferrals year to year and the impact of adjustments to the tax valuation account 
in addition  a change in the tax laws that allows for an additional acceleration of tax depreciation on current year additions  as well as the impact of accelerated depreciation on normal capital additions resulted in approximately million in deferred income tax expense 
correspondingly  these items significantly impact the level of required estimated federal and state income tax payments 
for the year  approximately million was paid for income taxes as compared to million in also contributing to operating cash was a decrease in receivables of million  and an increase in payables of million 
included in the decrease in receivables was the receipt of million associated with the non recurring construction financing of nstar s new corporate office building 
in  nstar funded the construction of this facility 
net working capital  excluding short term borrowings and the current portion of long term debt  increased by million to million for as compared to a shortfall of million for this increase is primarily due to the improved accounts receivable collection activity  lower power supply payments to vendors and a reduction in estimated income tax payments in of approximately million that represent the impact of timing differences on current income tax expense described under the caption of deferred income taxes 
refer to the recent change in tax laws noted above 
the net cash used in investing activities of million was utilized primarily for capital expenditures related to transmission and distribution systems and included million expended on nstar s corporate office facility 
the net cash used in financing activities of million was primarily the result of repayments of short term borrowings of million  long term debt redemptions and sinking fund payments of million and dividends paid of million 
nstar s primary estimated future uses of cash for include capital expenditures  dividend payments and debt reductions 
the irs is in the process of completing its audit of com energy s tax returns for the years  and before completion of these audits  and before the end of the second quarter of  it is expected that the irs national office will provide a response to a request for technical advice to be filed by the irs examining agents 
should nstar s position be challenged as a result of the irs request for technical advice  it is probable that nstar will make a payment to the irs of approximately million in order to stop the accrual of interest on the potential tax deficiency 
nstar intends to vigorously defend its position  which is supported by an opinion from an independent tax advisor  relative to this transaction and anticipates pursuing a refund of the amount paid plus interest 
refer to income tax issues in this md a for additional information 
for  actual capital spending was approximately million including the system improvement program that was essentially complete as of september   million in connection with a new corporate office building  customer growth projects incurred by nstar gas and expenditures in connection with advanced energy systems generation expansion project 
in order to continue to deliver the highest possible service levels to customers  capital investments in are expected to be approximately million

nstar and its subsidiary companies debt credit ratings services are provided by moody s investors service  standard poor s rating services and fitch ratings 
all ratings carry a stable outlook and are as follows moody s s p fitch nstar a a a boston edison company a a aa commonwealth electric company not rated a a cambridge electric light company not rated a a nstar gas company not rated a a historically  nstar and its subsidiaries have had a variety of external sources of financing available  as indicated above  at favorable rates and terms to finance its external cash requirements 
however  the availability of such financing at favorable rates and terms depends heavily upon prevailing market conditions and nstar s or its subsidiaries financial condition and credit ratings 
during  all of nstar s debt credit rating agencies listed above reaffirmed their ratings of nstar and its subsidiaries 
an adverse change in nstar s or its subsidiaries credit ratings or market conditions could have an adverse impact on the terms and conditions upon which nstar or its subsidiaries have access to capital markets 
nstar has no provisions in financial guarantees  commitments  debt or lease agreements that affirm that a change in its credit rating would trigger a change in terms and conditions  such as acceleration of payment obligations 
however  nstar s subsidiaries could be required to provide additional security for power supply contract performance  such as a letter of credit for their pro rata share of the remaining value of such contracts 
refer to performance assurances from electricity and gas supply agreements and financial and performance guarantees further discussed below 
nstar s goal is to maintain a capital structure that preserves an appropriate balance between debt and equity 
management believes its liquidity and capital resources are sufficient to meet its current and projected requirements 
performance assurances from electricity and gas supply agreements nstar electric has entered into a series of purchased power agreements to meet its default and standard offer service supply obligations through december  these agreements are generally for a term of six to twelve months 
nstar electric currently is recovering payments it is making to suppliers from its customers 
most of nstar electric s power suppliers are subsidiaries of larger companies with investment grade or better credit ratings 
nstar has financial assurances and guarantees that include letters of credit in place with the parent company of the supplier  to minimize nstar electric risk in the event the supplier encounters financial difficulties or otherwise fails to perform 
in addition  under these agreements  in the event that the supplier or its parent guarantor fails to maintain an investment grade credit rating  it is required to provide additional security for performance of its obligations 
nstar electric s policy is to enter into power supply arrangements only if the supplier or its parent guarantor has an investment grade or better credit rating 
in view of current volatility in the energy supply industry  nstar electric is unable to determine whether its suppliers or their parent guarantors will become subject to financial difficulties  or whether these financial assurances and guarantees are sufficient 
in the event  the supplier or its guarantor may not be in a position to provide the required additional security  nstar electric may then terminate the agreement 
some of these agreements include a reciprocal provision  where in the event that an nstar electric distribution company receives a credit rating below investment grade  that company could be required to provide additional security for performance  such as a letter of credit 
virtually all of nstar gas firm gas supply agreements are short term less than one year and utilize market based  monthly indexed pricing mechanisms so the financial risk to the company would be minimal if a supplier were to fail to perform 
however  in the event that a firm supplier does fail to perform under its firm gas supply agreement pricing provisions  the company would be entitled to any positive difference between the monthly supply price and the cost of replacement supplies 
the cost of gas procured for firm gas sales customers is recovered through a regulatory semi annual cost of gas adjustment mechanism 
under mdte regulations  interim adjustments to the cost of gas may also be requested if market volatility causes swings in the price of gas 
nstar gas continually evaluates the financial stability of current and prospective gas suppliers 
firm suppliers are required to have and maintain investment grade credit ratings and the firm gas supply agreements allow either party to require financial assurances  or  if necessary  contract termination in the event that either party is downgraded below investment level 
financial and performance guarantees on a limited basis  nstar and certain of its subsidiaries may enter into agreements providing financial assurance to third parties 
such agreements include letters of credit  surety bonds  and other guarantees 
at december   outstanding guarantees totaled million as follows in thousands letters of credit  surety bonds  other guarantees  total guarantees  the million letter of credit is for the benefit of a third party  as trustee in connection with the notes of one of its subsidiaries 
the letter of credit is available if its subsidiary has insufficient funds to pay the debt service requirements 
as of december   there have been no amounts drawn under this letter of credit 
at december   certain of nstar s subsidiaries have purchased a total of million of performance surety bonds for the purpose of obtaining licenses  permits and rights of way in various municipalities 
in addition  nstar has purchased approximately million in worker s compensation self insurer bonds 
these bonds support the guarantee by nstar to the commonwealth of massachusetts required as part of nstar s worker s compensation self insurance program 
nstar and its subsidiaries have also issued million of residual value guarantees related to its equity interest in the hydro quebec transmission companies 
management believes the likelihood nstar would be required to perform or otherwise incur any significant losses associated with any of these guarantees is remote 
preferred stock dividends and redemptions preferred dividends of boston edison were approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
on december   boston edison redeemed all  shares outstanding of its cumulative preferred stock  series  at the mandatory redemption price of per share  plus accrued dividends from november  to december  contingencies environmental matters as of december   nstar s subsidiaries were involved in state regulated properties massachusetts contingency plan  or mcp sites where oil or other hazardous materials were previously spilled or released 
on february   nstar closed out one of these sites and filed the required information with the massachusetts department of environmental protection 
the nstar subsidiaries are required to clean up or otherwise remediate these properties in accordance with specific state regulations 
there are uncertainties associated with the remediation costs due to the final selection of the specific cleanup technology and the particular characteristics of the different sites 
in addition to the mcp sites  nstar subsidiaries also face possible liability as a result of involvement in multi party disposal sites or third party claims associated with contamination remediation 
nstar generally expects to have only a small percentage of the total potential liability for these sites 
estimates of approximately million and million are included as liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at december  and  respectively  and are the total amount of nstar s estimated environmental clean up obligations 
accordingly  this amount has not been reduced by any potential rate recovery treatment of these costs or any potential recovery from nstar s insurance carriers 
prospectively  should nstar be allowed regulatory rate recovery of these specific costs  it would record an offsetting regulatory asset and record a credit to operating expenses equal to previously expensed costs 
based on its assessments of the specific site circumstances  management does not believe that it is probable that any such additional costs will have a material impact on nstar s consolidated financial position 
nstar gas is participating in the assessment of six former manufactured gas plant mgp sites and alleged mgp waste disposal locations to determine if and to what extent such sites have been contaminated and whether nstar gas may be responsible for remedial action 
the mdte has approved recovery of costs associated with mgp sites over a year period  without carrying costs 
as of december  and  nstar gas has recorded a liability of million and million  respectively  as an estimate for site cleanup costs for several mgp sites for which nstar gas was previously cited as a potentially responsible party 
a corresponding regulatory asset has been recorded that reflects the future rate recovery for these costs 
estimates related to environmental remediation costs are reviewed and adjusted periodically as further investigation and assignment of responsibility occurs and as either additional sites are identified or nstar s responsibilities for such sites evolve or are resolved 
nstar s ultimate liability for future environmental remediation costs may vary from these estimates 
although  in view of nstar s current assessment of its environmental responsibilities  existing legal requirements and regulatory policies  management does not believe that these matters will have a material adverse effect on nstar s consolidated financial position or results of operations for a reporting period 
employees and employee relations as of december   nstar had approximately  employees  including approximately  or of whom are represented by three collective bargaining units covered by separate contracts 
local of the utility workers union of america  afl cio  represents approximately  employees with a five year contract that expires on may  a collective bargaining unit contract representing approximately employees expired on march  on march   local  united steelworkers of america  afl cio clc  ratified a new four year contract that expires on march  approximately employees of advanced energy systems matep subsidiary are represented by the local  international union of operating engineers  afl cio  through a labor agreement that expires on september  management believes it has satisfactory relations with its employees 
interest rate risk nstar is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily based on levels of short term debt outstanding 
the weighted average interest rates for long term indebtedness  including current maturities were and in and  respectively 
carrying amounts and fair values of long term indebtedness excluding notes payable  including current maturities as of december  and  were as follows carrying fair carrying fair in thousands amount value amount value long term indebtedness     item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk although nstar has material commodity purchase contracts  these instruments are not subject to market risk 
nstar s electric and gas distribution subsidiaries have rate making mechanisms that allow for the recovery of fuel costs from customers 
customers have the option of continuing to buy power from the retail electric distribution businesses at standard offer prices through february the cost of providing standard offer service includes fuel and purchased power costs 
default service is the electricity that is supplied by the local distribution company when a customer is not receiving power from standard offer service 
the market prices for standard offer and default service will fluctuate based on the average market price for power 
amounts collected through standard offer and default service are recovered on a fully reconciling basis 
on october   boston edison issued million of year floating rate debentures priced at libor plus basis points 
an immediate change of one percent for these variable rate debentures would cause a change in interest expense of approximately million per year
