effects of inflation and changing prices the company s results of operations and financial condition have not been significantly affected by inflation and changing prices 
the company has been able  subject to normal competitive conditions  to pass along rising costs through increased selling prices 
there can be no assurances  however  that the company will continue to be able to pass along rising costs through increased selling prices 
critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements located in item of this annual report on form k 
however  certain of the company s accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of the company s financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by the company s management  as a result they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
in applying those policies  the company s management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
those estimates are based on the company s historical experience  the company s observance of trends in the industry  information provided by the company s customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
on an ongoing basis  the company reviews its estimates to ensure that they appropriately reflect changes in the company s business 
the company s critical accounting policies include accounting for promotional activities 
gross sales reflect reductions attributable to consideration given to customers in various customer incentive programs  including pricing discounts on single transactions  volume discounts  promotional and advertising allowances  coupons  and rebates 
certain customer incentive programs require management to estimate the cost of those programs 
the accrued liability for these programs is determined through analysis of programs offered  historical trends  expectations regarding customer and consumer participation  sales and payment trends  and experience with payment patterns associated with similar programs that had been previously offered 
if assumptions included in the company s estimates were to change or market conditions were to change  then material incremental reductions to revenue could be required  which would have a material adverse impact on the company s financial statements 
promotional costs were million  million and million for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
inventory valuation 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on the first in  first out method 
the company assesses the valuation of its inventories and reduces the carrying value of those inventories that are obsolete or in excess of the company s forecasted usage to their estimated net realizable value 
the company estimates the net realizable value of such inventories based on analyses and assumptions including  but not limited to  historical usage  future demand and market requirements 
reductions to the carrying value of inventories are recorded in cost of goods sold 
if the future demand for the company s products is less favorable than the company s forecasts  then the value of the inventories may be required to be reduced  which could result in material additional expense to the company and have a material adverse impact on the company s financial statements 
accounting for business combinations 
the acquisition of businesses is an important element of the company s strategy 
under the purchase method  the company is required to record the net assets acquired at the estimated fair value at the date of acquisition 
the determination of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the company s financial statements 
for example  the company s acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets  the value and estimated life of those assets may affect the amount of future period amortization expense for intangible assets with finite lives as well as possible impairment charges that may be incurred 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
intangible assets with indefinite lives consist primarily of trademarks as well as distributor and agency relationships 
the company is required to analyze its goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on an annual basis as well as when events and circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred 
certain factors that may occur and indicate that an impairment exists include  but are not limited to  operating results that are lower than expected and adverse industry or market economic trends 
the impairment testing requires management to estimate the fair value of the assets or reporting unit and record an impairment loss for the excess of the carrying value over the fair value 
the estimate of fair value of the assets is generally determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows 
the estimate of fair value of the reporting unit is generally determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows supplemented by the market approach 
in estimating the fair value  management must make assumptions and projections regarding such items as future cash flows  future revenues  future earnings and other factors 
the assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are generally consistent with the past performance of each reporting unit and other intangible assets and are also consistent with the projections and assumptions that are used in current operating plans 
such assumptions are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record an impairment loss for these assets 
the recording of any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial statements

cautionary information regarding forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of these forward looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  many of which are beyond the company s control  that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in  or implied by  such forward looking statements 
all statements other than statements of historical facts included in this annual report on form k  including the statements under item business and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations regarding the company s business strategy  future financial position  prospects  plans and objectives of management  as well as information concerning expected actions of third parties are forward looking statements 
when used in this annual report on form k  the words anticipate  intend  expect  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements  although not all forward looking statements contain such identifying words 
all forward looking statements speak only as of the date of this annual report on form k 
the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
although the company believes that the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements are reasonable  it can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct 
in addition to the risks and uncertainties of ordinary business operations  important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in  or implied  by the company s forward looking statements contained in this annual report on form k are as follows the company s indebtedness could have a material adverse effect on its financial health 
the company has incurred substantial indebtedness to finance its acquisitions and may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future to finance further acquisitions or for other purposes 
the company s ability to satisfy its financial obligations under the company s indebtedness outstanding from time to time will depend upon the company s future operating performance  which is subject to prevailing economic conditions  levels of interest rates and financial  business and other factors  many of which are beyond the company s control 
therefore  there can be no assurance that the company s cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet all of its debt service requirements and to fund its capital expenditure requirements 
the company s current and future debt service obligations and covenants could have important consequences 
such consequences include  or may include  the following the company s ability to obtain financing for future working capital needs or acquisitions or other purposes may be limited  a significant portion of the company s cash flow from operations will be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on its indebtedness  thereby reducing funds available for operations  expansion or distributions  the company is subject to restrictive covenants that could limit its ability to conduct its business  and the company may be more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions than less leveraged competitors and  thus  may be limited in its ability to withstand competitive pressures 
the restrictive covenants included in the company s senior credit facility  its bridge loan agreement and its indentures include  among others  restrictions in relation to additional borrowings  the sale of assets  changes of control  the payment of dividends  transactions with affiliates  the making of investments and certain other fundamental changes 
the senior credit facility and the bridge loan agreement also contain restrictions on acquisitions and certain financial ratio tests including a debt coverage ratio  a senior debt coverage ratio  a fixed charges ratio and an interest coverage ratio 
these restrictions could limit the company s ability to conduct business 
a failure to comply with the obligations contained in the senior credit facility  the bridge loan agreement  its indentures or in follow on financings could result in an event of default under such agreements  which could require the company to immediately repay the related debt and also debt under other agreements that may contain cross acceleration or cross default provisions 
the company s acquisition or joint venture strategies may not be successful 
the company has made a number of mergers and acquisitions  including the recent acquisitions of hardy  ravenswood  the turner road vintners assets  and the corus assets  and anticipates that it may  from time to time  acquire additional businesses  assets or securities of companies that the company believes would provide a strategic fit with its business 
in addition  the company has entered joint ventures and may enter into additional joint ventures 
acquired businesses will need to be integrated with the company s existing operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will effectively assimilate the business or product offerings of acquired companies into its business or product offerings 
acquisitions are accompanied by risks such as potential exposure to unknown liabilities of acquired companies and the possible loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business 
acquisitions are subject to risks associated with the difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies  the potential disruption to the company s business and the diversion of management time and attention 
the company shares control of its existing joint ventures and may not have majority interest or control of future joint ventures  and  therefore  there is the risk that the company s joint venture partners may at any time have economic  business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with those of the joint venture or the company 
there is also risk that the company s joint venture partners may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and that the company may be required to fulfill those obligations alone 
the company s failure or the failure of an entity in which the company has a joint venture interest to adequately manage the risks associated with any acquisitions or joint ventures could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
competition could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company is in a highly competitive industry and the dollar amount and unit volume of its sales could be negatively affected by its inability to maintain or increase prices  changes in geographic or product mix  a general decline in beverage alcohol consumption or the decision of the company s wholesale customers  retailers or consumers to purchase competitive products instead of the company s products 
wholesaler  retailer and consumer purchasing decisions are influenced by  among other things  the perceived absolute or relative overall value of the company s products  including their quality or pricing  compared to competitive products 
unit volume and dollar sales could also be affected by pricing  purchasing  financing  operational  advertising or promotional decisions made by wholesalers and retailers which could affect their supply of  or consumer demand for  the company s products 
the company could also experience higher than expected selling  general and administrative expenses if the company finds it necessary to increase the number of its personnel or advertising or promotional expenditures to maintain its competitive position or for other reasons 
increase in excise taxes and government regulations could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
in the united states  the united kingdom  australia and other countries in which the company operates  the company is subject to imposition of excise taxes and other taxes on beverage alcohol products in varying amounts which have been subject to change 
in addition  the beverage alcohol products industry is subject to extensive regulation by federal  state  local and foreign governmental agencies 
for example  in the united states  the alcohol and tobacco tax and trade bureau of the us department of the treasury and the various state liquor authorities regulate such matters as licensing  trade and pricing practices  permitted and required labeling  advertising and relations with wholesalers and retailers 
certain federal and state regulations also require warning labels and signage 
increases in excise taxes on beverage alcohol products in the united states  the united kingdom or australia  if enacted  could materially and adversely affect the company s financial condition or results of operations 
new or revised regulations or increased licensing fees  requirements or taxes could also have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company relies on the performance of wholesale distributors  major retailers and chains for the success of its business 
in the united states  the company sells its products principally to wholesalers for resale to retail outlets including grocery stores  package liquor stores  club and discount stores and restaurants 
in the united kingdom and australia  the company sells its products principally to wholesalers and directly to major retailers and chains 
the replacement or poor performance of the company s major wholesalers  retailers and chains  or the company s inability to collect accounts receivable from the company s major wholesalers  retailers and chains could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
distribution channels for beverage alcohol products have been consolidating in recent years 
in addition  wholesalers and retailers of the company s products offer products which compete directly with the company s products for retail shelf space and consumer purchases 
accordingly  there is a risk that wholesalers or retailers may give higher priority to products of the company s competitors 
in the future  the company s wholesalers and retailers may not continue to purchase the company s products or provide the company s products with adequate levels of promotional support 
the company s business could be adversely affected by declines in the consumption of products the company sells 
although since there have been modest increases in consumption of beverage alcohol in most of the company s product categories  there have been periods in the past few decades in which there were substantial declines in the overall per capita consumption of beverage alcohol products in the united states and other markets in which the company participates 
a limited or general decline in consumption in one or more of the company s product categories could occur in the future due to a variety of factors  including a general decline or lack of improvement in economic conditions  increased concern about the health consequences of consuming beverage alcohol products and about drinking and driving  a trend toward a healthier diet including lighter  lower calorie beverages such as diet soft drinks  juices and water products  increased activity of anti alcohol consumer groups  and increased federal  state or foreign excise taxes 
the company generally purchases raw materials under short term supply contracts and the company is subject to substantial price fluctuations for grapes and grape related materials  the company has a limited group of suppliers of glass bottles 
the company s business is heavily dependent upon raw materials  such as grapes  grape juice concentrate  grains  alcohol and packaging materials from third party suppliers 
the company could experience raw material supply  production or shipment difficulties that could adversely affect the company s ability to supply goods to its customers 
the company is also directly affected by increases in the costs of such raw materials 
in the past  the company has experienced dramatic increases in the cost of grapes 
although the company believes it has adequate sources of grape supplies  in the event demand for certain wine products exceeds expectations  the company could experience shortages 
in addition  one of the company s largest components of cost of goods sold is that of glass bottles  which  in the united states and australia  have only a small number of producers 
currently  substantially all of the company s glass container requirements for its united states operations are supplied by one producer and substantially all of the company s glass container requirements for its australian operations are supplied by another producer 
the inability of any of the company s glass bottle suppliers to satisfy its requirements could adversely affect the company s business 
the company s global operations subject it to risks related to currency rate fluctuations and geopolitical uncertainty 
the company has operations in different countries and  therefore  is subject to the risks associated with currency fluctuations 
subsequent to the hardy acquisition  the company s exposure to foreign currency risk has increased significantly as a result of having additional international subsidiaries in australia  new zealand and france 
the company could experience changes in its ability to obtain or hedge against fluctuations in exchange rates 
the company could also be affected by nationalizations or unstable governments or legal systems or intergovernmental disputes 
these currency  economic and political uncertainties may affect the company s results  especially to the extent these matters  or the decisions  policies or economic strength of the company s suppliers  affect the company s global operations or imported beer products 
the company has a material amount of goodwill  and if the company is required to write down goodwill due to impairment  it would reduce the company s net income  which in turn could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations 
as of february   goodwill represented approximately million  or of the company s total assets 
it is expected that this balance will increase once the allocation of the purchase price for the hardy acquisition is completed 
goodwill is the amount by which the costs of an acquisition accounted for using the purchase method exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired 
the company adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  in its entirety  on march  under sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer amortized  but instead is subject to a periodic impairment evaluation based on the fair value of the reporting unit 
reductions in the company s net income caused by a write down of goodwill could materially and adversely affect the company s results of operations 
the termination or non renewal of imported beer distribution agreements could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
all of the company s imported beer products are marketed and sold pursuant to exclusive distribution agreements with the suppliers of these products and are subject to renewal from time to time 
the company s agreements to distribute corona extra and its other mexican beer brands in primarily western us states expires in december and  subject to compliance with certain performance criteria  continued retention of certain personnel and other terms of the agreement  will be automatically renewed for additional terms of five years 
changes in control of the company or its subsidiaries involved in importing the mexican beer brands  or changes in the chief executive officer of such subsidiaries  may be a basis for the supplier  unless it consents to such changes  to terminate the agreement 
the supplier s consent to such changes may not be unreasonably withheld 
prior to their expiration  all of the company s imported beer distribution agreements may be terminated if the company fails to meet certain performance criteria 
the company believes that it is currently in compliance with all of its material imported beer distribution agreements 
from time to time the company has failed  and may in the future fail  to satisfy certain performance criteria in the company s distribution agreements 
it is possible that the company s beer distribution agreements may not be renewed or may be terminated prior to expiration 
the company s prior years financial statements were audited by arthur andersen llp 
the company s consolidated financial statements for the years ended february   and february   were audited by arthur andersen llp  independent public accountants 
on august   arthur andersen llp ceased to practice before the sec 
therefore  arthur andersen did not participate in the preparation of this form k  did not reissue its audit report with respect to the financial statements included in this form k  and did not consent to the inclusion of a copy of its previously issued audit report in this form k 
as a result  holders of the company s securities may have no effective remedy against arthur andersen llp in connection with a material misstatement or omission in the financial statements to which its audit report relates 
in addition  even if such holders were able to assert such a claim  because it has ceased operations  arthur andersen llp may fail or otherwise have insufficient assets to satisfy claims made by holders of the company s securities that might arise under federal securities laws or otherwise with respect to the audit report of arthur andersen llp 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
to manage the volatility relating to these risks  the company periodically enters into derivative transactions including foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate swap agreements 
the company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and does not use them for trading purposes 
the company uses derivative instruments solely to reduce the financial impact of these risks 
the fair value of long term debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair value of long term debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the estimated fair value of the company s total long term debt  including current maturities  was  million and  million at february   and february   respectively 
a hypothetical increase from prevailing interest rates at february   and february   would have resulted in a decrease in fair value of fixed interest rate long term debt by million and million  respectively 
also  a hypothetical increase from prevailing interest rates at february   and february   would result in an approximate increase in cash required for interest on variable interest rate debt during the next five fiscal years as follows february  february  n a million million million million million n a the company has on occasion entered into interest rate swap agreements to reduce its exposure to interest rate changes relative to its long term debt 
at february   and february   the company had no interest rate swap agreements outstanding 
at february   the company has exposure to foreign currency risk as a result of having international subsidiaries in the united kingdom and canada 
for the company s operations in the united kingdom  the company uses local currency borrowings to hedge its earnings and cash flow exposure to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
at february   management believes that a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would not result in a material adverse impact on either earnings or cash flow 
the company also has exposure to foreign currency risk as a result of contracts to purchase inventory items that are denominated in various foreign currencies 
in order to reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulting from these contracts  the company periodically enters into foreign exchange hedging agreements 
at february   and february   the potential loss on outstanding foreign exchange hedging agreements from a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates would not be material 
subsequent to the hardy acquisition  the company s exposure to foreign currency risk has increased significantly as a result of having additional international subsidiaries in australia  new zealand and france 
the company also has exposure to foreign currency risk as a result of hardy s significant international sales that are denominated in various foreign currencies 
in order to reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulting from these sales  the company s involvement with derivative financial instruments will increase proportionately
