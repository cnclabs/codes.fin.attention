critical accounting policies note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in the company s annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december   includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of company s consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting standards generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to the allowance for doubtful accounts  revenue reserves  excess and obsolete inventory  impairment of long lived assets  valuation allowance and realization of deferred income taxes  and restructuring reserve 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 
aspect s critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  revenue reserves  allowance for doubtful accounts  accounting for income taxes  excess and obsolete inventory and impairment of long lived assets 
the following is a brief discussion of the critical accounting policies and methods used by the company 
revenue recognition the company derives its revenue primarily from two sources i product revenues  which include software licenses and hardware  and ii service revenues  which include support and maintenance  installation  consulting and training revenue 
the company applies the provisions of statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended by statement of position  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with 
table of contents respect to certain transactions and certain provisions of staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements to all transactions involving the sale of software products and hardware 
the company recognizes revenue from the sale of software licenses and hardware when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
delivery generally occurs when product is delivered to a common carrier 
at the time of the transaction  the company assesses whether the fee associated with its revenue transactions is fixed or determinable and whether collection is probable 
the assessment of whether the fee is fixed or determinable is based partly on the payment terms associated with the transaction and financial strength of the customer 
if a significant portion of a fee is due after its normal payment terms  which are to days from invoice date  the company accounts for the fee as not being fixed or determinable  in which case  the company recognizes revenue as the fees become due 
the company assesses collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
the company does not typically request collateral from its customers 
if the company determines that collection of a fee is not probable  then the company will defer the fee and recognize revenue upon receipt of cash 
for arrangements with multiple elements  the company allocates revenue to each component of the arrangement using the residual value method based on vendor specific objective evidence of the undelivered elements 
this means that the company defers the arrangement fee equivalent to the fair value of the undelivered elements until these elements are delivered 
the fair value of each element is determined based on prices of stand alone sales of these elements to third parties 
a key part of the company s overall strategy is to increase sales through indirect channels such as vars and partnering with sis and tas on the direct sales efforts 
in any sales transaction through a distributor or reseller  the company recognizes revenue when the distributor or reseller sells to the end customer 
the company recognizes revenue for maintenance services ratably over the contract term 
the training and consulting services are billed based on hourly rates  and the company generally recognizes revenue as these services are performed 
however  at the time of entering into a transaction  the company assesses whether any services included within the arrangement are essential to the functionality of other elements of the arrangement 
if services are determined to be essential to other elements of the arrangement  the company recognizes the license  consulting and training revenue using the percentage of completion method 
the company estimates the percentage of completion based on its estimate of the total costs estimated to complete the project as a percentage of the costs incurred to date and the estimated costs to complete 
to date  the amount of revenue recognized under the percentage of completion method has not been significant 
revenue reserves an estimate of the revenue reserve for losses on receivables resulting from customer cancellations or terminations is recorded as a reduction in revenues at the time of the sale 
the revenue reserve is estimated based on an analysis of the historical rate of cancellations or terminations of product and services arrangements 
the accuracy of the estimate is dependent on the rate of future cancellations or terminations being consistent with the historical rate 
if the rate of actual cancellations or terminations is greater than the historical rate  then the revenue reserve may not be sufficient to provide for actual losses 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company s management must make estimates of the uncollectibility of accounts receivable 
management specifically analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million as of december  accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing its consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which the company operates 
this process involves management s estimation of the company s actual current tax exposure 
table of contents together with an assessment of temporary differences resulting from different treatments in tax and accounting of certain items 
these differences result in net deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
the company must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent the company believes that recovery is not likely  the company must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent the company establishes a valuation allowance or adjusts this allowance in a period  the company must include a tax benefit or expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determination of the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
the company has a valuation allowance of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to the company s ability to utilize all of its deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward and research tax credits  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which the company operates and the period over which the deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or the company adjusts these estimates in future periods  the company may need to adjust its valuation allowance which could materially impact its financial position and results of operations 
excess and obsolete inventory the company values inventory at the lower of the actual cost or the current estimated net realizable value of the inventory 
management regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on production and supply requirements 
management s estimates of future production and supply requirements may prove to be inaccurate  in which case inventory may be understated or overstated 
in the future  if the carrying value of the inventory were not realizable  the company would be required to recognize write downs to net realizable value as additional cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
although management makes every effort to ensure the accuracy of its forecast of future production requirements and supply  any unanticipated changes in technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
impairment of long lived assets the company s long lived assets include property and equipment  long term investments  goodwill and other intangible assets 
the fair value of the long term investments is dependent on the performance of the companies in which the company has invested  as well as volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments 
in assessing potential impairment for these investments  the company considers these factors as well as the forecasted financial performance of its investees 
the company records an investment impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
during  the company recognized million of impairment losses related to its long term investments 
as of december   the carrying value of the company s long term investment was  in assessing the recoverability of the company s property and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets  the company must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
in june  the financial accounting standard board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
addresses the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets acquired outside of a business combination and the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
sfas no 
provides that intangible assets with finite useful lives will be amortized and that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will not be amortized  but will rather be tested at least annually for impairment 
the company adopted sfas no 
for its fiscal year beginning january  upon adoption of sfas no 
 the company discontinued the amortization of its recorded goodwill  identified its reporting units based on its current segment reporting structure and allocated all recorded goodwill  as well as other assets and liabilities  to the reporting units 

table of contents the company determined the fair value of its reporting units utilizing discounted cash flow models and relative market multiples for comparable businesses 
the company compared the fair value of each of its reporting units to its carrying value 
this evaluation indicated that an impairment might exist for the company s products reporting unit 
the company then performed step under sfas no 
during the second quarter of and compared the carrying amount of goodwill in the products reporting unit to the implied fair value of the goodwill and determined that an impairment loss existed 
this impairment is primarily attributable to the change in the evaluation criteria for goodwill from an undiscounted cash flow approach  which was previously utilized under the guidance in accounting principle board opinion no 
intangible assets  to the fair value approach  which is stipulated in sfas no 
and the requirement under sfas no 
to evaluate goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level 
a non cash charge totaling million was recorded as a change in accounting principle effective january   to write off the goodwill related to the products segment 
the remaining recorded goodwill for the services segment is million as of december  in the first quarter of  the company will evaluate its remaining goodwill per sfas no 
requirements

 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
addresses the initial recognition and measurement of intangible assets acquired outside of a business combination and the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
sfas no 
provides that intangible assets with finite useful lives be amortized and that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will not be amortized  but will rather be tested at least annually for impairment 
the company adopted sfas no 
for its fiscal year beginning january  upon adoption of sfas no 
 the company discontinued the amortization of its recorded goodwill as of that date  identified its reporting units based on its current segment reporting structure and allocated all recorded goodwill  as well as other assets and liabilities  to the reporting units 
the company determined the fair value of its reporting units utilizing discount cash flow and relative market multiples for comparable businesses 
the company compared the fair value of each of its reporting units to its carrying value 
this evaluation indicated that impairment might exist for the company s products reporting unit 
the company then performed step under sfas no 
and compared the carrying amount of goodwill in the products reporting unit to the implied fair value of the goodwill and determined that an impairment loss existed 
this impairment is primarily attributable to the change in the evaluation criteria for goodwill from an undiscounted cash flow approach  which was previously utilized under the guidance in accounting principle board opinion no 
 to the fair value approach  which is stipulated in sfas no 
and the requirement under sfas no 
to evaluate goodwill impairment at the reporting unit level 
a non cash charge totaling million has been recorded as a change in accounting principle effective january   to write off the goodwill of million in the products segment 
the remaining recorded goodwill for the services segment after this impairment write down is million as of december  in the first quarter of  the company will evaluate its remaining goodwill per sfas no

 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires that the liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred rather than when a commitment is made to an exit or disposal plan 
sfas no 
also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value 
sfas no 
is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  the adoption of sfas could result in the company recognizing future restructuring activities  if any  over a period of time rather than in one reporting period

 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
the company has elected to continue to apply accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees in accounting for its stock compensation plans 
sfas also amends the disclosure provisions of sfas to require prominent 
table of contents disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an entity s accounting policy decision with respect to stock based employee compensation  and requires disclosure about those effects in both annual and interim financial statements 
these disclosure provisions are effective for the company s fiscal year ended december  fasb interpretation no 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees  including loan guarantees such as standby letters of credit 
it also requires that at all times a company issues a guarantee  the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair market value of the obligations it assumes under that guarantee and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of fin apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the company adopted the disclosure provisions of fin effective december   which are provided under product warranties in note to consolidated financial statements 
as of december   the company did not have any material guarantees outstanding 
fin no 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
fin clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
for certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin applies to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
it applies in the third quarter of fiscal to variable interest entities in which the company may hold a variable interest that is acquired before february  the provisions of fin require that the company immediately disclose certain information if it is reasonably possible that the company will be required to consolidate or disclose variable interest entities when fin becomes effective 
based on its preliminary analysis and assessment  the company has determined that it does not hold any variable interests as of december  eitf no 
in november  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf issue no 
provides guidance on how to account for certain arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
the provisions of eitf issue no 
will apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  while the company will continue to evaluate the requirements of eitf issue no 
 management does not currently believe adoption will have a significant impact on its accounting for multiple element arrangements as such arrangements will generally continue to be accounted for pursuant to aicpa statement of position  software revenue recognition  and related pronouncements 
risk factors we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks  some of which are beyond the company s control 
you should read the cautionary statements in this document  wherever they appear  as applying to all related forward looking statements 
our actual results may differ materially from our projections due to  among other things  the occurrence of the risks described in detail below business environment risks the overall economic climate continues to be weak our products typically represent substantial capital commitments by customers  involving a potentially long sales cycle 
as a result  customer purchase decisions may be significantly affected by a variety of factors including trends in capital spending for 
table of contents telecommunications  enterprise software  market competition  and the availability or announcement of alternative technologies 
continued weakness in global economic conditions has resulted in many of our customers delaying and or reducing their capital spending decisions 
if the economy continues to be weak  demand for the company s products could decrease resulting in lower revenues and a decline in the overall rate of the company s revenue levels 
our company s business focus continues to evolve historically  we have supplied the hardware  software  and associated support services for implementing call center solutions 
our shift to an enterprise software solution business model has required and will continue to require substantial change  potentially resulting in some disruption to our business 
our inability to successfully continue or complete this transition in a timely manner could materially affect our business  operating results  or financial condition 
these changes may include the following changes in management and technical personnel  modifications to the pricing and positioning of our products which could impact revenues and operating results  expanded or differing competition resulting from entry into the enterprise software market  more revenues being deferred to future periods under software revenue recognition rules  and or an increased reliance on systems integrators to develop  deploy  and or manage our applications 
our revenues are dependent on a small number of products historically  sales of a small number of our products accounted for a substantial portion of product revenues 
demand for our products could be adversely affected by not meeting customer specifications and or by problems with system performance  system availability  installation or service delivery commitments  or market acceptance 
we need to develop new products and to manage product transitions in order to succeed 
if we fail to introduce new versions and releases of functional products in a timely manner  or enhancements to our existing products  customers may license competing products and we may suffer lost sales and could fail to achieve anticipated results 
our future operating results will depend on the demand for the product suite by future customers  including new and enhanced releases that are subsequently introduced 
if our competitors release new products that are superior to our products in performance or price  or if we fail to enhance our products or introduce new features and functionality in a timely manner  demand for our products may decline 
new versions of our products may not be released on schedule or may contain defects when released 
our service revenues are dependent on our installed base of customers we derive a significant portion of our revenues from services  which include support  consulting  and training 
as a result  if we lose a major customer or if a support contract is delayed or cancelled  our revenues would be adversely affected 
in addition  customers who have accounted for significant service revenues in the past may not generate revenues in future periods 
our failure to obtain new customers or additional orders from existing customers could also materially affect our operating results 
our gross margins are substantially dependent on our product mix it is difficult to predict the exact blended mix of products 
our market is intensely competitive the market for our products is intensely competitive  and competition is likely to intensify as companies in our industry consolidate to offer integrated solutions 
our principal competitors currently include companies in the contact center market and companies that market traditional telephony products and services 
as the market develops for converged voice data networks and products and the demand for pstn based call centers diminishes  companies in these markets are merging and obtaining significant positions in the crm and traditional telephony products market 
many current and potential competitors  including avaya inc  nortel networks corporation  rockwell international corporation  alcatel sa  siemens ag  cisco systems inc  iex corporation and blue pumpkin  inc may have considerably greater resources  larger customer bases and broader international presence than aspect 
consequently  the company expects to encounter substantial competition from these and other sources 

table of contents we are involved in litigation we are involved in litigation for a variety of matters 
any claim brought against us will likely have a financial impact  due to the effect on our common stock performance  the disruption of business associated costs  and diversion of management attention such a claim would cause 
in our industry  there has been extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights  and we are periodically notified of such claims by third parties 
we have been sued for alleged patent infringement 
we expect that software product developers and providers of software in markets similar to our markets will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry grows and the functionality of products overlap 
any claims  with or without merit  could be costly and time consuming to defend  divert our management s attention  cause product delays and have an adverse effect on our revenues and operating results 
if any of our products were found to infringe a third party s proprietary rights  we could be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements to be able to sell our products  which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
moreover  even if we negotiate license agreements with a third party  future disputes with such parties are possible 
if we are unable to resolve an intellectual property dispute through a license  settlement  or successful litigation  we could be subject to damage assessments and be prevented from making  using  or selling certain products or services 
in the future  we could become involved in other types of litigation  such as shareholder lawsuits for alleged violations of securities laws  claims by employees  and product liability claims 
doing business globally involves significant risk we market our products and services worldwide and anticipate entering additional countries in the future 
if we fail to enter certain major international markets successfully  our competitive position could be impaired and we may be unable to compete on a global scale 
the financial resources required to enter  establish  and grow new and existing international markets may be substantial  and international operations are subject to additional risks including the cost and timing of the multiple governmental approvals and product modifications required by many countries  market acceptance  exchange rate fluctuations  delays in market deregulation  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary operations  and or global economic climate considerations including potentially negative tax and foreign and domestic trade legislation  which could result in the creation of trade barriers such as tariffs  duties  quotas  and other restrictions 
acts of terrorism and war may impact our business 
the threat of terrorist attacks  continued international violence and war in various locations around the world have increased uncertainty as to the worldwide economic environment 
such uncertainty may impact our business in that customers may be less likely to make purchases under these circumstances 
additionally  should a future act of terrorism  war or violence occur  the impact on our sales and business is unknown 
regulatory changes and changes made to generally accepted accounting practices principles may impact our business the electronic communications industry in general is subject to a wide range of regulations throughout various markets and throughout various countries in which we currently operate or may wish to operate in the future 
in addition  new products and services may involve entering into different or newly regulated areas 
changes in these environments may impact our business and could affect our ability to operate in certain markets or certain regions from time to time 
revisions to generally accepted accounting principles will require us to review our accounting and financial reporting procedures in order to ensure continued compliance with required policies 
from time to 
table of contents time  such changes may have a short term impact in the reporting that we do  and these changes may impact market perception of our financial condition pending or new legislation may lead to an increase in our costs related to audits in particular and regulatory compliance generally  pending or new legislation may force us to seek other service providers for non audit related services  which may raise costs  and or changes in the legal climate may lead to additional liability fears  which may result in increased costs 
we may experience a shortfall in revenue or earnings or otherwise fail to meet public market expectations  which could materially and adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock 
our revenue and operating results may fluctuate significantly because of a number of facts  many of which are outside of our control 
some of these factors include product and price competition  our ability to develop and market new products and control costs  timing of new product introductions and product enhancements  further deterioration and changes in domestic and foreign markets and economies  success in expanding our global services organization  direct sales force and indirect distribution channels  activities of and acquisitions by competitors  appropriate mix of products licensed and services sold  level of international transactions  delay or deferral of customer implementations of our products  size and timing of individual license transactions  length of our sales cycle  performance by outsourced service providers  and the costs of the underlying contracts of these providers  that are critical to our operations 
one or more of the foregoing factors may cause our operating expenses to be disproportionately high during any given period or may cause our revenues and operating results to fluctuate significantly 
based upon the preceding facts  we may experience a shortfall in revenues or earnings or otherwise fail to meet public market expectations  which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and the market price of our common stock 
our failure to grow and maintain our relationships with systems integrators or value added resellers could impact our ability to market and implement our products and reduce future revenues failure to establish or maintain relationships with systems integrators or value added resellers would significantly harm our ability to license our products 
systems integrators and value added resellers install and deploy our products  and perform custom integration of systems and applications 
if these relationships fail  we will have to devote substantially more resources to the sales and marketing  implementation and support of our products that we would have to otherwise 
because competition for qualified personnel could again become intense  we may not be able to retain or recruit personnel  which could impact the development and sales of our product if we are unable to hire or retain qualified personnel  or if newly hired personnel fails to develop the necessary skills or fails to reach expected levels of productivity  our ability to develop and market our products will be impacted 
our success depends largely on the continued contributions of our key management  research and development  sales  service  operations and marketing personnel 

table of contents technology risks our intellectual property may be copied  obtained  or developed by third parties our success depends in part upon our internally developed technology 
despite the precautions we take to protect our intellectual property  unauthorized third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology 
in addition  third parties may develop similar technology independently 
technology is rapidly changing the market for our products and services is subject to rapid technological change and new product introductions 
current competitors or new market entrants may develop new  proprietary products with features that could adversely affect the competitive position of our products 
we may not successfully anticipate market demand for new products or services  or introduce them in a timely manner 
the convergence of voice and data networks  and wired and wireless communications could require substantial modification and customization of our current products and business models  as well as the introduction of new products 
further  customer acceptance of these new technologies may be slower than we anticipate 
we may not be able to compete effectively in these markets 
in addition  aspect s products must readily integrate with major third party security  telephony  front office  and back office systems 
any changes to these third party systems could require us to redesign our products  and any such redesign might not be possible on a timely basis or achieve market acceptance 
transaction risks acquisitions and investments may be difficult and disruptive we have made a number of acquisitions and have made minority equity investments in other companies 
acquisitions or investments we make may experience significant fluctuations in market value or may result in significant write offs or the issuance of additional equity or debt securities 
these acquisitions and investments can  therefore  be costly and disruptive  and we may be unable to successfully integrate a new business or technology into our business 
we may continue to make such acquisitions and investments  and there are a number of risks that future transactions could entail 
these risks include inability to successfully integrate or commercialize acquired technologies or otherwise realize anticipated synergies or economies of scale on a timely basis  diversion of management attention  adverse impact on our annual effective tax rate  dilution of existing equity holders  disruption of our ongoing business  inability to assimilate and or retain key technical and managerial personnel  inability to establish and maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures  and processes  potential legal liability for pre acquisition activities  permanent impairment of our equity investments  governmental  regulatory  or competitive responses to the proposed transactions  and or impairment of relationships with employees  vendors  and or customers including  in particular  acquired original equipment manufacturer and value added reseller relationships 
operations performance risks our revenues and operating results are uncertain and may fluctuate our revenues may fluctuate significantly from period to period 
there are many reasons for this variability  including the shift from telecommunications equipment to business communications software  and associated software applications  reduced demand for some of our products and services  a limited number of large orders accounting for a 
table of contents significant portion of product revenues in any particular quarter  the timing of consulting projects and completion of project milestones  the size and timing of individual software license transactions  dependence on new customers for a significant percentage of product revenues  the ability of our sales force to achieve quarterly revenue objectives  fluctuations in the results of existing operations  recently acquired subsidiaries  or distributors of our products or services  seasonality and mix of products and services and channels of distribution  our ability to sell support agreements and subsequent renewal agreements for support of our products  our ability to develop and market new products and control costs  and or changes in market growth rates for different products and services 
we may experience difficulty managing changes in our business the changes in our business may place a significant strain on our operational and financial resources 
we may experience substantial disruption from changes and could incur significant expenses and write offs 
we must carefully manage accounts receivables to limit credit risk 
we must also maintain inventories at levels consistent with product demand 
inaccurate data for example  credit histories or supply demand forecasts could quickly result in excessive balances or insufficient reserves 
we may experience difficulty expanding our distribution channels we have historically sold our products and services through our direct sales force and a limited number of distributors 
changes in customer preferences  the competitive environment  or other factors may require us to expand third party distributor  value added resellers  systems integrator  technology alliances  electronic  and other alternative distribution channels 
we may not be successful in expanding these distribution channels 
we are dependent on key personnel we depend on certain key management and technical personnel and on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel in labor markets characterized by high turnover among  high demand for  and limited supply of  qualified people  and we have recently experienced increased levels of turnover among such personnel 
we have recently undergone significant changes in senior management and technical personnel and may experience additional changes as a result of our shift from supplying telecommunications equipment to becoming a provider contact server software  and associated software applications 
we are dependent on third parties we have outsourced our manufacturing capabilities to third parties and are dependent upon those suppliers to execute the following activities on time and to an extremely high level of quality  order component level materials  build  configure and test systems and subassemblies  and ship products to meet our customers delivery requirements 
failure to ship product on time or failure to meet our rigid quality standards would result in delays to customers  customer dissatisfaction or cancellation of customer orders 
should we have on going performance issues with our manufacturing sub contractors  the process to move from one sub contractor to another is a lengthy and costly process that could affect our ability to execute customer shipment requirements and or might negatively affect revenue and or costs 
we depend on certain critical components in the production of our products and services 
some of these components are obtained only from a single supplier and only in limited quantities 
in addition  some of our major suppliers use proprietary technology and software code that could require significant redesign of our products in the case of a change in vendor 
further  suppliers could discontinue their products  or modify them in manners incompatible with our current use  or use manufacturing processes and tools that could not be easily migrated to other vendors 
we also outsource our information technology activities to third parties 
we rely heavily on these vendors to provide day to day support 
we may experience disruption in our business if any of these vendors have difficulty meeting our requirements 
we may experience difficulty subleasing our facilities the real estate market for office space is weak 
this has reduced and may continue to reduce our ability to sublease our excess office space and to charge reasonable lease rates 
our operations are geographically concentrated significant elements of our product development  manufacturing  information technology systems  corporate offices  and support functions are concentrated at a 
table of contents single location in the silicon valley area of california 
we also concentrate sales  administrative  and support functions and related infrastructure to support our international operations at our uk offices 
in the event of a natural disaster  such as an earthquake or flood  or localized extended outages of critical utilities or transportation systems  we could experience a significant business interruption 
financial capital market risks our debt and debt service obligations are significant we incurred million of principal indebtedness million principal at maturity from the sale of convertible subordinated debentures in august the book value of our zero coupon convertible subordinated debentures at december   closely approximated the fair market value of approximately million as compared to an accreted value or face value of million 
the convertible subordinated debentures can be put to the company on august  the exercise of this put could require the company to pay the then accreted value of approximately million in stock  cash or any combination thereof  at the company s discretion 
if the company had to convert these debentures using equity as of the end of fiscal  using the closing price of the company s common stock on december   this conversion would require the company to issue approximately million shares of its common stock  resulting in significant dilution to the company s stockholders 
currently  the company currently intends to redeem the convertible subordinated debentures with cash at or before the put date 
we entered into a credit agreement in august  which provides the company with a million revolving loan facility and a million senior secured term loan 
we had million outstanding under the term loan and outstanding under the revolver and have utilized million in letters of credit at december  we obtained a loan totaling million in october secured by our buildings in san jose 
we had million outstanding under the loan at december  this debt resulted in a ratio of long term debt to total shareholders equity of approximately to at december  as a result of these transactions  we have substantially increased our principal and interest obligations 
the degree to which we are leveraged could materially and adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing or renew existing financing and could make us more vulnerable to industry downturns and competitive pressures 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations will depend on our future performance  which will be subject to financial  business  and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  interest and investment income  and debt interest rate expense we perform sensitivity analysis studies on portions of our foreign currency exchange rate exposure  our debt interest rate exposure  and on our interest and investment income exposure to us interest rates  all using a threshold 
these exposures could impact our financial performance 
for further details  you should refer to the full detailed discussion in the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about financial market risk section 
the prices of our common stock and convertible subordinated debentures are volatile we operate in a rapidly changing high technology industry that exhibits significant stock market volatility 
accordingly  the price of our common stock and our convertible subordinated debentures may be subject to significant volatility 
our past financial performance is not necessarily a reliable indicator of future performance and historical data should not be used to predict future results or trends 
for any given quarter  a shortfall in our operating results from the levels expected by securities analysts or others could immediately and adversely affect the price of the convertible subordinated debentures and our common stock 
if we do not learn of such shortfalls until late in a fiscal quarter  there could be an even more immediate and adverse effect on the price of the convertible subordinated debentures and our common stock 
in addition  the relatively low trading volume of our common stock and debentures could exacerbate this volatility 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risk from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we manage our exposure to these and other risks through our regular operating and financing activities 
table of contents and  when appropriate  through our hedging activities 
our policy is not to use hedges or other derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
we deal with a diversified group of major financial institutions to limit the risk of non performance by any one institution on any financial instrument 
separate from our financial hedging activities discussed below  material changes in foreign exchange rates  interest rates  and  to a lesser extent  commodity prices could cause significant changes 
these changes could affect costs to manufacture and deliver our products and in our customers buying practices 
we have not substantially changed our risk management practices during and do not currently anticipate significant changes in financial market risk exposures in the near future that would require us to change our risk management practices 
debt and interest expense the fair market value of our zero coupon convertible subordinated debentures is sensitive to changes in interest rates and to the prices of our common stock into which it can be converted as well as the financial stability of the company 
because the yield to maturity on the debentures is fixed  our interest expense on the debt does not fluctuate with market rates 
actual gains or losses from retirement of these debentures may fluctuate  depending on changes in the financial stability of the company  common stock price  and interest rate movements see notes and for further discussion of the convertible subordinated debt outstanding as of december  
our outstanding line of credit of million as of december  under the credit agreement with comerica bank california and cit business credit is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical movement in interest rates applied to our outstanding line of credit balance as of december   indicated that such market movement would not have a material effect on our operating results 
as the interest rate on our million loan as of december  that is secured by our san jose buildings is fixed  our interest expense on the debt does not fluctuate with market rates 
foreign currency exchange revenues generated from international operations are generally denominated in foreign currencies 
we enter into outright forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge against fluctuations of significant intercompany account balances and monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a non functional currency 
in general  these contracts have maturities of one month or less 
market value gains and losses on these hedge contracts are substantially offset by fluctuations in the underlying balances being hedged  and the net financial impact has not been material in any of the three years presented 
as of december   our primary net foreign currency market exposures included euros  british pounds  and australian dollars 
a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical movement in foreign exchange rates applied to our hedging contracts as of december   indicated that these market movements would not have a material effect on our business  operating results  or financial condition 
actual gains or losses in the future may differ materially from this analysis  depending on actual changes in the timing and amount of interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate movements and our actual balances and hedges 
foreign currency rate fluctuations can impact the us dollar translation of our foreign operations in our consolidated financial statements 
in  these fluctuations have not been material to our operating results 
interest and investment income our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our investments are in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  and in high quality corporate issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
these investments are subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates increase 
the average duration of our investment portfolio as of december  was years 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of these instruments  we believe an immediate change in interest rates would be immaterial to our operating results
