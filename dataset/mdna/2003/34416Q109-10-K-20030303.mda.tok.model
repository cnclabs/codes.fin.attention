item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and notes thereto 
general our business strategy focuses on investing  structuring and managing a wide range of financial assets  including the acquisition of debt or equity positions in companies requiring assistance in restructuring their operations  investments in mortgage backed securities  provision of corporate mezzanine financing and other similar investments 
the company invests where its expertise in intensive asset management  credit analysis and financial structuring can create value and provide an appropriate risk adjusted rate of return 
the company maintains a flexible approach with respect to the nature of its investments  seeking to take advantage of opportunities as they arise or are developed 
critical accounting policies valuation at december   our largest asset was our portfolio of mortgage backed securities 
listed market prices are available for the majority of our portfolio  which consists of a fnma certificate 
however  listed market prices or dealer lender value opinions are not available for the subordinated mortgage backed securities in our portfolio 
accordingly  in the absence of these third party quotations  fair values for these subordinated mortgage backed securities are determined by us  using a third party valuation model and internally developed assumptions 
valuation models and assumptions impact the carrying value of our subordinated mortgage backed securities and the amount and timing of gains and losses recognized 
the use of different valuation models or assumptions could produce different financial results 
changes in the fixed income markets and the actual performance of our mortgage backed securities may impact our estimates of fair value in the future  potentially affecting  positively or negatively  our future operating results and equity 
our key valuation assumptions include default rates and loss severity  which account for the anticipated credit losses in the pools of loans underlying our mortgage backed securities 
other key valuation assumptions include prepayment rates and discount rates 
our internal valuation methodology calls for developing the key valuation assumptions of credit losses and prepayment speeds based upon the observable recent history of performance  generally averaged across the latest to months  subject to our general economic and market considerations 
our key valuation assumption of discount rates is developed based on the assessment of the current yields required by investors for similar classes of fixed income instruments 
we apply our valuation methodology consistently and believe that the resulting fair value estimates are reasonable  however  these estimated values may differ from those realized in a bona fide sale transaction  given the judgmental nature of the values of these assets 
due to deceases in benchmark interest rates and the positive effects of increased prepayments  we realized gains on the sale of mortgage backed securities in of million 
however  during the years ended december   and  we incurred significant impairment losses of million  and million  respectively  due to decreases in value of our mortgage backed securities 
these losses resulted from the worsening credit performance of our mortgage backed securities as well as increases in the market yields for investments of such high risk assets 
we believe our assumptions and the resulting estimated values of the mortgage backed securities at december  are conservative based on the facts and circumstances as of that date  however  there can be no assurance that there will be no future losses on these securities due to changes in their performance or overall market conditions 
sale recognition during  we carried out several significant sales of our mortgage backed securities and loans 
our accounting policy calls for the recognition of sales of financial instruments  including mortgage backed securities and loans  only when we irrevocably have surrendered control over these assets 
our accounting policy calls for the recognition of sales of real estate upon closing when we have transferred the usual risks of ownership and all or substantially all of the rewards of ownership to the buyer 
we do not retain any recourse or performance obligations with respect to our sales of assets 
our sales in were generally cash sales and the cash proceeds were not contingent upon any future event 
results of operations compared to net income 
our net income for the year ended december  amounted to million  or per share  compared to a net loss of million  or per share for the year ended december  the net income was primarily the result of gains on the sale of loans and securities of million  partially offset by our operating expenses 
the net loss is primarily attributable to million of market valuation losses and impairments and operating expenses 
net interest income 
the following tables set forth information regarding the total amount of income from interest earning assets and expenses from interest bearing liabilities and the resulting average yields and rates for the year ended december  average balance interest income expense yield rate dollars in thousands interest earning assets loan portfolios  mortgage backed securities available for sale   other investments  total interest earning assets   interest bearing liabilities borrowings   total interest bearing liabilities   net interest income before provision for loan losses spread net interest margin borrowings and interest expense relating to real estate investments are not included in this analysis 
net interest spread represents the unweighted difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin represents net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
for the year ended december  average balance interest income expense yield rate dollars in thousands interest earning assets loan portfolios   mortgage backed securities available for sale   other investments  total interest earning assets   interest bearing liabilities borrowings   total interest bearing liabilities   net interest income before provision for loan losses spread net interest margin borrowings and interest expense relating to real estate investments are not included in this analysis 
net interest spread represents the unweighted difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin represents net interest income divided by average interest earning assets 
prepayments  delinquencies and defaults affect the net spread of the company  primarily through their impact on mortgage loans that underlie the securities in our mortgage backed securities portfolio 
for principal and interest subordinated mortgage backed securities  which we generally purchase at a discount to principal amount  increased prepayments recapture the purchase discount sooner and therefore increases spread 
fewer prepayments would have the opposite effect  reducing spread 
the impact on spread  however  depends upon the degree to which actual prepayment differs from our assumptions for prepayment at the time we purchased the security 
we buy mortgage backed securities based on prepayment  delinquency and default assumptions 
delinquency itself has little effect on spread from our mortgage backed securities portfolio since the loan servicer for each security generally will advance both principal and interest payments 
more important is the loss severity on defaulted loans 
generally  the larger the loss severity is  the greater the reduction in spread will be 
however  our spread is only negatively impacted to the extent the principal face amount of defaults and the cumulative loss severity exceeds or is expected to exceed our assumptions at the time of purchase or as subsequently adjusted through an other than temporary impairment determination

changes in financial condition during  total assets increased to million from million at december  this increase was primarily the result of a net increase of million in investments in real estate  a net increase in cash of million and a net increase in securities available for sale of million 
these increases were partially offset by the sale of our million investment in wfsg 
total liabilities increased to million during the period  primarily as a result of a net increase of million in obligations under capital leases associated with the acquisition of real estate  the recognition of income taxes payable of million and the recognition of an obligation to purchase treasury stock of million 
securities available for sale 
at december   securities available for sale included mortgage backed securities with an aggregate market value of million  including realized and unrealized gains or losses  compared to million at december  this increase of million is primarily due to the purchase of million of securities and an increase in market value of million 
these increases were partially offset by the sale of million of securities and net principal payments received of million 
a substantial portion of the securities purchased consisted of a high credit quality fnma certificate and substantially all of the securities sold were lower credit quality securities  resulting in a substantial improvement in the credit quality of our portfolio of mortgage backed securities 
we entered into an employment agreement with robert g 
rosen which entitles him to a bonus payment based upon the excess of the cumulative net proceeds from the sale of certain of our mortgage backed securities over a specified target amount as defined in the employment agreement 
during  we sold several of the securities subject to the bonus agreement 
we substantially exceeded the specific target amount for the sale of these securities and the bonus that would have been payable to mr 
rosen has been reflected in the statement of operations 
in addition  there are approximately million in mortgage backed securities remaining at december   which are subject to the bonus arrangement 
the unrealized holding gain on securities available for sale included in other comprehensive income has been adjusted to reflect the amount of the bonus that would have been payable to mr 
rosen under his employment agreement  assuming the company had sold all of its mortgage backed securities at a selling price equal to the carrying value at december  loan portfolio 
during the year ended december   our loan portfolio was reduced by approximately million primarily as a result of the sale of a loan with a carrying value of million 
this decrease was partially offset by the purchase of million in outstanding debt of dac for a purchase price of approximately million 
dac produces and markets lens manufacturing equipment 
the debt is evidenced by a new promissory note  which bears interest at the greater of the prime rate plus or the federal funds rate plus 
the note requires monthly principal and interest payments and matures on august  the note is secured by substantially all of the assets of dac 
as of december   dac had made all of the required payments under the note 
investments in real estate 
investments in real estate increased approximately million during the year ended december  this increase was primarily the result of the acquisition of capital leasehold interests in free standing retail stores located throughout the united states 
the purchase was made through our wholly owned subsidiary  fog cap retail investors llc 
the capital leases cover approximately  square feet of retail space 
the stores are free standing  retail locations ranging from  square feet each 
leaseholds are  in general  years  and cover a broad tenant mix including convenience stores  shoe stores  video stores  auto parts dealers  pawn shops  carpet retailers and other small businesses 
we capitalized a million investment in real estate as a result of this transaction  and recognized a capital lease obligation of million 
as part of the same transaction  we also acquired non capitalized  operating leases on an additional retail stores covering  square feet 
the operating leases have remaining initial terms averaging four years  however  the terms of the leases may be extended at our election 
the properties subject to these operating leases are also sublet to similar types of small businesses as described above 
the million purchase price for the non capitalized operating leases is included in other assets in the accompanying statements of financial position 
of the retail locations  were vacant at december  investments in wfsg 
in may  we sold  through several brokerage transactions to third parties  our entire holdings of approximately million shares of the common stock of wilshire financial services group inc wfsg 
the sales were prompted by improved market conditions surrounding wfsg and resulted in a gain on sale of securities of million 
as a result of the disposal of our entire interest in wfsg  we withdrew our application for change in control of a bank holding company form h e  which had been filed with the office of thrift supervision on march  other assets 
at december   the company s other assets consisted of the following loans to executives  capitalized deferred compensation  proceeds due from sale of securities  investment in operating leases  other  total  borrowings 
at december   we had million of borrowings consisting entirely of repurchase agreements on mortgage backed securities 
our borrowings had a weighted average interest rate of at december  obligations under capital leases 
obligations under capital leases increased approximately million during the year ended december  this increase was the result of the acquisition of capital leasehold interests in free standing retail stores located throughout the united states 
obligation to purchase treasury stock 
effective july   we entered into an agreement the assignment in which we accepted the assignment of the obligations of the grantor under a put option dated october  which had been granted by andrew a 
wiederhorn to lawrence a 
mendelsohn mendelsohn and a group of related shareholders of the company the stockholders 
mr 
wiederhorn is the chairman of the board and chief executive officer of the company 
at the time of the assignment  mr 
mendelsohn was the president and a member of the board of directors of the company 
mr 
mendelsohn resigned from the company on august  under the assignment  the stockholders had the option the put option to require us to purchase up to  shares of the company s common stock the option shares at a price per share equal to eighty percent of the book value per share of the company as of the end of the most recent calendar month preceding the delivery of the exercise notice the evaluation date 
the stockholders exercised their right to require us to purchase the option shares on december  the option price was determined to be per share and the closing date was february  one third of the purchase price for the shares purchased under the option agreement was paid in cash to the stockholders at closing 
the remaining purchase price was paid with a promissory note which matures months following the closing date and which bears interest at for the first days and per annum thereafter 
the note may be prepaid at any time without penalty or premium 
the assumption and subsequent exercise of the assignment resulted in our recording a million liability for the obligation to purchase treasury stock as of december  of this amount  million  which represents the amount that will be recorded as treasury stock upon the closing  was deducted from permanent stockholders equity 
the remaining million  representing the difference between the strike price of the option shares and the quoted price of the option shares on nasdaq on the assumption date  was recorded as a charge to earnings 
income taxes payable 
our income taxes payable increased to million at december  this was the result of an accrued provision for income taxes of million and the establishment of a tax liability of million relating to unrealized appreciation on our mortgage backed securities portfolio 
as of december   we had  for us federal tax purposes  a net operating loss carryforward nol of approximately million which begins to expire in the nol may significantly reduce or eliminate the future payment of the tax liability 
however  us tax regulations impose limitations on the use of loss carry forwards following certain changes in ownership 
if such a change occurs  the limitation could significantly reduce the amount of benefits that would be available to offset future taxable income each year  starting with the year of ownership change 
in order to protect the nol  on october   we announced a dividend distribution of one right a right to purchase one tenth of a share of our common stock for each outstanding share of common stock  payable to the stockholders of record on october  the record date 
rights will also be attached to each common share issued after the record date 
generally  each right entitles the registered holder to purchase one tenth of a common share from us at a price of per whole common share 
the rights are intended to protect our income tax loss carryforward from the limitations imposed under the internal revenue code if there is a change in control 
under certain circumstances  individuals attempting to acquire a ownership interest in the company or individuals attempting to increase their existing holdings in excess of by more than will have their interests immediately diluted through distributions of stock to all other right holders 
the description and terms of the rights are set forth in a rights agreement the rights agreement between us and the bank of new york  as rights agent  dated as of october  we filed a summary of the rights agreement with the securities and exchange commission on form k on october  stockholders equity 
stockholders equity increased by approximately million during the year ended december  this was primarily due to our net income of million 
this increases was partially offset by the declaration of dividends in the amount of million  our purchase during the year of treasury stock in the amount of million and the deduction of million relating to common stock which we are obligated to repurchase 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is a measurement of our ability to meet potential cash requirements  including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings  fund investments  engage in loan acquisition and lending activities  meet collateral calls and for other general business purposes 
the primary sources of funds for liquidity during the year ended december  consisted of net cash provided by investing activities  including cash repayments related to our mortgage backed securities portfolio  and the sale of mortgage backed securities and loans 
our borrowings and the availability of further borrowings are substantially affected by  among other things  changes in interest rates  changes in market spreads whereby the market value of the collateral securing such borrowings may decline substantially  or decreases in credit quality of underlying assets 
in the event of declines in market value or credit quality  we may be required to provide additional collateral for  or repay a portion of outstanding balances of  our short term borrowing facilities 
however  during the quarter ending june   we repaid or replaced all of our short term  fully recourse  repurchase agreements with non recourse  short term repurchase agreements held in wholly owned subsidiaries 
as a result  our potential risk from collateral calls is limited to the equity in the assets being financed  which at december  totaled million 
we consider the potential exposure to collateral calls to be significantly less than the million equity since million relates to our equity in a aaa rated fnma security 
as of december   we had no outstanding collateral calls 
for additional information with respect to our monthly mark to market of our securities available for sale portfolio  see changes in financial condition securities available for sale 
fluctuations in interest rates will continue to impact our net interest income to the extent our fixed rate assets are funded by variable rate debt or our variable rate assets reprice on a different schedule or in relation to a different index than any floating rate debt which in turn could impact potential returns to shareholders 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
at december   we had total consolidated secured indebtedness of million  as well as million of other liabilities 
the consolidated secured indebtedness consisted of i million of repurchase agreements secured by million of mortgage backed securities and ii million outstanding of capital leases maturing between and which are secured by real estate 
approximately million of this indebtedness had terms which allowed the lender to request additional collateral if the value of the underlying collateral declined 
however  due to the non recourse nature of this debt  our exposure to collateral calls is limited to the equity in the assets being financed 
if our existing liquidity position were to prove insufficient  and we were unable to fund additional collateral requirements or to repay  renew or replace maturing indebtedness on terms reasonably satisfactory to us  we may be required to sell potentially on short notice a portion of our assets  and could incur losses as a result 
furthermore  since from time to time there is extremely limited liquidity in the market for subordinated and residual interests in mortgage related securities  there can be no assurance that we will be able to dispose of such securities promptly for fair value in such situations 
we consider the sale of assets to be a normal  recurring part of our operations and we are currently generating positive cash flow as a result of these transactions 
however  excluding the sale of assets from time to time  we are currently operating with negative cash flow  since many of our assets do not generate current cash flows sufficient to cover current operating expenses 
we believe that our existing sources of funds will be adequate for purposes of meeting our liquidity needs  however  there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
material increases in interest expense from variable rate funding sources  collateral calls  or material decreases in monthly cash receipts  generally would negatively impact our liquidity 
on the other hand  material decreases in interest expense from variable rate funding sources or an increase in market value of our mark to market financial assets generally would positively affect our liquidity 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  and equity prices 
we have some exposure to foreign currency fluctuations approximately of the company s equity is invested in assets located in the united kingdom at december   which we have mitigated through the purchase of two great britain pound gbp put options 
the contracts entitle us to sell a total of gbp million for us dollars usd at an exchange rate of usd per one gbp 
the options expire during the estimated fair value of these currency hedging contracts was million at december   and was included in other assets on the accompanying statement of financial condition 
the primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk 
this type of risk is highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations  and other factors 
changes in the general level of interest rates can affect our net interest income by affecting the spread between our interest earning assets and our interest bearing liabilities 
changes in the level of interest rates can also affect  among other things  the value of our interest earning assets including mortgage backed securities and our ability to acquire loans 
it is our objective to attempt to control risks associated with interest rate movements 
in general  our strategy is to limit our exposure to earnings variations and variations in the value of assets and liabilities as interest rates change over time 
our asset and liability management strategy is formulated and monitored regularly to review  among other things  the sensitivity of our assets and liabilities to interest rate changes  the book and market values of assets and liabilities  unrealized gains and losses  including those attributable to hedging transactions  purchase and securitization activity  and maturities of investments and borrowings 
the following table quantifies the potential changes in net interest income and net portfolio value as of december  should interest rates go up or down shocked by or basis points  assuming the yield curves of the rate shocks will be parallel to each other and instantaneous 
net portfolio value is calculated as the sum of the value of off balance sheet instruments and the present value of cash in flows generated from interest earning assets net of cash out flows in respect of interest bearing liabilities 
the cash flows associated with the loan portfolios and securities available for sale are calculated based on prepayment and default rates that vary by asset but not by changes in interest rates 
projected losses  as well as prepayments  are generated based upon the actual experience with the subject pool  as well as similar  more seasoned pools 
to the extent available  loan characteristics such as loan to value ratio  interest rate  credit history and product types are used to produce the projected loss and prepayment assumptions that are included in the cash flow projections of the securities 
the following table applies the us treasury yield curve generally for assets and libor for repurchase agreement liabilities and assume a uniform change in both rates 
the table assumes that changes in interest rates occur instantaneously 
the table also reflects that we have a significant exposure to libor rates since our short term repurchase agreement borrowings are generally based on libor rates 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimated in the table 
projected percent change in change in interest rates net interest income net portfolio value change in monthly interest income change in net portfolio value basis points   basis points   basis points basis points   basis points   assumes that uniform changes occur instantaneously in both the yield on year us treasury notes and the interest rate applicable to us dollar deposits in the london interbank market 
the following table sets forth information as to the type of funding used to finance the company s assets as of december  as indicated in the table  a large percentage of the company s fixed rate assets are financed by floating rate liabilities and the company s variable rate assets are generally funded by variable rate liabilities which use the same index

asset and liability management involves managing the timing and magnitude of the repricing of assets and liabilities 
it is our objective to attempt to control risks associated with interest rate movements 
asset and liability management can utilize a wide variety of off balance sheet financial techniques to assist it in the management of interest rate risk 
for example  in hedging the interest rate and exchange rate exposure of a foreign currency denominated asset or liability  we may enter into hedge transactions to counter movements in the different currencies as well as interest rates in those currencies 
these hedges may be in the form of currency and interest rate swaps  options  and forwards  or combinations thereof 
no such interest rate techniques were in use as of december  methods for evaluating interest rate risk include an analysis of our interest rate sensitivity gap  which is defined as the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to affect net interest income adversely 
since different types of assets and liabilities with the same or similar maturities may react differently to changes in overall market rates or conditions  changes in interest rates may affect net interest income positively or negatively even if an institution were perfectly matched in each maturity category 
the following table sets forth the estimated contractual maturity or repricing of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  as of december  within months to months one year to years more than years total dollars in thousands interest sensitive assets cash and cash equivalents   securities available for sale    loans   other   total rate sensitive assets    interest sensitive liabilities borrowings    total rate sensitive liabilities   interest rate sensitivity gap    cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap    cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap as a percentage of total rate sensitive assets real estate property holdings are not considered interest rate sensitive
