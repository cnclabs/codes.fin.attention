item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of its results of operations and financial condition are based upon consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management believes the critical accounting policies and areas that require the most significant judgments and estimates to be used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are pension and other postretirement plan assumptions  goodwill  product  environmental and other litigation liabilities  management incentive compensation plans and income tax accounting 
pension and other postretirement plan assumptions the company sponsors defined benefit pension plans in both us and foreign entities 
also in the us the company sponsors other postretirement plans for health care and life insurance costs 
expenses and liabilities for the pension plans and other postretirement plans are actuarially calculated 
these calculations are based on management s assumptions related to the discount rate  expected return on assets and projected salary increases 
the annual measurement date for these assumptions is august note to the consolidated financial statements includes disclosure of these rates for both the foreign and domestic plans 
the discount rate assumption is tied to a long term high quality bond index and is therefore subject to annual fluctuations 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of the pension obligations  which results in higher pension expense 
the discount rate in the us was percent at august  as compared to percent at august  and percent at august  the percent at august  was used to calculate the pension and other postretirement plans expense 
a discount rate reduction of percentage points increases pension and other postretirement plan expense by approximately million 
discount rates for the company s non us plans are determined in a manner consistent with the us plan 
the expected return on assets assumptions on the us investment portfolios for the pension and other postretirement benefit plans are based on the long term expected returns for the investment mix of assets currently in the portfolios 
because the rate of return is a long term assumption  it generally does not change annually 
management uses historic return trends of the asset portfolio combined with recent market conditions to estimate the rate of return 
the current investment mix in the portfolios is nearly percent in us equities 
since  the company has been using an expected return on asset assumption for the portfolio of percent 
this was consistent with the long term asset returns of the portfolio 
at august   given the recent poor performance of the us equity markets  management lowered the expected rate of return assumption to percent on the us pension plans and percent on the postretirement plans 
these rates will be used in calculating the expenses for a change of percentage points for the expected return assumptions will impact net benefit plans expense by approximately million 
the projected salary increase assumption is based on historic trends and comparisons to the external market 
higher rates of increase result in higher pension expenses 
as this rate is also a long term expected rate it is less likely to change on an annual basis 
in the us  management has used the rate of percent for the past three years 
goodwill goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a purchase business combination 
as of november  the company s balance sheet included approximately million of goodwill 
the goodwill is primarily included in the global adhesives operating segment 
on december  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 the new accounting standard for goodwill 
this standard requires that goodwill no longer is amortized on a recurring basis 
instead  the goodwill is subject to annual impairment testing 
sfas no 
requires that the company  on an annual basis  calculate the fair value of the reporting units that contain the goodwill and compare that to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if impairment exists 
impairment testing must take place more often if circumstances or events indicate a change in the impairment status 
the standard also required that  upon adoption  the company make an initial impairment calculation 
both the initial calculation and the subsequent annual calculation confirmed that the fair value of the reporting units exceeded the carrying values 
management judgment is required in calculating the fair value of the reporting units 
the calculation uses a discounted cash flow analysis that requires management to project financial performance 
the projections are based on management s best estimate given recent financial performance  market trends  strategic plans and other available information 
future results will most likely differ from the projected results 
however  based on the margin that fair value exceeded carrying value of the various reporting units  management does not anticipate a material impact on the company s financial results from differences in these assumptions 
product  environmental and other litigation liabilities as stated in item of this annual report and in note and note to the consolidated financial statements  the company is subject to various lawsuits and other legal proceedings 
accruals for loss contingencies associated with these lawsuits and other proceedings are made when it is determined that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the assessment of the probable liabilities is based on the facts and circumstances known at the time that the financial statements are being prepared 
for cases in which it is determined that a liability has been incurred but only a range for the potential amount exists  the minimum amount of the range is recorded and subsequently adjusted  as better information becomes available 
for cases in which insurance coverage is available  the company accrues the gross amount of the estimated liabilities  including legal costs and also records a receivable for any probable estimated insurance recoveries 
in the eifs litigation referred to in note  the company has accrued million for the potential liabilities and million for potential insurance recoveries 
management does not believe that the ultimate outcome of any pending legal proceedings  individually or in aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
management incentive compensation plans management incentive plans are subject to various financial performance metrics 
these metrics relate to the consolidated financial results of the company as well as the performance of individual operating units within the company for which a particular manager has responsibility 
accruals made throughout the year related to the various incentive plans are based on management s best estimate of the achievement of the specific annual financial metrics 
adjustments are made to the accruals on a quarterly basis as forecasts of financial performance are updated 
the quarterly accruals are based on the percentage of the annual metric achieved in that particular quarter 
at year end  the accruals are adjusted to reflect the actual results achieved 
income tax accounting as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
the process involves estimating actual current tax expense along with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for book and tax purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the consolidated balance sheet 
management records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
management has considered future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
increases in the valuation allowance result in additional expense to be reflected within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of income 
at november   the valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets totaled million 
results of operations compared to and note fiscal years and were week years and fiscal year was a week year 
net revenue net revenue in of  million was million or percent less than the net revenue recorded in the net revenue in of  million was percent less than the  million recorded in in  the percent decrease in net revenue consisted of a decrease in volume of percent  a decrease in selling prices of percent and an increase due to the currency effects from a weaker us dollar of percent 
the decrease as compared to was consistent across the company s operating segments as both the global adhesives segment and the full valu specialty segment reported net revenue decreases of percent 
the net revenue decrease of percent in as compared to resulted from a decrease in volume of percent  an increase in selling prices of percent and a decrease due to the currency effects from a stronger us dollar of percent 
approximately percentage points of the percent volume decrease in was attributed to having one less week in as compared to net revenue in the global adhesives segment decreased percent in as compared to and the net revenue in the full valu specialty segment decreased percent as compared to there were no significant net revenue increases or decreases attributed to acquisitions or divestitures in as compared to  or in as compared to gross profit margin the consolidated gross profit margin of percent in was percentage points less than the percent recorded in the consolidated gross profit margin in was percent 
the cost of sales included million of charges related to the company s restructuring plan which reduced the gross profit margin by percentage points 
nearly offsetting the cost increase due to restructuring were lower raw material costs as a percentage of net revenue 
the raw material cost decrease in as compared to was not only due to lower prices paid for raw materials  but also to product reformulations  product line consolidation and other manufacturing process initiatives that improved our overall usage of raw materials 
the cost of sales included million of asset impairment charges related to the restructuring plan  which reduced the gross profit margin by percentage points 
the gross margin was lower than the gross margin recorded in mainly due to increases in raw material prices in as compared to lower unit volume in as compared to also contributed to the reduced gross profit margin in  as the fixed component of manufacturing costs became a higher percentage of net revenue 
selling  administrative and other sg a expenses sg a expenses were million in  million in and million in included in the sg a expenses were million of one time charges related to the company s restructuring plan 
also contributing to the increase in sg a expenses in as compared to was the effect of the company s pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
in  the company recognized expense of million from the pension and other postretirement plans as compared to income of million in of this million adverse effect from the benefit plans  over million resulted from changes in the us benefit plans 
these increases were due primarily to the poor performance of the benefit plan asset portfolios in and lower interest rates also contributed to the higher expenses from the benefit plans because the benefit obligation increases when there is a decrease in the interest rate used to discount the liability 
another increase in sg a expenses in as compared to resulted from an increase in management incentive compensation expense of approximately million 
management incentives depend substantially upon the company s financial performance compared to targets set at the beginning of the year 
in  financial results achieved as compared to targets were significantly better than the comparable financial performance in mitigating the negative effects on sg a expenses in from the restructuring plan  benefit plans and management incentives were expense reductions resulting from spending controls and reduced employee census 
total number of employees was  at november  as compared to  at december  the net decrease of employees in as compared to consisted of employees included in sg a and included in cost of sales 
the decrease of million in sg a expenses in as compared to resulted primarily from two items 
one was an increase of million in income from the company s pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
was the last year that the company realized the benefits in the pension and other postretirement benefit plans of the strong asset portfolio performance of the late s 
the second key reason for reduced sg a expenses in as compared to was the fact that fiscal year was a week year as compared to weeks in the extra week resulted in an approximate increase in sg a expenses of million 
other contributing factors to the expense decrease in as compared to were the currency effects from a stronger us dollar and reduced payroll costs due to lower employee census 
the total number of employees at december  of  was less than the  employees at december  of the total decrease of employees  were included in sg a expenses and were included in cost of sales 
interest expense interest expense was million in  million in and million in lower average debt levels were the primary reason for the reduced interest expense in as compared to both and strong operating cash flow allowed the company to reduce average debt levels 
gains from sales of assets the company recorded gains from sales of assets of million in as compared to million in and million in the results included gains of million from sales of assets that were included in the company s restructuring initiative 
of the remaining gains of million  the most significant was the sale of an office building in latin america that resulted in a gain of million 
the most significant transaction in was the sale of a cost basis equity investment in a japanese company  which resulted in a gain of million  offset by losses from disposals or sales of other non productive assets 
in  the company actively sold non productive assets 
the sale of two facilities in north america accounted for more than half of the million gain in other income expense  net other income expense  net was expense of million in  million in and million in the adoption of sfas in  which resulted in the cessation of goodwill amortization expense was the primary reason for the lower expense in as compared to and the other expense in both and included million of goodwill amortization expense 
in  million of amortization expense associated with investment properties specifically held to generate income tax credits was reclassified to other expense from income tax expense 
corresponding reclassifications were also made for and of million and million  respectively 
foreign currency transaction losses were million in  million in and million in the losses in each year were primarily the result of currency devaluations in latin american countries  which operate on a us dollar functional currency 
the significant components of other income expense  net are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes the effective income tax rate was percent in  percent in and percent in in the fourth quarter of the effective tax rate  excluding the effects of the restructuring initiative  was reduced from percent to percent due solely to the reclassification of amortization expense associated with investment properties specifically held to generate income tax credits 
the more appropriate presentation of this amortization expense is to treat such amounts as other expense rather than as an offset to the related income tax credits 
therefore  million of amortization expense in was reclassified from income tax expense to other expense while corresponding adjustments were made to years and for million and million  respectively 
these reclassifications had no effect on net income or earnings per share 
in  the impact of the restructuring initiative lowered the effective rate by percentage points due to the tax deductibility of the restructuring expenses in countries with tax rates higher than the overall company average 
the income tax expense included a one time tax benefit of million 
per diluted share resulting from changes in the company s business structure in europe 
the changes in business structure allowed the company to take advantage of tax losses that were not previously recognizable under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
excluding the one time tax benefit  the effective income tax rate in was percent 
net income net income in was million as compared to million in and million in charges related to the restructuring plan in reduced net income by million 
the net income included an after tax charge of million 
per diluted share related to the company s adoption of the sec s staff accounting bulletin sab revenue recognition 
the charge was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
also included in the net income were million million after tax of asset impairment charges as discussed previously under gross profit margin and the million 
per diluted share one time tax benefit discussed under income taxes 
there were no significant one time charges or credits that affected the net income 
the income per diluted share as reported was in  in and in operating segment results compared to and note management evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on operating income which is defined as gross profit less sg a expenses and excluding the amortization of goodwill and gains on the sales of assets 
charges  net of gains on the sales of assets in connection with the company s restructuring initiatives are excluded from its operating segment results  consistent with internal management reporting 
corporate expenses are fully allocated to the operating segments 
see further discussion in note to the consolidated financial statements 
global adhesives net revenue of million in was percent less than net revenue of million in sales volume decreased percent primarily due to the slower global economies in as compared to currency effects were positive percent as a result of the weakening of the us dollar in the second half of  especially as compared to the euro 
the year over year comparisons in the third and fourth quarters of as compared to the same periods in reflected positive currency variances from europe of percent and percent  respectively 
selling prices decreased percent in as compared to as reduced industry demand resulted in significant pricing pressure in the competition for market share 
the nonwoven market reported sales in that were well ahead of strong volume growth in europe was a key to the sales growth in nonwoven 
the automotive market also had strong growth in as compared to as dealer incentive programs and low interest rates increased vehicle production in the us the graphic arts  converting and assembly markets recorded sales decreases in as compared to each of these markets was impacted by the slow global economies 
the net revenue in of million was percent less than the net revenue of million in the main reason for the decline in net revenue in as compared to was reduced volume of approximately percent 
about percent of the reduced volume can be attributed to having one less week than  however the primary reason was the slowdown in economic activity in as compared to currency effects negatively impacted net revenue percent in as compared to primarily due to the relative strength of the us dollar against major foreign currencies such as the euro  british pound sterling  japanese yen and australian dollar 
offsetting these declines were selling prices  which increased percent in as compared to operating income in the global adhesives segment was million in as compared to million in and million in as a percentage of net revenue the operating income was percent in as compared to percent in and percent in the gross profit margin increased percentage points in as compared to primarily due to lower raw material costs as a percentage of net revenue 
manufacturing efficiencies resulting from capacity reductions and product line consolidation also contributed to the improved margin 
sg a expenses increased approximately million or percent in as compared to the reduced pension and other postretirement benefit income of million and the increase in management incentive compensation expenses of million drove the increase in sg a expenses 
these increases in sg a expenses were partially offset by expense reductions due to reduced employee census and tight controls on discretionary spending 
in  operating income was less than largely due to lower net revenue in as compared to the lower net revenue in of million resulted in an operating income decrease of only million because of lower sg a expenses 
expenses decreased in as compared to primarily in the north american region of global adhesives because of increased us pension and other postretirement benefit income of approximately million and reduced bad debt expenses of nearly million 
offsetting these expense reductions in as compared to was increased expenses of approximately million in europe in connection with implementing a new business structure for the region 
full valu specialty net revenue of million in was percent less than the million of net revenue in sales volume decreased percent  selling prices decreased percent and currency effects negatively impacted net revenue by percent 
the powder coatings market  which is primarily in north america  had the most significant sales decrease in as compared to the powder coatings market was negatively impacted by the overall slowdown in the us economy and increased competition from larger manufacturers in as compared to partially offsetting the reduced revenue from the powder coatings market were strong revenue growth in the ceramic tile setting materials market and in the window market 
these markets were both impacted favorably by the strength of the us housing market 
the net revenue in of million was percent below the net revenue in of million 
the revenue decrease was driven by lower sales volume  primarily in the powder coatings market  liquid paint market in central america and the ceramic tile setting materials market 
the window and hvac markets reflected increases in net revenue in as compared to operating income in the full valu specialty segment was million in as compared to million in and million in the gross profit margin in increased by percentage points as compared to the reduction in operating income in was driven by increases in sg a expenses 
similar to the global adhesives segment  sg a expenses increased million because of the reduced income attributed to the pension and other postretirement benefit plans and million due to the increased management incentive compensation 
additional product liability costs of approximately million also contributed to the higher sg a expenses in as compared to headcount reductions and discretionary spending controls partially offset these expense increases 
the decrease in operating income of million as compared to was caused mainly by the million reduction in revenue 
restructuring and other related costs during  net pretax charges of million million after tax and minority interests were recorded in connection with the company s restructuring plan that was announced on january  the plan  which was contemplated in  but approved and implemented throughout  will be completed in the first half of completion of the plan will result in the elimination of approximately percent of the company s global manufacturing capacity 
throughout  the company closed twelve manufacturing facilities in the global adhesives operating segment eight in north america  three in latin america and one in europe 
in the full valu specialty operating segment  one manufacturing facility was closed and one production line was shut down in another facility  both in the united states 
in connection with the restructuring plan  the company upgraded and realigned its sales force in the global adhesives operating segment 
by reducing capacity and eliminating other cost structures management currently estimates that upon completion of all restructuring related activities  operating costs will be reduced approximately to million annually 
these savings  consisting primarily of reduced employee related costs and reduced depreciation expenses  were approximately million in the plan will result in the elimination of approximately positions  of which approximately occurred in the principal employee group affected by the restructuring plan was manufacturing employees 
however  other employee groups affected include certain corporate administrative positions and certain sales positions in the global adhesives segment 
offsetting the reduction of positions  will be approximately newly hired employees of which were hired as of november   primarily in manufacturing facilities that assumed additional volume which transferred from facilities that were closed as part of the restructuring plan  and sales related positions as part of the upgrading and realignment of the sales force 
upon completion of the restructuring plan in the first half of  the company expects to have recorded total cumulative net pretax charges in the range of to million  inclusive of the million of accelerated depreciation charges recorded in the fourth quarter of  and net of gains associated with asset sales subject to the restructuring plan 
these charges include employee separation costs  accelerated depreciation on assets held and used until disposal  lease contract termination costs and other costs directly related to the restructuring plan 
the remaining net charges of approximately million to million will be incurred in the first half of the most significant of these remaining charges are expected to be employee separation costs in the european adhesives operations 
cash costs of the plan are expected to be to million  of which million have been paid as of november  the following table summarizes the restructuring charges and the related restructuring liabilities employee severance and accelerated in thousands benefits depreciation other total balance at december  charges first quarter     second quarter    third quarter     fourth quarter     total charges     non cash    currency change effect cash payments    total liabilities at november  
   long term portion of liabilities   current liabilities at november     the net pretax charges of million million offset by gains on sales of assets of million in were included in the income statement as million in cost of sales  million in sg a expense and gains on sales of assets of million 
the million in cost of sales consisted of million of employee severance and benefits  million of accelerated depreciation  million of adverse lease termination costs and million of other costs directly attributed to the restructuring plan 
the other costs are primarily period costs associated with the closure of manufacturing facilities such as equipment tear down and decommissioning expenses  facility maintenance and clean up costs  equipment and inventory relocation and employee relocation expenditures 
the million in sg a expenses consisted of million of employee severance and benefits  million of accelerated depreciation  million of adverse lease termination costs and million of other costs directly attributed to the restructuring plan 
the gains on sales of assets resulted from the sales of two facilities and one product line that were shut down or discontinued as part of the restructuring plan 
of the total net pretax charges of million incurred in  million was attributed to the global adhesives operating segment  million to the full valu specialty operating segment and corporate office cost centers recorded million 
the gains on sales of assets were attributed to the global adhesives operating segment 
non cash charges attributed to employee severance and benefits are related to the granting of accelerated vesting on restricted stock held by certain employees subject to the restructuring and to net losses resulting from curtailment and other special termination benefits associated with the u 
s pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
the long term portion of the restructuring liability relates to adverse lease commitments that are expected to be paid beyond one year 
the beginning balance of million in the restructuring liability relates to a prior restructuring plan 
in january  the securities and exchange commission issued regulation g  conditions for use of non gaap financial measures a rule directed by the sarbanes oxley act of regulation g requires public companies that disclose or release non gaap financial measures to include the most directly comparable gaap financial measure  to provide a reconciliation of the disclosed non gaap measure to the most comparable gaap measure  and requires companies to furnish earnings releases or similar announcements to the commission on form k 
the requirements of this rule will be effective as of march  additional guidance in the rule also addresses what constitutes non recurring  infrequent  or unusual as applied to specific financial transactions or events 
the company has provided a reconciliation of any differences between non gaap financial reporting which is most comparable to the accounting principles generally accepted in the united states for financial reporting 
in addition to regulation g  the sec amended item of regulation s k to provide additional guidance to registrants that include non gaap financial measures in sec filings 
this guidance will prohibit the presentation of certain non gaap financial measures that exclude from reported results non recurring  infrequent or unusual items when the nature of the charge or gain is such that it is reasonably likely to recur within two years or there was a similar charge or gain within the two prior years 
implementation of these rules will result in a presentation different than that reflected in the following table as it relates to the effects of the company s ongoing restructuring plan in the following is supplemental consolidated statement of income information

recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations which must be adopted no later than december  this statement establishes accounting standards for recognition and measurement of a liability for an asset retirement obligation and the associated asset retirement cost 
the company is currently reviewing the requirements of sfas based on its preliminary assessment  management does not expect  upon adoption of sfas  there will be any material effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections

in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this standard supersedes eitf no 
and will be adopted for exit and disposal activities initiated after december  the principal difference between sfas no 
and eitf no 
relates to when an entity can recognize a liability related to exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires that a liability be recognized for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity at the time the liability is incurred 
eitf no 
allowed a liability to be recognized at the date an entity committed to an exit plan 
had sfas no 
been in effect in fiscal year  there would have been no material change to the company s financial position or results of operations as reported 
as well  the impact of adopting this accounting standard will not have a material effect on the company s future financial position and results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 

the company intends to continue its current accounting practice of applying the recognition and measurement principles of apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  however  additional disclosure requirements of sfas no 
are included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin provides guidance on disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
the interpretation also clarifies for guarantees issued after december  that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligations undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the company does not have any significant guarantees as of november   other than those found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
fin provides accounting requirements for business enterprises to consolidate related entities in which they are determined to be the primary beneficiary as a result of their variable economic interests 
the interpretation provides guidance in judging multiple economic interests in an entity and in determining the primary beneficiary 
the interpretation outlines disclosure requirements for variable interest entities vies in existence prior to january   and provides consolidation requirements for vies created after january  the company is in the process of reviewing relationships in which it has an economic interest and other relationships with related parties  toll manufacturing vendors  and other suppliers to determine the extent of its economic interest in the underlying operations 
although the assessment of fin is not yet complete  the company believes its accounting and disclosures attributed to its vies has been appropriate 
euro currency conversion as of december   the company changed the functional currency to the euro for its european adhesives operations  consistent with the new business structure 
outlook worldwide political and economic conditions make it difficult to predict the company s financial results 
military action  instability in the world s crude oil and natural gas markets  fluctuations of the us dollar against other major currencies and overall weakness in the global economies all could impact the company s consolidated financial results 
although the company attempts to mitigate the effects of raw material price increases  rising crude oil and natural gas prices may eventually result in higher raw material prices paid by the company and decreases in the consolidated gross profit margin 
management believes the company is well positioned from a cost structure perspective  to leverage sales growth into earnings growth 
the current restructuring initiative  which will be completed in the first half of is expected to result in annual operating savings of million  of which approximately million were realized in therefore  an incremental million is expected in offsetting the restructuring savings will be increased expenses associated with the company s pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
based on the recent performance of the company s asset portfolios attributed to its defined benefit plans  the company reduced its assumption regarding the long term expected return on assets by percentage points and reduced its discount rate assumption by percentage points 
as a result of these changes along with the historical underperformance of asset portfolios versus expected returns  costs associated with the company s pension and other postretirement benefit plans are expected to increase approximately million as compared to forward looking statements and risk factors the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the company is exposed to various market risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign currency rates and prices of raw materials 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk there is exposure to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of borrowing activities used to fund operations 
committed floating rate credit facilities are used to fund a portion of operations 
management believes that probable near term changes in interest rates would not materially affect its consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the annual impact on the results of operations of a one percentage point interest rate change on the outstanding balance of its variable rate debt as of november  would be approximately million 
foreign exchange risk as a result of being a global enterprise  there is exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  which may adversely affect operating results and financial position 
approximately percent of net revenue is generated outside of the united states 
principal foreign currency exposures relate to the euro  british pound sterling  japanese yen  australian dollar  canadian dollar  argentine peso and brazilian real 
management s objective is to balance  where possible  the local currency denominated assets to the local currency denominated liabilities to have a natural hedge and minimize foreign exchange impacts 
the company enters into cross border transactions through importing and exporting goods to and from different countries and locations 
these transactions generate foreign exchange risk as they create assets  liabilities and cash flows in currencies other than the local currency 
this also applies to services provided and other cross border agreements among subsidiaries 
management minimizes risks from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through normal operating and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative instruments 
management does not enter into any speculative positions with regard to derivative instruments 
note and note to the consolidated financial statements provides additional details regarding the management of foreign exchange risk 
from a sensitivity analysis viewpoint  based on financial results a hypothetical overall percent change in the us dollar would have resulted in a change of approximately per diluted share 
raw materials the principal raw materials used to manufacture products include resins  polymers  vinyl acetate monomer  starch  dextrines and natural latex 
the company generally avoids sole source supplier arrangements for raw materials 
while alternate sources for most key raw materials are available  if worldwide supplies were disrupted due to unforeseen events  or if unusual demand causes products to be subject to allocation  shortages could occur 
in  the single largest expenditure was the purchase of raw materials 
management acknowledges that in the long term  prices of most raw materials will probably increase 
management s objective is to purchase raw materials that meet both its quality standards and production needs at the lowest total cost 
most raw materials are purchased on the open market or under contracts which limit the frequency but not the magnitude of price increases 
in some cases  however  the risk of raw material price changes is managed by strategic sourcing agreements which limit price increases to increases in supplier feedstock costs  while requiring decreases as feedstock costs decline 
the company also uses the leverage of having substitute raw materials approved for use wherever possible to minimize the impact of possible price increases
