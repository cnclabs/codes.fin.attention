we currently supplement our on system generating capacity with purchases of capacity and energy from other utilities in order to meet the demands of our customers and the capacity margins applicable to us under current pooling agreements and national electric reliability council rules 
we have contracted with westar energy for the purchase of capacity and energy through may  we also have a short term contract for the purchase of firm energy with american electric power aep from january through march  in  we had similar short term contracts with aep that ran from january through december the amount of capacity purchased under these contracts supplements our on system capacity and contributes to meeting our current expectations of future power needs 
to the extent we do not need such capacity to meet our customers needs  we can sell it in the wholesale market 
the following chart sets forth our purchase commitments and our anticipated owned capacity in megawatts during the indicated contract years which run from june to may of the following year 
we currently expect to purchase additional capacity to meet reserve margins in of to megawatts based on the current forecast of load 
contract year purchased power commitment anticipated owned capacity total does not include aep contracts 
includes capacity from the two ft peaking units scheduled for completion in the second quarter of the charges for capacity purchases under the westar contract referred to above during calendar year amounted to approximately million 
minimum charges for capacity purchases under the westar contract total approximately million for the period june   through may  the maximum hourly demand on our system reached a record high of megawatts on august  our previous record peak of megawatts was established in august a new maximum hourly winter demand of megawatts was set on january  our previous winter peak of megawatts was established on december  construction program total gross property additions including construction work in progress for the three years ended december   amounted to million and retirements during the same period amounted to million 
please refer to item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources for more information 
our total construction related expenditures  including allowance for funds used during construction afudc were million in and for the next three years are estimated for planning purposes including afudc to be as follows estimated construction expenditures amounts in millions total new generating facilities additions to existing generating facilities transmission facilities distribution system additions general and other additions total our projected construction expenditures for new generating facilities include the two ft peaking units to be installed at the empire energy center with generating capacity of megawatts each 
both units have been delivered and are scheduled to be operational in the second quarter of the cost for the purchase  construction and installation of these units was approximately million including afudc in and is estimated to be approximately million including afudc in an initial payment of million was made in when we entered into the purchase agreement for the units 
additions to our transmission and distribution systems to meet projected increases in customer demand constitute the majority of the remainder of the projected construction expenditures for the three year period listed above 
we had originally estimated that our construction expenditures including afudc would total approximately million in  million in and million in these estimates were reduced based on the following factors a missouri commission approved change in policy relating to charging developers for new line construction  which will reduce our costs  an expected change in missouri s epa approved plan for nitrogen oxide nox reduction  which will allow us to delay additional environmentally related construction and a revision of our annual customer growth projections from to based on updated historical growth reflecting lowered economic activity over the next several years  which will allow us to delay construction of additional generation capacity 
we had initially projected additions to existing generating facilities to include million in and million in for the installation of a selective catalytic reduction system at the asbury plant to comply with nitrogen oxide nox emission standards set by the missouri department of natural resources 
however  the anticipated change in missouri s epa approved plan for nox reduction has allowed us to delay this construction 
see environmental matters below for more information 
estimated construction expenditures are reviewed and adjusted for  among other things  revised estimates of future capacity needs  the cost of funds necessary for construction and the availability and cost of alternative power 
actual construction expenditures may vary significantly from the estimates due to a number of factors including changes in equipment delivery schedules  changes in customer requirements  construction delays  ability to raise capital  environmental matters  the extent to which we receive timely and adequate rate increases  the extent of competition from independent power producers and co generators  other changes in business conditions and changes in legislation and regulation  including those relating to the energy industry

fuel coal supplied approximately of our total fuel requirements in based on kilowatt hours generated 
the remainder was supplied by natural gas with oil generation and tire derived fuel tdf  which is produced from discarded passenger car tires  providing less than 
we expect that the amount and percentage of electricity generated by natural gas will increase due to the combined cycle unit at the state line power plant that was placed into commercial operation in june and the addition of the two megawatt ft peaking units currently being installed at the empire energy center and scheduled to be operational by the second quarter of our asbury plant is fueled primarily by coal with oil being used as start up fuel and tdf being used as a supplement fuel 
asbury is currently burning a coal blend consisting of approximately western coal powder river basin and blend coal on a tonnage basis 
our average coal inventory target at asbury is approximately days 
as of december   we had sufficient coal on hand to supply anticipated requirements at asbury for days 
this extra inventory was due to coal contract commitments to purchase a minimum tonnage for the year 
our riverton plant fuel requirements are primarily met by coal with the remainder supplied by natural gas and oil

air 
the amendments to the clean air act  referred to as the amendments  affect the asbury  riverton  state line and iatan power plants and the new ft peaking units at the empire energy center 
the amendments require affected plants to meet certain emission standards  including maximum emission levels for sulfur dioxide so and nitrogen oxide nox 
when a plant becomes an affected unit for a particular emission  it locks in the then current emission standards 
the asbury plant became an affected unit under the amendments for both so and nox on january  the iatan plant became an affected unit for both so and nox on january  the riverton plant became an affected unit for nox in november and for so on january  the state line plant became an affected unit for so and nox on january  the two new ft peaking units at the empire energy center  which are expected to be completed in the second quarter of  will become affected units when they are placed in service 
so emissions 
under the amendments  the amount of so an affected unit can emit is regulated 
each existing affected unit has been awarded a specific number of emission allowances  each of which allows the holder to emit one ton of so utilities covered by the amendments must have emission allowances equal to the number of tons of so emitted during a given year by each of their affected units 
allowances may be traded between plants  utilities or banked for future use 
a market for the trading of emission allowances exists on the chicago board of trade 
the environmental protection agency epa withholds annually a percentage of the emission allowances awarded to each affected unit and sells those emission allowances through a direct auction 
we receive compensation from the epa for the sale of these allowances 
our asbury  riverton and iatan plants currently burn a blend of low sulfur western coal powder river basin and higher sulfur local coal or burn low sulfur western coal 
the state line plant and the new aero units are gas fired facilities and do not receive so allowances 
however  annual allowance requirements for the state line plant and the new ft peaking units  which are not expected to exceed allowances per year  will be transferred from our inventoried bank of allowances 
we anticipate  based on current operations  that the combined actual so allowance need for all affected plant facilities will not exceed the number of allowances awarded to us annually by the epa 
the excess annual so allowances will be transferred to our inventoried bank of allowances 
we currently have  banked allowances 
nox emissions 
the asbury plant is in compliance with current nox requirements 
the iatan  state line  energy center and riverton plants are each in compliance with the nox limits applicable to them under the amendments as currently operated 
the asbury plant  which has a cyclone fired boiler  received permission from the missouri department of natural resources to burn tire derived fuel at a maximum rate of of total fuel input 
during  approximately  tons of tdf were burned 
this is equivalent to  discarded passenger car tires 
in april the missouri department of natural resources promulgated a final rule addressing the ozone moderate non attainment classification of the st 
louis area 
the final regulation  known as the missouri nox rule  set a maximum nox emission rate of lbs mmbtu for eastern missouri and a maximum nox emission rate of lbs mmbtu for western missouri 
the iatan  asbury  state line and energy center facilities are affected by this regulation 
the current compliance date is set for may  the iatan  state line and energy center units  including the new ft peaking units  presently meet this emission limit 
the asbury plant does not 
the missouri nox rule provides for a nox emission trading program and for the generation of early reduction credits ercs during the years  and ercs may be used for compliance during and however  on december  the missouri department of natural resources filed proposed amendments to the missouri nox rule with the missouri secretary of state s office 
approval of these amendments by the missouri air conservation commission is tentatively scheduled for april these amendments include provisions for the delay of compliance with the missouri nox rule until may  also included are amendments to extend erc generation to  erc usage to and a nox limit of lbs mmbtu for cyclone fired boilers burning tdf 
in addition  a law that establishes a nox emission rate during the year of lbs mmbtu for certain boilers burning tdf was passed by the missouri legislature during the legislative session and signed by the governor 
the asbury plant qualifies for the lbs mmbtu nox emission rate 
we are following all regulatory developments and evaluating our options at this time 
nox trading and the purchase of ercs  as described under business construction program  may permit the delay of the installation of major nox controls at asbury until due to the uncertainty of the national regulatory and legislative actions predicted for  it is impossible to accurately forecast estimated compliance costs associated with the various sections of the clean air act amendment under title i of the amendments or to forecast the substance of multi emission legislation that may exempt electric utilities from some or all of the title i programs 
we have operating permits for our state line power plant and have continuously operated in compliance with those permits since they went into operation on may  for unit no 
and june  for unit no 
in july  we received a request for information from the epa regarding the state line power plant 
the information request indicated that the state line power plant units should have an acid rain permit under title iv of the amendments in addition to the construction and operating permits previously issued to us by the missouri department of natural resources 
in response  in august  we applied for the required acid rain permit with the missouri department of natural resources and subsequently received the required permit 
the epa notified us in june that we were subject to being fined approximately  because of the lack of the permit but had the right to request a hearing or a settlement conference 
we had a settlement conference with the epa in july the epa offered to settle if we agreed to a  fine and to undertake a supplemental environmental project with a cost approximating  the supplemental environmental project was physically completed in october and final documentation to conclude this matter was submitted to the epa in november water 
we operate under the kansas and missouri water pollution plans that were implemented in response to the federal water pollution control act amendments of the asbury  iatan  riverton  energy center and state line facilities are in compliance with applicable regulations and have received discharge permits and subsequent renewals as required 
the riverton and state line power plants national pollution discharge elimination system permits were issued in other 
under title v of the amendments  we must obtain site operating permits for each of our plants from the authorities in the state in which the plant is located 
these permits  which are valid for five years  regulate the plant site s total emissions  including emissions from stacks  individual pieces of equipment  road dust  coal dust and steam leaks 
we have been issued permits for asbury  state line and the energy center power plants 
the riverton plant has not been issued an operating permit at this time 
the state of kansas requested that we draft the title v permit and submit it to the state 
the permit has been drafted and submitted 
we expect this permit will be issued during in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets fas establishing standards for accounting and reporting for legal and constructive obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets 
we adopted fas on january   and as a result  have identified a liability for future containment of an ash landfill at the riverton power plant 
the potential cost of this future liability has been estimated as of the settlement date and has been discounted using a credit adjusted risk free rate ranging from to depending on the settlement date 
revisions to this liability could occur due to changes in cost estimates  anticipated timing of settlement or federal or state regulatory requirements 
we estimate the cost of this future containment project to be approximately  conditions respecting financing our indenture of mortgage and deed of trust  dated as of september   as amended and supplemented the mortgage  and our restated articles of incorporation restated articles  specify earnings coverage and other conditions which must be complied with in connection with the issuance of additional first mortgage bonds or cumulative preferred stock  or the incurrence of unsecured indebtedness 
the mortgage contains a requirement that for new first mortgage bonds to be issued  our net earnings as defined in the mortgage for any twelve consecutive months within the months preceding issuance must be two times the annual interest requirements as defined in the mortgage on all first mortgage bonds then outstanding and on the prospective issue of new first mortgage bonds 
our earnings for the twelve months ended december   would permit us to issue approximately million of new first mortgage bonds at an assumed interest rate of based on this test 
the mortgage provides an exception from this earnings requirement in certain instances relating to the issuance of new first mortgage bonds against first mortgage bonds which have been  or are to be  retired 
in addition to the interest coverage requirement  the mortgage provides that new bonds must be issued against  among other things  retired bonds or of net property additions 
at december   we had retired bonds and net property additions which would enable the issuance of at least million principal amount of bonds if the annual interest requirements are met 
under the restated articles  a cumulative preferred stock may be issued only if our net income available for interest and dividends as defined in the restated articles for a specified twelve month period is at least times the sum of the annual interest requirements on all indebtedness and the annual dividend requirements on all cumulative preferred stock to be outstanding immediately after the issuance of such additional shares of cumulative preferred stock  and b so long as any preferred stock is outstanding  the amount of unsecured indebtedness outstanding may not exceed of the sum of the outstanding secured indebtedness plus our capital and surplus 
we redeemed all of our outstanding preferred stock on august  accordingly  the restriction in our restated articles does not currently restrict the amount of unsecured indebtedness that we may have outstanding

the increases in residential and commercial kwh sales in were due primarily to the weather conditions discussed above 
industrial sales and revenues increased  reflecting increased sales in april and during august through november as compared to the same periods in residential  commercial and industrial revenues for were also favorably impacted by the october missouri rate increase and  to a lesser extent  the december missouri rate increase and the july kansas rate increase discussed below 
on system wholesale kwh sales increased reflecting the weather conditions discussed above 
revenues associated with these sales decreased in as compared to as a result of the operation of our fuel adjustment clause applicable to these ferc regulated sales 
this clause permits the pass through to customers of changes in fuel and purchased power costs  which are discussed further below 
kwh sales and revenues for our on system customers increased during as compared to  primarily due to unseasonably cold temperatures in the first quarter of and warmer temperatures during the second quarter of  offset by milder temperatures in the last two quarters of residential and commercial kwh sales and revenues increased compared to due to these weather conditions as well as increases in business activity throughout our service territory 
industrial kwh sales for decreased due to a general slowdown in economic activity by the manufacturing sector in our service territory during the third and fourth quarters of revenues in these classes were favorably impacted by the october missouri rate increase 
on system wholesale kwh sales increased in  reflecting the weather conditions discussed above 
revenues associated with these sales increased more than the corresponding kwh sales as a result of the operation of our fuel adjustment clause applicable to these ferc regulated sales 
our future revenues from the sale of electricity will continue to be affected by economic conditions  weather  business activities  competition  fuel costs  changes in electric rate levels  customer growth and changes in patterns of electric energy use by customers and our ability to receive adequate and timely rate relief 
rate matters the following table sets forth information regarding electric and water rate increases affecting the revenue comparisons discussed above jurisdiction date requested annual increase requested annual increase granted percent increase granted date missouri electric missouri electric missouri water kansas electric on november   we filed a request with the missouri commission for a general annual increase in base rates for our missouri electric customers in the amount of  or 
the missouri commission issued a final order on september  granting us an annual increase in rates of approximately million  or  effective october  in addition  the order approved an annual interim energy charge  or iec  of approximately million effective october  and expiring two years later 
this iec was collected subject to refund with interest at the end of the two year period to the extent money was collected from customers above the greater of the actual and prudently incurred costs or the base cost of fuel and purchased power set in rates 
on march   we filed a request with the missouri commission for an annual increase in base rates for our missouri electric customers in the amount of  and also asked to have the iec put into effect in the last rate case reconfigured to reflect a decrease of  in the amount to be billed to customers 
the reconfigured iec would remain subject to refund with interest 
this request sought to recover new operating costs and obligations and reflect the changes in our capital structure since the rate increase in october also on march   we filed an interim rate case for an annual increase in base rates of  the amount that was erroneously omitted from the increase granted in our rate case 
the missouri commission rejected the interim request 
after extensive negotiations with the missouri commission staff  office of public counsel and other intervening parties  we filed a unanimous stipulation and agreement regarding error in the rate case and an immediate reduction of the iec with the missouri commission on may  this agreement was approved by the missouri commission on june  and provided for a million annual reduction in the iec 
on october   we filed a unanimous stipulation and agreement  agreed to by the missouri commission staff  office of public counsel and other intervening parties  with the missouri commission 
this agreement was approved by the missouri commission on november  and settled all matters covered by our march filings  provided us with an annual increase in rates of approximately million  or  effective december  and eliminated the iec as of that date 
the agreement also calls for us to refund all funds collected under the iec  with interest  by march  at december   we had recorded a current liability of approximately million for such rate refunds 
we collected million in and recorded million as revenue 
we collected million in and recorded a revenue reduction of million associated with the revenue recognized in because it became certain that the entire amount of iec revenues collected would be refunded 
as a result  we have recognized no revenue in the aggregate for combined and associated with the iec collections 
the remainder of the funds collected in and were set aside as a provision for rate refunds and not recognized in operating revenue 
as a result of the non recognition of these funds  the refunds have already been reflected in our results except for million of interest and will have no material impact on our earnings in the agreement also provided for a change to the summer winter rate differential for our residential customers with the new rates reflecting a smaller differential between summer and winter rates for usage above kilowatt hours 
each of the parties to the agreement also agreed not to file a new request for a general rate increase or decrease before september   barring any unforeseen  extraordinary occurrences 
on may   we filed a request with the missouri commission for an annual increase in base rates for our missouri water customers in the amount of approximately  or 
this was the first requested increase in rates for our water customers since on november   we filed an agreement regarding disposition of a small company rate increase request  agreed to by the commission staff  with the missouri commission 
this agreement was approved by the missouri commission effective december  and provides us with an annual increase in rates of approximately  or 
on december   we filed a request with the kansas corporation commission kcc for an annual increase in base rates for our kansas electric customers in the amount of  or 
this request sought to recover costs associated with our investment in state line unit no 
 state line unit no 
and the state line combined cycle unit slcc  as well as significant additions to our transmission and distribution systems and operating cost increases which had occurred since our last rate increase in september we also requested reinstatement of a fuel adjustment clause for our kansas rates 
we filed a unanimous stipulation and agreement  agreed to by the kcc staff and all intervening parties  with the kcc on june  the agreement stipulates that we will not file for general rate relief before november  barring any unforeseen  extraordinary occurrences 
this agreement was approved by the kcc on june  providing us an annual increase in rates of approximately  or  effective july  it did not provide for the reinstatement of a fuel adjustment clause 
on march   we filed a request with the oklahoma corporation commission for an annual increase in base rates for our oklahoma electric customers in the amount of  or 
we are currently discussing an increase in rates with our on system wholesale electric customers  and will make a ferc rate filing in we will continue to assess the need for rate relief in all of the jurisdictions we serve and file for such relief when necessary 
off system transactions in addition to sales to our own customers  we sell power to other utilities as available and provide transmission service through our system for transactions between other energy suppliers 
during revenues from such off system transactions were approximately million as compared to approximately million in and approximately million during the increase in revenues during resulted primarily from the availability of competitively priced power from our slcc which was placed in service in june and term purchases of firm energy during which  when not required to meet our own customers needs  could be sold in the wholesale market 
revenues for were less than for primarily because of our peak hour market based rates being substantially lower during the summer months of than in and milder regional weather conditions in the fourth quarter of affecting demand 
see competition below 
operating revenue deductions during  total operating expenses increased approximately million compared to the prior year 
total purchased power costs increased by approximately million during although the amount of power purchased increased  reflecting increased demand in the second and third quarters of and the term purchases of firm energy previously discussed 
purchased power costs reflected lower purchased power prices in than in total fuel costs decreased approximately million during as compared to primarily reflecting lower natural gas prices in as well as less generation by our gas fired units due in large part to the term purchases of firm energy 
natural gas costs on a per mmbtu basis were lower by during than in this is a result of a combination of lower commodity prices during and our natural gas procurement program 
expenses relating to the proposed merger with aquila  inc  formerly utilicorp united inc which was terminated by utilicorp on january  were million during as compared to million in expenses related to the terminated merger in both and were primarily the result of expenses related to severance benefits incurred under our change in control severance pay plan in the first quarters of those years 
see note to notes to financial statements for more information on the terminated merger 
other operating expenses increased approximately million during primarily due to increases of million in administrative and general expense resulting from increased expense for employee health care and benefit plans and decreased pension income  million in transmission expense for the delivery of purchased energy to our system and million in other power operation expenses related to a full year of operation of the slcc 
we anticipate significantly lower pension income in expense related to our non regulated businesses increased approximately million during as compared to see non regulated items below for more information 
maintenance and repairs expense increased approximately million during expenditures under long term maintenance contracts that serve to levelize maintenance costs over time and are reflected in our rates that became effective in october  accounted for million of this increase of which million was for the maintenance contracts that began in january for the energy center and state line unit no 
and million was for the first full year of these contracts for the slcc  which commenced operations in june maintenance costs associated with a three week outage to replace the main transformer at the asbury plant during the second quarter of also contributed to this increase 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased approximately million during due to lower depreciation rates put into effect during the fourth quarter of as a result of the october missouri rate order 
total provision for income taxes increased approximately million during due primarily to higher taxable income and the benefit created by the deductibility of approximately million in merger related expenses in the first quarter of as a result of the termination of the proposed merger with aquila  inc in january see note of notes to financial statements under item for additional information regarding income taxes 
other taxes increased approximately million during as compared to primarily due to a reduction in capitalized property taxes related to the slcc being placed in service in june during  total operating expenses increased approximately million compared to the prior year 
total purchased power costs decreased by approximately million during reflecting both the decreased demand in the third and fourth quarters resulting from milder temperatures and the increased generating capability due to the completion of the slcc 
total fuel costs were up approximately million during as compared to primarily reflecting the higher cost of natural gas  increased generation from the slcc in the third and fourth quarters and less coal generation due to our asbury plant being out of service for scheduled and unscheduled repairs and maintenance during weeks late in the year 
natural gas prices on a per mmbtu basis were higher by during as compared to merger related expenses were million during as compared to million in other operating expenses increased approximately million during primarily due to an actuarially determined adjustment to our fully funded pension benefit expense in the first quarter of  decreased income of approximately million from the pension fund caused by a decline in the value of invested funds during and additions to the bad debt reserve of approximately million during maintenance and repairs expense increased approximately million during primarily due to initial operation of the slcc and subsequent payments under our long term maintenance contracts entered into in july for the slcc combustion turbines 
depreciation and amortization expense increased approximately million during due to increased levels of plant and equipment placed in service 
this increase was partially offset by lower depreciation rates put into effect during the fourth quarter of as a result of the october missouri rate order 
total provision for income taxes decreased approximately million during due primarily to lower taxable income and by the deductibility in of approximately million in merger related expenses discussed above 
other taxes increased approximately million during the year 
non regulated items in  we began recording revenue from our non regulated business in non regulated under operating revenues and including expense from such business in non regulated under the operating revenue deductions section of our income statements rather than netting them under other net in the other income and deductions section  as we had done in prior periods 
we have reclassified the non regulated revenues and expenses for prior periods to conform to the new presentations 
prior period amounts reclassified are not material to the results of operations for those periods 
during  total non regulated operating revenue increased approximately million while total non regulated operating expense increased approximately million compared with the increase in both revenues and expenses was primarily due to the consolidation of the financial statements of mid america precision products  llc mapp  which was acquired in july mapp specializes in close tolerance custom manufacturing for the aerospace  electronics  telecommunications and machinery industries  including components for specialized batteries for eagle picher technologies 
the increase in expense was also due to the activities of our wholly owned subsidiary  conversant  inc  a software company that began business in early conversant markets the internet based customer information system software formerly named centurion that was developed by empire employees 
in december  we sold our monitored security business  e watch  to federal protection  inc of springfield  missouri after it did not meet our earnings expectations 
this sale did not have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
on february  we purchased joplin 
com  a leading internet service provider in the joplin  missouri area 
the purchase was made through transaeris  a non regulated subsidiary of ede holdings  inc we are merging transaeris and joplin 
com into one company named fast freedom  inc we began investing in non regulated businesses in and now lease capacity on our fiber optics network and provide internet access  utility industry technical training  close tolerance custom manufacturing  surge suppressors and other energy services through our wholly owned subsidiary  ede holdings  inc see item  business general for further information about these non regulated businesses 
nonoperating items total allowance for funds used during construction afudc decreased million in and million in reflecting the completion of the slcc in june see note of notes to financial statements under item other net deductions decreased million during primarily reflecting a million unrealized gain on derivatives in december as compared to a million loss in the second and third quarters of this loss was caused by the marking to market  required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities of option contracts entered into in connection with our hedging activities that did not qualify for hedge accounting 
the million unrealized gain on derivatives resulted from anticipated natural gas usage that was financially hedged but no longer necessary because we were able to purchase power in the wholesale market more economically than generating it ourselves 
as a result of our use of derivatives to manage our gas commodity risk and our exposure to gas and purchased power cost volatility including hedging and the use of mark to market accounting  revenues and earnings may fluctuate 
although our purpose is to minimize our risk from volatile natural gas prices and protect earnings  we recognize that if risk is not timely and adequately balanced or if counterparties fail to perform contractual obligations  actual results could differ materially from intended results 
a one time write down of million was taken in the third quarter of for disallowed capital costs related to the construction of the slcc 
these costs were disallowed as part of the stipulated agreement approved by the missouri commission in connection with our rate case and will not be recovered in rates 
the net effect on earnings after considering the tax effect on this write down was million 
total interest charges on long term debt decreased million in as compared to mainly due to the maturing of million of our first mortgage bonds in july total interest charges on long term debt were virtually the same for as for commercial paper interest decreased million during reflecting decreased usage of short term debt as well as lower interest rates 
interest related to our trust preferred securities issued on march  increased million during reflecting twelve months of interest as compared to the ten months in interest income decreased million  reflecting the lower interest rates 
other comprehensive income the change in the fair market value of open contracts related to our gas procurement program and the amount of the contracts settled during the period being reported  including the tax effect of these items  are included in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income as the net change in unrealized gain or loss 
this net change is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in the capitalization section of our balance sheet and does not affect earnings per share 
the unrealized gains and losses accumulated in comprehensive income are reclassified to fuel expense in the periods in which they are actually realized 
we had a net change in unrealized gain loss of million at the end of as compared to a net change of million at the end of  the first year we recorded such contracts 
earnings basic and diluted earnings per weighted average share of common stock were during compared to in this increase in earnings per share was primarily due to the october and december missouri rate increases  the july kansas rate increase  lower fuel and purchased power prices  an increase in off system sales and decreased depreciation expense 
also favorably impacting earnings were cooler temperatures in april and the fourth quarter and warmer temperatures in june and september as compared to the same periods in and the million unrealized gain on derivatives in december earnings per share for were negatively impacted by million in merger related expenses as well as planned increased maintenance costs for our combustion turbine and combined cycle units 
excluding the million in merger related expenses and related taxes  earnings per share would have been during earnings for included approximately million  after taxes  resulting from the tax benefit occurring because we recognized approximately million of merger related expenses upon the termination of the proposed merger with aquila  inc in january excluding million in merger costs million net of taxes for  million  net of related income taxes  from the write down of the state line construction expenditures and the one time tax benefit  earnings per share would have been in the calculation of our earnings per share for also gives effect to the sale in underwritten public offerings of million shares of our common stock in december and million shares in may see liquidity and capital resources below 
basic and diluted earnings per weighted average share of common stock were during compared to in earnings per share for were negatively impacted by the mild weather in the third and fourth quarters  increased natural gas prices and greater use of gas than in the prior year and the one time non cash charge of million  net of related income taxes  from the write down of the slcc construction expenditures 
positively impacting earnings in was the one time tax benefit of approximately million from previously incurred merger related costs and favorable weather conditions in the first and second quarters of our actual net income and basic and diluted earnings per share are determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the earnings per share amounts described above that exclude merger expenses  the one time tax benefit and the write down of construction expenditures and the corresponding adjusted net income amounts are non gaap measures 
these non gaap measures are presented because we believe they provide a more accurate picture of our underlying financial performance 
the following table provides a reconciliation of the differences between net income and basic and diluted earnings per share  as determined in accordance with gaap  and these non gaap measures twelve months ended december  net income merger expenses net of income taxes for and net loss from state line combined cycle plant disallowance tax benefit from merger expenses net income excluding merger expenses  disallowance and tax benefit weighted average common shares outstanding basic and diluted earnings per share merger expenses per share net of income taxes net loss per share from state line combined cycle plant disallowance tax benefit per share from merger expenses basic and diluted earnings per share excluding merger expenses  disallowance and tax benefit competition federal regulation has promoted and is expected to continue to promote competition in the electric utility industry 
however  none of the states in our service territory has legislation that could require competitive pricing to be put into effect 
the arkansas legislature passed a bill in april that called for deregulation of the state s electricity industry as early as january however  a law was passed in february repealing deregulation in the state of arkansas 
we  and all other electric utilities with interstate transmission facilities  operate under ferc regulated open access tariffs that offer all wholesale buyers and sellers of electricity the same transmission services at the same rates that the utilities provide themselves 
we are a member of the southwest power pool spp  a regional division of the north american electric reliability council 
effective september   we began taking network integration transmission service under the spp s open access transmission tariff 
this provides a cost effective way for us to participate in a broader market of generation resources with the possibility of lower transmission costs 
this tariff provides for a zonal rate structure  whereby transmission customers pay a pro rata share  in the form of a reservation charge  for the use of the facilities for each transmission owner that serves them 
currently  all revenues collected within a zone are allocated back to the transmission owner serving the zone 
since we are a transmission provider for our zone and are currently the only transmission customer taking service from that zone  we are currently being assessed per cent of the zonal costs and receiving it back as revenue 
to the extent that we are incurring these revenues and charges to serve our on system wholesale and retail power customers  the associated costs are netted against the revenues collected and only the difference  if any  is recorded 
in  these total transmission costs and the associated revenues were approximately million 
in the event that other transmission customers take network integration transmission service in our zone  the revenues received will be reflected in electric operating revenues and the related charges will be expensed 
in december  the ferc issued order no 
which encourages the development of rtos 
rtos are designed to control the wholesale transmission services of the utilities in their regions thereby facilitating open and more competitive markets in bulk power 
after the ferc rejected several attempts by the spp to seek rto status  the spp and midwest independent transmission system operator  inc miso agreed in october to consolidate and form an rto 
in december  the ferc approved this newly formed miso as the first rto 
the agreement to consolidate was completed in february miso filed the necessary documents with the ferc on march  and the consolidation is still in progress 
this new organization would operate our system as part of an interconnected transmission system encompassing over  megawatts of generation capacity located in states 
miso would collect revenues attributable to the use of each member s transmission system and each member would be able to transmit power purchased  generated for sale or bought for resale in the wholesale market throughout the entire miso system 
miso and spp filed a combined tariff for the new resulting company on november  as directed by the ferc 
this new tariff would eliminate rate pancaking for transactions that occur between miso and spp customers  preserve the zonal rate structure under the current miso and spp tariffs  preserve the existing rates for certain long term firm spp service agreements  preserve the grandfathered contract provisions under both organizations tariffs and continue the stated rates currently on file under the spp tariff 
the ferc conditionally accepted the filing on december  we have filed with the ferc and the utility commissions in the four states in which we operate to transfer control over the operation of our transmission facilities to miso 
the kansas corporation commission and the ferc have approved our requests while the filings in missouri and arkansas are still pending 
although we were not required to file in oklahoma  we did a courtesy filing for informational purposes 
if  however  the consolidation does not occur  we may operate our transmission separately while continuing to search for an rto to join 
we are unable to quantify the potential impact of either joining or not joining an rto on our future financial position  results of operation or cash flows 
approximately of our electric operating revenues are derived from sales to on system wholesale customers  the type of customer for which the ferc is already requiring wheeling 
our two largest wholesale customers accounted for of our wholesale business in we have contracts with these customers that run through the first quarter of liquidity and capital resources our construction related expenditures  including afudc  totaled approximately million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
a breakdown of these construction expenditures for is as follows construction expenditures amounts in millions distribution and transmission system additions ft peaking units energy center additions and replacements asbury additions and replacements riverton  iatan and ozark beach additions and replacements slcc combustor system upgrade sl fiber optics non regulated computer services projects general and other additions total approximately of construction expenditures for were satisfied internally from operations 
the other of such requirements were satisfied from short term borrowings and proceeds from our sales of common stock and unsecured senior notes discussed below 
we estimate that our construction expenditures  including afudc  will total approximately million in  million in and million in of these amounts  we anticipate that we will spend million  million and million in  and  respectively  for additions to our distribution system to meet projected increases in customer demand 
these construction expenditure estimates also include approximately million in for two ft peaking units at the empire energy center 
in october  we entered into an agreement to purchase these two ft peaking units  each having generating capacity of megawatts 
both units have been delivered and are scheduled to be operational in the second quarter of we estimate that the cost of both of these units will be approximately million  excluding afudc 
our net cash flows provided by operating activities increased million during as compared to due mainly to a million increase in net income and a million increase in the amount of the iec collected from missouri electric customers 
the refund of this iec which totals million during the first quarter of will have a material impact on our cash flows for the quarter although it will not have a material impact on earnings per share due to the non recognition of these funds as operating revenue 
our net cash flows used in investing activities decreased million during as compared to because of decreased construction expenditures due mainly to the completion of the slcc in june our net cash flows provided by financing activities decreased million during as compared to mainly due to the repayment of million of our first mortgage bonds due july  and the repayment of million of short term debt in as compared to million in we sold common stock in may and december  senior notes in december and trust preferred securities in march as described below 
the proceeds from such sales in totaled million more than the proceeds from the sales 
we estimate that internally generated funds will provide at least of the funds required in for construction expenditures 
as in the past  we intend to utilize short term debt to finance the additional amounts needed for such construction and repay such borrowings with the proceeds of sales of long term debt or common stock including common stock sold under our employee stock purchase plan  our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan  and our k plan and esop and internally generated funds 
we will continue to utilize short term debt as needed to support normal operations or other temporary requirements 
the estimates herein may be changed because of changes we make in our construction program  unforeseen construction costs  our ability to obtain financing  regulation and for other reasons 
on march   we sold two million of trust preferred securities in a public underwritten offering 
this sale generated proceeds of million and issuance costs of million 
holders of the trust preferred securities are entitled to receive distributions at an annual rate of of the liquidation amount 
quarterly payments of dividends by the trust which issued the securities  as well as payments of principal  are made from cash received from corresponding payments made by us on million aggregate principal amount of our junior subordinated debentures due march   issued by us to the trust  and held by the trust as assets 
our interest payments on the debentures are tax deductible by us 
we have effectively guaranteed the payments due on the outstanding trust preferred securities 
the net proceeds of this offering were added to our general funds and were used to repay short term indebtedness 
on december   we sold to the public in an underwritten offering  newly issued shares of our common stock for million 
the net proceeds of approximately million from the sale were added to our general funds and used to repay short term debt 
on may  we entered into a day  unsecured revolving credit facility 
this credit facility replaced all of our existing lines of credit 
the facility is used for working capital  general corporate purposes and to back up our use of commercial paper 
this facility requires our total indebtedness which does not include the trust preferred securities to be less than of our total capitalization at the end of each fiscal quarter and our ebitda defined as net income plus interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and certain other non cash charges to be at least two times our interest charges which includes distributions on the trust preferred securities for the trailing four fiscal quarters at the end of each fiscal quarter 
failure to maintain these ratios will result in an event of default under the credit facility and will prohibit us from borrowing funds thereunder 
we are in compliance with these ratios 
this credit facility is also subject to cross default with our other indebtedness in excess of  in the aggregate 
there are no borrowings outstanding under this revolver as of december  however  million of the facility as of that date was used to back up our commercial paper and was not available to be borrowed 
see note of notes to financial statements regarding our lines of credit 
on may   we sold to the public in an underwritten offering  shares of newly issued common stock for million 
the net proceeds of approximately million were used to repay million of our first mortgage bonds  series due july  and to repay short term debt 
on july  our subsidiary  ede holdings  inc  together with other investors  acquired the assets of the precision products department of eagle picher technologies  llc 
the acquisition was accomplished through the creation of a newly formed limited liability company  mid america precision products  llc mapp 
ede holdings  inc acquired a controlling percent interest in mapp through a cash investment of million and is the guarantor for of a million long term note payable and a million revolving short term credit facility 
on december   we sold to the public in an underwritten offering million of our unsecured senior notes which mature on december  the net proceeds of approximately million were added to our general funds and used to repay short term debt 
we have an effective shelf registration under which approximately million of common stock and unsecured debt securities remain available for issuance 
on december   we received approval from the kansas corporation commission for the issuance of an additional  shares of our common stock for our director s stock unit plan and an additional  shares of our common stock for our k plan and esop 
restrictions in our mortgage bond indenture could affect our liquidity 
the mortgage contains a requirement that for new first mortgage bonds to be issued  our net earnings as defined in the mortgage for any twelve consecutive months within the fifteen months preceding issuance must be two times the annual interest requirements as defined in the mortgage on all first mortgage bonds then outstanding and on the prospective issue of new first mortgage bonds 
our earnings for the twelve months ended december  would permit us to issue approximately million of new first mortgage bonds based on this test with an assumed interest rate of 
the mortgage provides an exception from this earnings requirement in certain instances  relating to the issuance of new first mortgage bonds against first mortgage bonds which have been  or are to be  retired 
we have no plans to issue any first mortgage bonds 
see note to notes to financial statements for more information on the mortgage bond indenture 
moody s investors service currently rates our first mortgage bonds other than the pollution control bonds baa and our senior unsecured debt baa standard poor s downgraded our first mortgage bonds other than the pollution control bonds on july  from a to bbb  our senior unsecured debt from bbb to bbb and our trust preferred securities from bbb to bb 
standard poor s outlook  however  was revised from negative to stable 
in july  moody s adjusted the credit rating of our trust preferred securities from baa to baa due to technical changes in moody s methodology for rating this classification of security 
as of december   the ratings for our securities were as follows moody s standard poor s first mortgage bonds baa bbb first mortgage bonds pollution control series aaa aaa senior notes baa bbb commercial paper p a trust preferred securities baa bb these ratings indicate the agencies assessment of our ability to pay interest  distributions  dividends and principal on these securities 
the lower the rating the higher the cost of the securities when they are sold 
ratings below investment grade baa or above for moody s and bbb or above for standard poor s may also impair our ability to issue short term debt as described above  commercial paper or other securities or make the marketing of such securities more difficult

off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
critical accounting policies set forth below are certain accounting policies that are considered by management to be critical and to possibly involve significant risk  which means that they typically require difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain other accounting policies may also require assumptions that could cause actual results to be different than anticipated results 
a change in assumptions or judgments applied in determining the following matters  among others  could have a material impact on future financial results 
pensions 
our pension expense or benefit includes amortization of previously unrecognized net gains or losses 
the amortized amount represents the average of gains and losses over the prior five years  with this amount being amortized over five years 
our policy is consistent with the provisions of sfas  employers accounting for pensions 
risks and uncertainties affecting the application of this accounting policy include future rate of return on plan assets  interest rates used in valuing benefit obligations and discount rates 
postretirement benefits 
we recognize expense related to postretirement benefits as earned during the employee s period of service 
related assets and liabilities are established based upon the funded status of the plan compared to the accumulated benefit obligation 
our policy is consistent with the provisions of sfas  employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
risks and uncertainties affecting the application of this accounting policy include future rate of return on plan assets  interest rates used in valuing benefit obligations  healthcare cost trend rates and discount rates 
hedging activities 
we currently engage in hedging activities in an effort to minimize our risk from volatile natural gas prices 
we enter into contracts with counterparties relating to our future natural gas requirements under a set of predetermined percentages that lock in prices in an attempt to lessen the volatility in our fuel expense and gain predictability  thus protecting earnings 
we recognize that if risk is not timely and adequately balanced or if counterparties fail to perform contractual obligations  actual results could differ materially from intended results 
all derivative instruments are recognized on the balance sheet with gains and losses from effective instruments deferred in other comprehensive income in stockholders equity  while gains and losses from ineffective instruments are recognized as the fair value of the derivative instrument changes 
our policy is consistent with the provisions of sfas  accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  an amendment of sfas as of february   of our anticipated volume of natural gas usage for the remainder of year is hedged at an average price of per dekatherm dth 
in addition  approximately of our anticipated volume of natural gas usage for the year is hedged at an average price of per dth  and approximately of our anticipated volume of natural gas usage for the year is hedged at an average price of per dth 
risks and uncertainties affecting the application of this accounting policy include market conditions in the energy industry  especially the effects of price volatility on contractual commodity commitments  regulatory and political environments and requirements  fair value estimations on longer term contracts  estimating underlying fuel demand and counterparty ability to perform 
regulatory assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  our financial statements reflect ratemaking policies prescribed by the regulatory commissions having jurisdiction over us ferc and four states 
certain expenses and credits  normally recognized as incurred  are deferred as assets and liabilities on the balance sheet until the time they are recovered from or refunded to customers 
this is consistent with the provisions of sfas no 
we have recorded certain regulatory assets which are expected to result in future revenues as these costs are recovered through the ratemaking process 
historically  all costs of this nature which are determined by our regulators to have been prudently incurred have been recoverable through rates in the course of normal ratemaking procedures  and we believe that the regulatory assets and liabilities we have recorded will be afforded similar treatment 
as of december   we have recorded  in regulatory assets and  in income taxes as a regulatory liability 
these amounts are being amortized over periods of up to years

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the exposure to a change in the value of a physical asset or financial instrument  derivative or non derivative  caused by fluctuations in market variables such as interest rates or commodity prices 
wehandle market risk in accordance with established policies  which may include entering into various derivative transactions 
during the second quarter of  we began utilizing derivatives to manage our gas commodity market risk and to help manage our exposure resulting from purchasing most of our natural gas on the volatile spot market for the generation of power for our native load customers 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
interest rate risk 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of significant financing through our issuance of commercial paper 
we manage our interest rate exposure by limiting our variable rate exposure to a certain percentage of total capitalization  as set by policy  and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates 
see notes and of notes to financial statements under item for further information 
if market interest rates average more in than in  our interest expense would increase  and income before taxes would decrease by approximately  this amount has been determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our commercial paper balances as of december  these analyses do not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
in the event of a significant change in interest rates  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in our financial structure 
commodity price risk 
we are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price and transportation costs of coal  natural gas  and electricity and employ established policies and procedures to manage the risks associated with these market fluctuations
