item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations tabular dollars in millions the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this document 
general blockbuster inc is the world s leading provider of rentable home movies and video games  with over  stores in the united states  its territories and other countries as of december  during  in order to take advantage of increasing consumer interest in retail product  in particular dvds  we capitalized on the consumer traffic generated by our rental business  as well as our expansive store base to enhance our position in the retail market 
in addition  during  our rental business continued to grow  reflecting our ability also to take advantage of the growing popularity of the dvd format as a rental product 
the growth in our rental business also reflects increased maximization of our investment in rental product through sales of previously rented product 
our strategy to capitalize on both rental and retail opportunities resulted in revenues for of billion  driven by growth in dvd and game revenues 
consumer demand for dvds continued to increase in according to estimates of kagan world media  a primedia company  the number of us dvd households increased from of us television households in to nearly of us television households by the end of  and us dvd retail and rental revenues increased by in from reflecting this continuing growth trend in the dvd industry  our dvd rental revenues more than doubled in from  representing of our total rental revenues in as compared with in the growth in the dvd industry has also resulted in increased competition from retailers such as mass merchant retailers 
in particular  during the fourth quarter of  our movie rental business was negatively impacted due to reductions in dvd pricing by mass merchant retailers during the holiday season 
despite this increased competition  our dvd rental margin in continued to be higher than our vhs rental margin 
the growth in the dvd industry was also reflected in growth in our overall movie merchandise sales 
during  we increased our focus on the sale of new movies to complement our rental offering and to accommodate the increased demand for retail product 
as a result of this new focus  we expanded the selection in our stores for dvd 
we also sought to take advantage of our ability to offer promotions that combine movie rentals with sales of popular retail titles  thereby providing an alternative to the offerings provided by a traditional retailer 
as a result  our dvd merchandise sales more than doubled in from overall  we expect our rental and retail dvd revenues to increase in compared with the retail home video game industry has traditionally been affected by changing technology  short hardware and software lifecycles  frequent introduction of new products and the popularity  price and timing of new hardware platforms and software titles 
three new game platforms were introduced to the market in and the introduction of the new game platforms and games associated with the new game platforms began to have a positive impact on our game rental revenues in the fourth quarter of and continued during our game rental revenues increased from to and increased as a percentage of total rental revenues from in to in during  we also increased our focus on the sale of games to 
table of contents complement our rental games business and to accommodate the increased demand for retail games 
as a result of this new focus  we expanded the selection in our stores for video games 
this led to an increase in our game merchandise sales  which more than quadrupled in from critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to the revenues generated by customer programs and incentives  revenues generated by multiple element transactions  useful lives and residual values of our rental library  accruals related to revenue sharing titles subject to performance guarantees  merchandise inventory reserves  income taxes  impairment of our goodwill  impairment of our long lived assets other than goodwill and indefinite lived identifiable intangible assets and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our accounting policies are generally straightforward 
we believe the following accounting policies  among others  require our more significant judgments and estimates 
revenue recognition rental revenues and merchandise sales are generally recognized at the time of rental or sale 
rental revenues are generated from the rental of vhs tapes  dvds  video games and from any eventual sale of previously rented vhs tapes  dvds and video games 
revenues generated from rental transactions include revenues received in connection with the initial rentals of product  as well as revenues associated with any continuations of such rentals past the initial rental period  as contemplated by our membership agreement 
under our convenience policy  which we implemented in february  a customer pays for the initial rental at the time the product is rented and agrees to pay for any continuation of the rental beyond the initial rental period 
generally  when a customer elects to keep rental product beyond the initial rental period  the customer s rental is successively continued for the same number of days and at the same price as the initial rental period  until such point as the product is purchased under the terms of the membership agreement or is returned 
a provision for sales returns and allowances on our merchandise sales is estimated based on historical trends and recorded at the time of sale 
due to the nature of the products that we sell  sales returns and allowances are minimal 
during  we offered various rental passes  which allowed customers to rent an unlimited number of specified items during the term of the pass  subject to a limit of the number of items that could be taken at one time 
items could be returned at any time during the term of the pass 
we recognized rental revenues for these passes ratably over the term of the pass 
we have agreements with certain companies that allow these companies to purchase free rental cards from us  which can then be awarded at their discretion 
we analyze our historical redemption rates for similar award programs as a basis for the estimate of the rentals that will not be redeemed on a program by program basis 
we defer revenue for the estimated number of free rental cards that will ultimately be redeemed and recognize the amount deferred as revenue upon redemption 
revenue for estimated non redemptions is generally recognized when the cards are sold 
if the actual number of free rentals redeemed is significantly different than our estimate  an adjustment to the revenue recorded in a particular period may be required 
blockbuster s premium membership program is designed to enhance customer loyalty by encouraging customers to rent movies only from blockbuster 
for an annual fee  a customer can join the blockbuster rewards program and earn free movie or video game rentals 
the fee is recognized ratably as revenue over the membership period 

table of contents from time to time  we sell multiple goods and or services as a bundled package 
we allocate revenue under such arrangements based on the fair value of each element  to the extent objectively determinable  and recognize revenue upon delivery or consummation of the separable earnings process attributable to each element 
rental library amortization we amortize the cost of our rental library  which includes vhs tapes  dvds and video games  over periods ranging from three months to twelve months to an estimated residual value ranging from to per unit  according to the product category 
we continually evaluate the estimates surrounding the useful lives and residual values used in amortizing our rental library 
changes to these estimates resulting from changes in consumer demand may impact the carrying value of our rental library and our rental margins 
for instance  during and  consumers increased their rentals of dvds  while their demand for vhs rental product declined 
as a result  we shifted our product mix within our stores toward a much higher proportion of dvds  while we reduced the proportion of vhs product 
in addition  new game platforms significantly decreased consumer demand for games formatted for older game platforms 
we also shifted our mix of game products by increasing the proportion of games made for newer game platforms and decreasing the proportion of games made for older game platforms 
accordingly  and as discussed in notes and to our consolidated financial statements  we changed our estimates regarding useful lives and residual values for vhs products and game products in  which resulted in increased amortization expense during merchandise inventory our merchandise inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market 
we include an allocation of costs incurred in our distribution center to prepare products for our stores in the cost of our merchandise inventory 
we record adjustments to the value of inventory primarily for estimated obsolete or excess inventory equal to the difference between the carrying value of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if future demand or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory adjustments may be required 
our accrual for shrink is based on the actual historical shrink results of our most recent physical inventories adjusted  if necessary  for current economic conditions 
these estimates are compared with actual results as physical inventory counts are taken and reconciled to the general ledger 
during and  our shrink has increased with the introduction and increased demand for dvd product and with our increased presence as a video game retailer 
dvd and video game products are more susceptible to shrink due to their portability and popularity 
we continue to design and implement controls at our stores to lower our shrink results  especially in relation to our dvd and video game products 
tax valuation allowances we record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that our estimates regarding future taxable income  or the results of our tax planning strategies differ from actual results  we would adjust our deferred tax assets with an offsetting amount recorded to our income tax provision in the period such determination was made 
the tax matters agreement dated august  between us and viacom required us to surrender all or a portion of our united kingdom tax loss carryovers generated by us to viacom upon request without compensation 
as noted below  and in note to our consolidated financial statements  during the third quarter of  viacom notified us that the conditions pursuant to which viacom could require us to surrender tax loss carryovers were no longer applicable and  therefore  viacom would not request us to surrender our united kingdom tax loss carryovers 
accordingly  we reduced the valuation allowance by million as it is now more likely than not that these tax loss carryovers will be utilized in the future 
in  we determined because of our continued and projected profitability in mexico that our net operating losses generated in the past 
table of contents in mexico would more likely than not be utilized 
accordingly  during the fourth quarter of  we reduced the valuation allowance related to our net operating loss carryforwards attributed to mexico by million 
goodwill impairment through december   our goodwill and intangible assets were stated at historical cost less accumulated amortization 
we amortized goodwill on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the goodwill  not exceeding years  and identifiable intangibles  over the estimated life of the asset  not exceeding years 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  including such assets recorded in past business combinations  no longer be amortized to earnings but instead be tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value below its carrying amount 
in addition  sfas requires that the impairment test be performed through the application of a fair value test  as opposed to the undiscounted cash flow approach used by us to evaluate impairment under the previous guidance 
the initial adoption of sfas required us to perform a two step fair value based goodwill impairment test 
the first step of the test compared the book values of our reporting units to their estimated fair values 
the estimated fair values of the reporting units were computed using the present value of future cash flows as of the date of adoption 
in the second step of the goodwill impairment test  we compared the implied fair value of goodwill  in accordance with the methodology prescribed by sfas  to our net book value 
as a result of performing the two step test  we determined that our goodwill balance was impaired resulting in a charge of billion during the first quarter of the impairment charge has been recorded as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax  in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  subsequently  we performed our annual impairment test on october   which resulted in estimated fair values of each of our reportable units under sfas in excess of their net book values 
as a result  we did not have any additional impairment under the provisions of sfas for as stated above  sfas requires companies to test for goodwill impairment annually and also between annual tests if an event occurs or if circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below the unit s carrying amount 
in mid december of  we issued a press release stating that we would have lower than anticipated earnings for the quarter and the year due to softness in sales during the holiday season 
in addition  the press release cited unanticipated competitive factors contributing to our earnings shortfall 
as a result of this information  our stock price declined sharply 
we believe these events are indicators or factors that would require a company to perform an interim goodwill impairment test in accordance with sfas as a result  we performed an interim impairment test on our goodwill balance as of december  this test resulted in estimated fair values of each of our reportable units under sfas in excess of their net book values 
as a result  we did not have any additional impairment under the provisions of sfas for we will perform our annual impairment test for on october   and on an interim date in should factors or indicators become apparent that would require an interim test 
a significant downward revision in the estimated future cash flows could result in a material impairment of goodwill under sfas

a store is included in the same store revenues calculation after it has been opened and operated by us for more than weeks 
an acquired store becomes part of the same store base in the rd week after its acquisition and conversion 
the percentage change is computed by comparing total net revenues for stores at the end of the applicable reporting period with total net revenues from these same stores for the comparable period in the prior year 

table of contents change in accounting estimates for rental library and and special item charges during the third quarter of  we began implementation of a strategic re merchandising plan to allow for an expansion of store space for dvds and other strategic product offerings 
this plan was completed by december  we initiated this plan with the goal of optimizing our stores revenues and gross profit based on an evaluation of our product mix and product offerings 
this evaluation also included analyses of industry trends and projections  such as the accelerated consumer acceptance of the dvd format 
based on our evaluation  and in connection with the resulting plan  we disposed of approximately of our vhs rental library in our stores  certain vhs merchandise inventory primarily located in our distribution center and certain games from our rental library in our stores 
these activities resulted in non cash charges of million to cost of rental revenues and million to cost of merchandise sold recorded in  which reflected the net book value of the disposed library and inventory items  net of proceeds 
we also recorded a charge of million in incremental selling  general and administrative expenses during  primarily related to i labor incurred during to execute the plan  ii supply and disposal costs incurred to execute the plan and iii severance for certain employees terminated as a result of a reorganization of our marketing and new media operations 
during  we reduced our estimate of severance charges by million 
as of december   million remained as an accrual for severance related to this special item charge 
additionally  during  we recorded charges of million and million million  net of tax in depreciation expense related to the plan for the write off of fixed assets and equity in income loss of affiliated companies for the adoption of a similar re merchandising plan by one of our joint venture operations  respectively 
additionally  in connection with the re merchandising plan  and to address the impact of changes in the rental business  effective july   as detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we changed the accounting estimates related to our vhs and game rental libraries  including residual values and useful lives 
as a result of the changes in estimates  cost of sales was million higher for the year ended december  than it would have been under the previous method 
also during  we recorded million in selling  general and administrative expenses related to our wage and hour and extended viewing fee cases discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in connection with the dismissal of our wage and hour case  we reduced the initial accrual by million in our estimates of future costs are subject to change if and as circumstances change and additional information becomes available 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined that the carrying value of certain hardware and capitalized software components of our former new media segment  primarily related to the e commerce portion of blockbuster 
com  exceeded the estimated undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by those assets 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million 
this charge is included in depreciation expense in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  as noted in the discussion above  and operating income was affected by one time  primarily non cash charges 
a comparison of reported and operating income with reported prior years operating income is less meaningful as a result of these items 
management believes adjusting prior years to reflect the impact of excluding these non cash charges provides a more meaningful comparison of operating income and is more useful in analyzing the underlying historical results and future trends

table of contents excluding the special item charges and the change in accounting estimates in and  operating results would have been as follows for the years ended december  revenues cost of sales gross profit operating expenses operating income comparison of to revenues 
revenues of  million in increased million  or  from  million in of the increase  was attributable to merchandise sales and was attributable to rental revenues 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in other revenues 
the increase in revenues was primarily due to an increase in worldwide same store revenues of and the net increase in the number of company operated stores of from december  to december  the increase in worldwide same store revenues reflects a increase in same store revenues from our domestic operations and a increase in same store revenues from our international operations 
the increase in domestic same store revenues was primarily due to a increase in same store merchandise sales 
the increase in same store revenues from our international operations was primarily due to the the growth in dvd revenues and the impact of copy depth programs in key international markets 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in other revenues  primarily attributable to a decrease in revenues associated with our directv initiative  reflecting a decrease in system sales 
rental revenues 
rental revenues are generated from the rental of vhs tapes  dvds and video games and from any eventual sale of previously rented vhs tapes  dvds and video games 
revenues generated from rental transactions include revenues received in connection with the initial rentals of product  as well as revenues received in connection with any continuations of such rentals past the initial rental period  as contemplated by our membership agreement 
under our standard domestic rental policy  at the time the product is rented  a customer pays for the initial rental and  pursuant to the terms of our membership agreement  agrees to pay for any continuation of the rental beyond the initial rental period 
generally  when a customer keeps rental product beyond the initial rental period  the customer s rental is successively continued for the same number of days and at the same price as the initial rental period  until such time as the product is returned or purchased under the terms of the membership agreement 
in june  we increased the initial rental period for movies and games other than certain newly released movies from five days to one week 
in addition  we offered store based subscription rental offers  or rental passes 
the rental passes allowed customers to rent an unlimited number of items during the term of the pass  subject to a limit of the number of items that could be taken at one time 
items could be returned at any time during the term of the pass 
as contemplated by the terms and conditions of the passes  additional fees did not accrue on pass rentals during the pass term  however  if a customer kept an item beyond the pass term  the rental continued  beginning at noon on the day immediately following the last day of the pass term  for the same number of days and at the same price had the item been rented on that day under our standard rental terms and not under the pass 
the rental was successively continued on such terms until such time as the item was returned or was purchased under the terms of our membership agreement 
we continue to evaluate our store based subscription offerings and anticipate offering rental passes again in 
table of contents rental revenues of  million in increased million  or  from  million in of the increase  was attributable to movie rental revenues and was attributable to game rental revenues 
the following is a summary of rental revenues by product category year ended december  percent of total percent of total movie rental revenues vhs rental revenues dvd rental revenues total movie rental revenues game rental revenues total rental revenues the increase in rental revenues was primarily due to the net increase in the number of company operated stores of and an increase in worldwide same store rental revenues of 
the increase in worldwide same store rental revenues reflects an increase in international same store rental revenues of and an increase in domestic same store rental revenues of 
our domestic operations represented of our rental revenues in  compared with of our rental revenues in the increase in worldwide same store rental revenues was primarily due to a increase in same store rental revenues from the eventual sale of previously rented product 
this increase was driven by increases in sales of previously rented dvds and games  which were partially offset by a decrease in sales of previously rented vhs tapes 
overall  the additional transactions from the sale of previously rented dvds more than offset the decrease in transactions from the sale of previously rented vhs tapes 
the increase in previously rented dvd sales reflects the continued growth of dvds as a percentage of our product mix  in response to increased consumer demand 
the increase in previously rented dvd sales as a percentage of our product mix has also led to an increase in our average price on our previously rented movie sales  as previously rented dvd sales have a higher price on average than previously rented vhs sales because of the popularity and durability of the format 
the sale of previously rented product represents the culmination of the rental cycle and allows us to maximize the revenues and gross profit from our investment in rental library product 
the increase in domestic same store rental revenues also reflects a box office advantage between titles that became available during versus titles that became available during movie rental revenues 
movie rental revenues of  million in increased million  or  from  million in dvd rental revenues continued to increase as a percentage of total rental revenues from in to in  while vhs rental revenues continued to decrease as a percentage of total rental revenues from in to in the increase in overall movie rental revenues was primarily due to a increase in previously rented movie sales  which are included in rental revenues 
this increase reflects i consumer interest in the value that we  unlike traditional retailers  can offer by selling previously rented movies  and ii our resulting ability to maximize the revenues and gross profit from our investment in rental library product 
the increase in previously rented product sales also reflects the additional flexibility that we have under our more recent purchase arrangements to sell product earlier  which has resulted in increased sales volume and pricing for previously rented product 
this increase was driven by a increase in revenues generated by sales of previously rented dvds  which was partially offset by an decrease in revenues generated by sales of previously rented vhs tapes 
the selling price for previously rented dvds is higher on average than the selling price for previously rented vhs tapes 
therefore  the increase in previously rented dvd sales as a percentage of total previously rented movie sales also resulted in a higher average selling price on a combined dvd vhs basis 
we expect continued growth in rental revenues generated by the eventual sale of previously rented movies 

table of contents game rental revenues 
game rental revenues of million in increased million  or  from million in the increase in game rental revenues was primarily due to i the increased availability of game software  ii increasing penetration of the sony playstation  nintendo gamecube and microsoft xbox hardware platforms  iii our games in store re merchandising  and iv our increased focus on marketing games  including the sales of the games freedom pass  a store based subscription game rental offer that we offered during the summer of we expect continued growth in game rental revenues

the increase in worldwide same store merchandise sales reflects a increase in domestic same store merchandise sales and a increase in international same store merchandise sales  both primarily due to an increase in retail dvd and game sales 
movie sales 
movie sales  which include sales of vhs tapes  dvds  vcrs and dvd players  of million in increased million  or  from million in the increase in movie sales was primarily related to our increased focus on the sale of new movies to complement our rental offering and to accommodate increased demand for retail movies  primarily dvds  in as a result of this increased focus  we continued to expand the selection of dvds in our stores 
we also took advantage of our ability to offer promotions that combine movie rentals with sales of popular retail titles  thereby providing an alternative to the offerings provided by a retailer that only offers a purchase opportunity 
this new focus led to an overall increase in retail movie transactions in as compared with additionally  the increase in dvd sales as a percentage of total movie sales led to a increase in the average selling price of retail movies  as retail dvd sales have a higher average selling price than retail vhs sales 
we expect our promotional activities  as well as the customer traffic generated by our rental business  to continue to drive increased movie sales 
game sales 
game sales  including sales of game hardware and software  of million in increased million  or  from million in this increase was driven by a increase in retail game transactions and a increase in retail games pricing  primarily due to the impact of the increasing penetration of the game hardware platforms 
during  we increased our focus on the sale of new games hardware and software to complement our rental offering and to accommodate increased demand for retail games 
as a result of this increased focus  we expanded the selection in our stores for games hardware and software 
the increase in game sales was primarily due to the increased availability of game software and increasing penetration of the sony playstation  nintendo gamecube and microsoft xbox hardware platforms 

table of contents cost of sales 
cost of sales of  million in decreased million from  million in excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimates and special item charges of million in  cost of sales of  million in increased million  or  from  million in the increase in our cost of sales was primarily due to a shift in our product mix and the net increase in the number of company operated stores of excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimates and special item charges in  cost of sales as a percentage of total revenues increased to in from in the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of total revenues was primarily due to the following merchandise sales increased as a percentage of total revenues 
merchandise sales inherently have a lower gross margin than rental revenues and correspondingly higher cost of sales as a percentage of revenues 
our merchandise gross margin has declined as we have grown our merchandise sales 
our merchandise gross margin decreased from due to strong growth in new release dvd and game software and hardware sales  which on average have a lower gross margin than other merchandise sales  primarily due to the current competitive environment for these products 
in addition  our merchandise margin decreased due to an increase in shrink in related to the increased demand for dvd product and with our increased presence as a video game retailer 
dvd and video game products are more susceptible to shrink due to their portability and popularity 
we continue to design and implement controls at our stores to lower our shrink results  especially in relation to our dvd and video game products 
as we expand our retail offerings to include an increased selection of catalog dvd retail product  we expect our average dvd retail margins to increase  as catalog dvd retail product generally has higher margins than other merchandise sales 
the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of revenues was partially offset by an increase in our rental gross margin during  as compared with rental gross margin increased primarily due to the following movie rental revenues generated through revenue sharing programs decreased  and we obtained more favorable terms on revenue sharing programs in than in movie rental revenues generated through revenue sharing programs on average have a lower gross margin than movie rental revenues generated through product acquired apart from such programs 
therefore  the decrease in movie rental revenues generated through revenue sharing programs and the more favorable revenue sharing terms resulted in a higher gross margin percentage from overall movie rental revenues 
vhs and dvd rental revenues generated through sell through pricing arrangements continued to increase as a percentage of total rental revenues 
vhs and dvd rental product purchased through sell through pricing arrangements on average has a lower overall cost than other rental product  resulting in higher rental margins 
the increases in our movie rental gross margin were partially offset by a decrease in our game rental margin  primarily related to additional product purchased to support our games freedom pass 
we expect our vhs and dvd rental revenues generated through sell through pricing arrangements to continue to increase as a percentage of total revenues 
as a result  we expect our cost of movie rental revenues to continue to decrease as a percentage of movie rental revenues in gross profit 
gross profit of  million in increased million from  million in excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimates and special item charges of million in  gross profit of  million in increased million  or  from  million in  primarily driven by the growth in revenues as discussed above 
excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimates and special item charges in  gross margin decreased to in from in the decrease in gross margin was due to the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of revenues described above  notably the increase in merchandise sales  which inherently have a lower gross margin than our rental revenues

we expect advertising expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenues in other corporate and store expenses decreased million  due primarily to a reduction in our bad debt expenses as a result of improved focus on bad debt collection 
depreciation expense 
depreciation expense of million in decreased million  or  as compared with million in excluding special item charges of million in  depreciation expense in decreased million  or  from million in the decrease was primarily a result of a lower depreciable asset base in  as compared with over the past year  the amount of capitalized assets becoming fully depreciated exceeded the amount of capital additions  and approximately of the capital expenditures during occurred during the third and fourth quarter 
these decreases were partially offset by the net increase in the number of company operated stores of interest expense 
interest expense of million in decreased million  or  as compared with million in the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to a reduction of million in total debt  including capital lease obligations  from december  as our significant free cash flow was used to reduce debt 
the decrease was also attributable to lower average interest rates 
other items  net 
other items  net increased million to income of million in from a loss of million in the primary reason for the increase was a write off related to three investments in the fourth quarter of totaling million and a foreign currency transaction gain in  as overall  the functional currencies in our international operations have strengthened versus the us dollar  as compared with these increases were partially offset by a write down of an investment during 
table of contents benefit provision for income taxes

excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimates for rental library and special item charges in  the provision for income taxes would have been million in the provision reflects the non deductibility of goodwill amortization associated with viacom s acquisition of us in the provision for income taxes increased primarily due to higher earnings before taxes for both foreign and domestic operations 
the tax matters agreement dated august  between us and viacom requires us to surrender all or a portion of the united kingdom tax loss carryovers generated by us to viacom upon request without compensation 
during the third quarter of  viacom notified us that the conditions pursuant to which viacom would require us to surrender the losses were no longer applicable and  therefore  viacom would not request us to surrender our united kingdom tax loss carryovers 
accordingly  we reduced the valuation allowance related to our net loss contingencies attributed to the united kingdom by million as it is now more likely than not that these tax loss carryovers will be utilized in the future 
in  we determined because of our continued and projected profitability in mexico that our net operating losses generated in the past in mexico would more likely than not be utilized 
accordingly  during the fourth quarter of  we reduced the valuation allowance related to our net operating loss carryforwards attributed to mexico by million 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax 
as of january   we adopted sfas which eliminates the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives and requires instead that those assets be tested for impairment annually 
the application of the transition provisions of this new accounting standard required us to reduce our goodwill balance by billion during the first quarter of  which is reflected in the income statement as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax and does not affect operating income or cash flow

net loss of  million in represents an increase in net loss of  million from the net loss of million in excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimates for our rental library and special item charges of million in  the net loss for increased  million from net income of million

we did not recognize a benefit for losses incurred in certain foreign jurisdictions in our and tax provisions as it is currently more likely than not that the benefit will not be realized 
due to continued and projected profitability in mexico  we now believe that our net operating losses generated in the past in mexico will more likely than not be utilized

liquidity and capital resources liquidity and capital resources we generate cash from operations predominantly from the rental and retail sale of videocassettes  dvds and video games and we have substantial operating cash flow because most of our revenue is received in cash and cash equivalents 
we expect to fund our future anticipated cash requirements  including the anticipated cash requirements for capital expenditures  commitments and payments of principal and interest on any borrowings  with internally generated funds  as well as with funds available under our credit facility 
we believe that these two sources of funds will provide us with adequate liquidity and capital necessary for at least the next twelve 
table of contents months 
however  we may seek to issue debt and or equity securities in the future to the extent we determine that the issuance of securities would serve to maximize our capital structure or would otherwise be advantageous to our company 
in october  about blockbuster music stores were sold to wherehouse entertainment inc some of the leases transferred in connection with this sale had previously been guaranteed either by viacom or its affiliates 
in connection with our initial public offering  we entered into an initial public offering and split off agreement with viacom  pursuant to which we agreed to indemnify viacom with respect to any amount paid under these guarantees 
on january   wherehouse filed a petition for protection under chapter of us bankruptcy law 
based on information regarding lease and guaranty expirations provided to us by wherehouse in connection with its bankruptcy  we estimate that we are contingently liable for approximately million 
of this amount  we recorded a reserve of million during the fourth quarter of in occupancy expense  which represents our estimate of the lease guaranty obligation associated with the stores that wherehouse has indicated it will vacate 
the remaining million of the contingency relates to stores wherehouse has indicated it will continue to occupy and  therefore  we do not currently expect to have to perform under the related guarantees 
any payments we are required to make under the guarantees in excess of our recorded reserve would negatively affect our results of operations 
we expect any payments for these guarantees to be funded from operating cash flow 
as described more fully in notes and to the consolidated financial statements  at december  our scheduled obligations  were as follows contractual obligations year years years after years total long term debt wherehouse lease guaranty obligation capital lease obligations operating leases total contractual obligations includes both principal and interest 
capital structure on june   we entered into a billion unsecured credit agreement with a syndicate of banks 
the credit agreement was initially comprised of a million long term revolver due july   a million term loan due in quarterly installments beginning april  and ending july   and a million short term revolver  which was fully paid down during the repayment of the short term revolver permanently reduced the borrowing capacity under the credit agreement from billion to billion 
effective may   we permanently reduced the banks commitment under the long term revolver from million to million 
we had million of available borrowing capacity under the long term revolver at december  in addition  during  we paid down million under the term loan  leaving an outstanding balance of million at december  the reduction of the banks commitment under the long term revolver and the payments made under the term loan effectively reduced the borrowing capacity under the credit agreement to billion 
we have the ability with this available borrowing capacity under the long term revolver to extend the maturities of the current portion of our term loan 
we intend to utilize this available borrowing capacity to extend the maturities of million of the current portion of our term loan from to accordingly  we have classified these amounts as long term in our consolidated balance sheet at december  we continue to review our financing arrangements and to pursue strategies to optimize our capital structure 
interest rates under the credit agreement are based on the prime rate in the united states or libor plus a margin  or libor spread  based on leverage ratios  which is currently  at our option at the time of 
table of contents borrowing 
the weighted average interest rate at december  for borrowings under the credit agreement  including the effects of our interest rate swaps  was 
a variable commitment fee based on the total leverage ratio is charged on the unused amount of the revolver at december  the credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants  which  among other things  relate to the payment of dividends  repurchase of our common stock or other distributions and also require compliance with certain financial covenants with respect to a maximum leverage ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
at december   we were in compliance with all covenants under the credit agreement 
in march  we entered into two interest rate swaps with viacom in order to obtain a fixed interest rate with respect to million of our outstanding floating rate debt under the credit agreement  and thereby reduce our exposure to interest rate volatility 
the swaps fixed million of our outstanding debt at an interest rate of for two years and the other million at an interest rate of for two and one half years 
our effective interest rates also include the libor spread payable under our credit facility 
including the effect of the libor spread  the effective interest rates of the swaps are currently and  respectively 
the swaps are subject to termination in the event that i viacom ceases to own greater than of our outstanding common stock  or ii we no longer have any obligations under the term loan portion of the credit agreement 
the interest rate swaps qualify as fully effective cash flow hedging instruments under sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
therefore  the gain or loss of the qualifying cash flow hedge is reported in other comprehensive income loss and reclassified into earnings in the same period in which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
at december   the fair value of the interest rate swaps was a liability of million 
we entered into two additional lines of credit with banks for an aggregate of million in the fourth quarter of the availability under these lines was reduced to million in we also have additional lines of credit that were previously held by our joint venture in italy  which we purchased in the fourth quarter of these lines of credit carry interest rates ranging from to over euribor and an aggregate borrowing capacity of approximately million euros or approximately million as of december  
there were no outstanding amounts under these lines of credit at december  and million outstanding under these lines of credit in consolidated cash flows operating activities 
net cash flows from operating activities increased million  or  from  million for to  million for the most significant reason for the increase in cash flows from operating activities was an improvement in income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  and excluding the impacts of the change in accounting estimates and special item charges  of million 
in addition  the change in operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to a million increase in accounts payable and a million increase in our merchandise inventory 
the primary reasons for the increase in product purchases and merchandise inventory were increases in our retail movie inventory  which more than doubled  and in our retail games inventory  which was a new product line for our domestic operations in these increases are mainly related to our increased focus in on the sale of new movies and games to complement our rental offerings and to accommodate the increased demand for movies and games retail product 
we expect our merchandise inventory levels to continue to be higher than they were in  however  in  we expect the balance to be lower than the balance as of december  investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities increased million from million for to  million in this increase was due to a million increase in rental library purchases  a million increase in cash used for acquisitions and a million increase in capital expenditures 
the increase in rental library purchases was mainly due to increased purchases of video game and dvd rental library product to accommodate the increased consumer demand for video games and dvds and to support new store growth 
the increase in cash used for acquisitions was due to the acquisitions of several businesses in the united 
table of contents states that operate entertainment related stores and primarily offer pre recorded videocassettes  dvds  as well as video games  for rental and sale  the second largest games retailer in the united kingdom and the interest that we did not already own in our joint venture based in italy in the increase in capital expenditures was primarily due to new store openings and expenditures related to initiatives associated with our ultimate movies and retail re merchandising efforts in our capital expenditures include store equipment and fixtures  remodeling of some existing stores  implementation and upgrading of office and store technology and the opening of new store locations 
each new store opening requires initial capital expenditures  including leasehold improvements  equipment and construction costs 
we plan to evaluate and pursue new sites within the video rental industry in both the united states and in certain international markets and will require capital and or ongoing infrastructure enhancements to support acquisitions and our expansion strategies in developing markets 
we added net new stores in and currently expect to add approximately to net new stores in we had capital expenditures of million in and currently anticipate that capital expenditures of approximately to million will be incurred in the projected increase in capital spending from is due primarily to planned increases in expenditures related to new stores  store remodeling and the implementation and upgrading of store technology 
financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities decreased million from million for to million for this decrease in cash used in financing activities was primarily due to a net pay down of long term debt under our credit facility of million for  as compared with a net pay down of million in long term debt under our credit facility in other financial measurements working capital at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
working capital  however  reflected a deficit of million due to the accounting treatment of our rental library 
our rental library is accounted for as a non current asset and is excluded from the computation of working capital 
liabilities associated with the acquisition costs of rental product  however  are reported as current liabilities and  accordingly  are included in the computation of working capital 
consequently  we believe working capital is not as significant a measure of financial condition for companies in the home video industry as it is for companies in some other industries 
because of this accounting treatment  we may  from time to time  operate with a working capital deficit 
availability of foreign net operating losses as more fully discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we were required  if so requested by viacom  to surrender certain tax losses of our united kingdom subsidiaries for and earlier years to viacom without any compensation 
however  during the third quarter of  viacom notified us that the conditions pursuant to which viacom would require us to surrender the losses were no longer applicable and  therefore  viacom would not request us to surrender our united kingdom tax loss carryovers 
accordingly  we reduced the valuation allowance by million as it is now more likely than not that these tax loss carryovers will be utilized in the future 
at december   deferred tax assets associated with our foreign net operating losses approximate million  of which million is reserved 
related party transactions effective with our initial public offering in  we entered into a transition services agreement with viacom whereby viacom is providing us with certain cash management  accounting  management information systems  legal  financial  tax and other services 
these services may change upon agreement between viacom and us 
the fee for these services approximates viacom s cost and could be subject to adjustment 
we have agreed to pay or reimburse viacom for any out of pocket payments  costs and expenses associated with these 
table of contents services 
the services agreement expires upon the closing of a split off or similar transaction 
the charges for services were million for each of the years ended december   and viacom paid insurance premiums for a limited number of our property and life insurance policies for us 
our reimbursements to viacom for insurance expense related to these policies were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  and is reflected as a component of our total insurance expense within general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
through the normal course of business  we are involved in transactions with companies owned by or affiliated with viacom 
we purchase certain videocassettes and dvds for rental and sale directly from paramount pictures corporation and showtime networks  inc  subsidiaries of viacom 
total purchases from paramount were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively

total amounts paid for purchases from midway were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in addition  some of our studios allow us to direct a significant amount of their home video advertising expenditures 
we received million  million and million from paramount in  and  respectively  related to this arrangement 
these amounts have been recorded as reductions to our advertising expenses during the periods presented as they reflect reimbursements of costs actually incurred 
we use a third party agency to allocate our media placement and spending  based on specifications determined by us in accordance with independent market studies 
the third party agency conducts a competitive negotiation process with media outlets including viacom affiliates  which are generally offered an opportunity of first refusal 
during the years ended december   and about million  million and million  respectively  of our aggregate advertising expenditures were spent with viacom affiliates 
advertising expenditures spent with viacom affiliates as a percentage of our total advertising expenses were  and for  and  respectively 
the increase in advertising expenditures spent with viacom affiliates as a percentage of our total advertising expenses in is primarily due to the merger of cbs corporation and viacom in may of and viacom s acquisition of bet holdings ii  inc in february of in  we entered into a us promotional and customer database services and licenses agreement with mtv networks  a business unit of viacom 
pursuant to this agreement  for one year  we agreed to provide certain promotional and database services to mtvn and grant a us license to mtvn to use our us customer database internally and or sublicense the database for internal use to affiliates of mtvn that are direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of viacom and to mtvi group  lp and its direct and indirect affiliates for internal use 
in return  mtvn paid us million 
mtvn had an option to extend in perpetuity the license to use the customer database 
we have recognized revenue from this transaction over the estimated useful life of the agreement  which was expected to exceed one year 
accordingly  we recognized million in and million in the first two quarters of during the third quarter of  mtvn elected not to exercise this option and  as a result  we have no further obligation to mtvn 
accordingly  the remaining deferred revenue of million was recognized in the third quarter of and is reflected in other revenues in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  in conjunction with the sale by viacom music to wherehouse we assumed certain liabilities as a result of the disposition of music with a corresponding reduction to viacom s net equity investment 
the nature of these liabilities was predominantly for lease obligations associated with closed music stores excluded from the sale 
table of contents and  to a lesser extent  certain transaction costs and various costs to complete the transition of operations from music to wherehouse 
these total liabilities at the date of assignment aggregated approximately million  of which million remained in current liabilities at december in march  the company entered into two interest rate swaps with viacom in order to obtain a fixed interest rate with respect to million of the company s outstanding floating rate debt under the blockbuster credit agreement 
see the capital structure section above for further discussion on the interest rate swaps 
we entered into a tax matters agreement with viacom which provides that subsequent to the closing of our initial public offering on august   we will continue to be included in the viacom federal consolidated income tax return and certain consolidated  combined and unitary state tax returns  as long as viacom s ownership is at least of the total voting power of the stock and of the total value of the stock 
as of december   viacom owned common stock representing approximately of our equity value and approximately of the combined voting power of our outstanding common stock 
the agreement requires us to make payments to viacom equal to the amount of the income taxes which would be paid by us  subject to certain adjustments  if we had filed a stand alone return for any taxable year or portion thereof beginning after august  in which we are included in the viacom group 
the current income tax liabilities for the periods presented prior to our initial public offering were paid by viacom 
any tax losses we generated have been utilized by viacom to reduce its consolidated taxable income 
accordingly  these amounts were reflected in viacom s net equity investment in the consolidated balance sheets 
the agreement also specifies that viacom will indemnify us against any and all tax adjustments to viacom s consolidated federal and consolidated  combined and unitary state tax returns from september  through august  subsequent to august   we became solely responsible for all tax adjustments to our federal and state returns 
additionally  all periods subsequent to august are open for audit 
currently  the internal revenue service is in the process of completing audits for the tax years ending december  through may  with respect to tax attributes such as net operating losses  tax credits and capital losses  we will have the right of reimbursement or offset  which is determined based on the extent such tax attributes could be utilized by us if not in the viacom group 
included in the receivable from viacom balance in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets are income tax receivables of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the right to reimbursement or offset will arise regardless of whether we are a member of the viacom group at the time the attributes could have been used by us 
all other transactions with companies owned or affiliated with viacom did not have a material impact on the financial position or results of operations presented herein 
general economic trends  quarterly results of operations and seasonality we anticipate that our business will be affected by general economic and other consumer trends 
our business is subject to fluctuations in future operating results due to a variety of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
these fluctuations may be caused by  among other things  a distinct seasonal pattern to the home video and video games business  particularly weaker business in april and may  due in part to improved weather and daylight saving time  and in september and october  due in part to the start of school and the introduction of new television programs 
market risk we are exposed to various market risks including interest rates on our debt and foreign exchange rates 
in the normal course of business  we employ established policies and procedures to manage these risks 
interest rate risk total outstanding borrowings under our credit agreement at december  were million 
interest rates for the credit agreement are based on the prime rate in the united states or libor plus a margin  
table of contents or libor spread  based on leverage ratios  which is currently at our option at the time of borrowing 
the weighted average interest rate at december  for these borrowings was 
in march  we entered into two interest rate swaps with viacom in order to obtain a fixed interest rate with respect to million of our outstanding floating rate debt under our credit agreement  and thereby reduce our exposure to interest rate volatility 
the swaps fixed million of our outstanding debt at an interest rate of for two years and the other million at an interest rate of for two and one half years 
our effective interest rates also include the libor spread payable under our credit facility 
including the effect of the libor spread  the effective interest rates of the swaps are currently and  respectively 
the swaps are subject to termination in the event that i viacom ceases to own greater than of our outstanding common stock or ii we no longer have any obligations under the term loan portion of our credit agreement 
we are primarily vulnerable to changes in libor  however  we do not believe this exposure to be material 
a one percentage point increase or decrease in libor would not materially affect our annual interest expense 
foreign exchange risk operating in international markets involves exposure to movements in currency exchange rates 
currency exchange rate movements typically also reflect economic growth  inflation  interest rates  government actions and other factors 
as currency exchange rates fluctuate  translation of the statements of operations of our international businesses into us dollars may affect year over year comparability and could cause us to adjust our financing and operating strategies 
revenue and operating income would have increased by an additional million and decreased by million  respectively  if foreign exchange rates in were consistent with on january   eleven member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing  or local  currencies and one common currency  the euro 
the transition period for the introduction of the euro took place between january  and june  the euro trades on currency exchanges and may be used in business transactions 
conversion to the euro eliminates currency exchange risk between the participating member countries 
our euro transition has been completed and our transition to the euro currency has not had a significant impact on the manner in which we conduct our business affairs and process our business and accounting records 
accordingly  conversion to the euro has not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
our operations outside the united states constituted  and of our total revenues in  and  respectively
