we make our aola country services available to a broad audience of potential subscribers by offering multiple mechanisms through which our members can pay us 
with the exception of brazil  the aola country services and the aol branded service in puerto rico were initially launched with credit cards as the primary subscriber payment method 
the brazil country service concurrently offered credit cards and a cash payment method known as the boleto 
the boleto is a customary form of payment in brazil under which brazilian banks that we designate act as conduits for collecting the related payments 
in addition  customers of certain banks in brazil  including customers of our banco ita co branded service  have the option of permitting direct debits from their accounts for purposes of paying subscriber fees 
in may  we began to offer cash payment options in mexico and argentina 
under cash payment alternatives  members can subscribe to our aola country services without using a credit card  thus allowing us to reach a greater number of potential members 
members in puerto rico may pay their subscription fees either through credit cards or direct debit to their bank accounts 
since its introduction  the cash payment alternative has accounted for a substantial majority of all new member registrations in brazil  mexico and argentina and as of december  represented the payment mechanism selected by approximately of our subscribers in brazil other than those to the banco ita co branded service  of our members in mexico and of our members in argentina 
as of march   approximately of our total subscriber base excluding subscribers to the banco ita co branded service had selected payment options other than credit card or direct debit 
although we have not experienced any significant difficulties collecting subscription fees from members using credit cards and direct debit mechanisms  collection rates from members opting for the cash payment mechanisms have been lower and less timely 
we are taking steps to improve further the validation of registration data provided by cash payment subscribers by requiring these subscribers to call our customer service centers to finalize their registration 
in mexico  we are also emphasizing prepaid subscription plans whereby subscribers pay in advance for service periods ranging up to one year 
initial results indicate these efforts have resulted in a reduction of the overall percentage of members who have selected the cash method as their payment option 
in mexico  prepaid plans are growing in importance and currently account for about of current aol mexico members  however  prepaid plans are not currently actively marketed in brazil  argentina and puerto rico 
we are taking steps to encourage conversion of subscribers selecting cash payment options to credit and direct debit payment options 
for instance  we offer discounts to subscribers to our aola country services other than subscribers to the banco ita co branded service who choose the credit card payment option 
free trial 
we generally make our aola country services and the aol branded service in puerto rico  including internet access  available for free to new subscribers for a limited period of time so they can experience our service 
we currently offer most new subscribers to our aola country services  including subscribers to the banco ita co branded service  a day free trial period from the date they 
table of contents register for the service 
over the past year  we reduced the length of the free trial period and no longer offer three month trial periods 
this reduction was undertaken in connection with our efforts to improve the quality of our membership base by targeting members who are more likely to pay their subscription fees on a timely basis 
beginning in january  in mexico  we eliminated free trial periods entirely for members who choose cash payment options 
us hispanics content area under a one year agreement dated as of february  with america online  we program a content area on the aol service in the united states targeted to the fast growing hispanic community in the us the content area is located in the aol us service at aol keyword latino and includes spanish language content from providers including univision 
com and efe 
america online is obligated to pay us  per year for these programming services to reimburse us for our costs 
we also have the potential to participate in the advertising revenue generated from this content area once certain minimums are achieved 
the amount of such advertising revenue is not expected to be material 
aol mobile in brazil  mexico and argentina  we offer aol mobile service that allows consumers with internet ready mobile phones to access select content and features of the aola country services 
in addition  subscribers to the aola country services can access aol e mail using aol mobile 
we offer aol mobile services to customers of the following mobile phone providers telefonica celular and nextel 
compuserve we have the right to market the compuserve brand in latin america 
from our inception until early  we received subscription fees from users of the compuserve service 
we ceased operation of our compuserve service in strategic alliance with banco ita in june  we entered into a ten year strategic alliance with banco ita  one of the largest banks in latin america 
we launched a co branded  customized version of our america online brazil service that banco ita began marketing to its customers in december  and banco ita is obligated to promote the co branded service as the principal means of accessing banco ita s interactive financial services 
we believe that our relationship with banco ita will enable us to expand our internet presence in brazil by allowing us to gain access to banco ita s online as well as offline customer base 
on december   we entered into an agreement that restructured our strategic marketing alliance with banco ita 
under the new agreement  we now oversee  in large part  the marketing activities for the co branded service 
banco ita is obligated to establish kiosks and point of sale displays in hundreds of its bank branches for the promotion of the co branded service  which are staffed by promoters trained by aol brazil 
the number of promoters will vary depending on the success of the marketing efforts  which are reviewed quarterly 
if the marketing efforts do not meet specified goals  the number of promoters will be decreased  subject to a floor on the number of promoters 
conversely  if the marketing efforts exceed specified levels  the number of promoters will be increased  subject to a maximum number of promoters 
potential subscribers are able to sample the co branded service and register in the bank branches 
banco ita also is required to distribute  at our direction  a certain number of cd roms containing the software for the co branded service  via in branch promotions and direct mail 
in addition  banco ita must produce and broadcast a certain number of television commercials promoting the co branded service and is required to provide exclusive or preferred online banking benefits to subscribers to the co branded service 
banco ita will be responsible for the cost of these marketing efforts 
the modified marketing arrangements will remain in effect through march  although the original ten year term of the agreement did not change 

table of contents banco ita s customers who register for the co branded service after december  are entitled to a one month free trial period  the length of which may be changed in the future  and  if they subscribe to the monthly unlimited use plan  they are entitled to a discount off the standard price 
prior to the new agreement  banco ita was required to offer its subscribers at least one hour of subsidized usage per month following the expiration of their trial period  although banco ita was responsible to us only for actual usage by the subscriber 
banco ita is no longer required to subsidize usage for new subscribers to the co branded service who register after december   however  banco ita  at its option  may subsidize hours for certain customers who were subscribers to the co branded service prior to december  in addition  during a short transition period  banco ita is required to pay us a nominal amount for subscribers who have not used the service during the previous month and who are no longer in their free trial period 
as of february  approximately three fourths of the subscribers to the banco ita co branded service had not used the service during the previous month 
furthermore  substantially all of the remaining banco ita subscribers who were not in their free trial periods as of that date did not exceed the time subsidized by banco ita 
we expect these inactive subscribers to be terminated  as discussed below 
we are contacting subscribers to the co branded service who do not subscribe to a paid plan to encourage them to subscribe to the discounted unlimited plan or to other subscription plans 
those who fail to elect a plan will have their co branded service discontinued 
we expect that a majority of current subscribers to the banco ita co branded service who do not use the service or are not subscribers to a paid plan  approximately  to  subscribers  will be terminated during the first half of for failing to select a plan  with the majority of the terminations occurring during the first quarter of although these terminations will decrease our membership levels  termination of these members is not expected to materially impact our revenues or costs since they were not paying us or using the service 
under the terms of our original agreement with banco ita  banco ita and we established subscriber targets for the co branded service of  verified subscribers at december  and  at december  subsequently moved to april  and a secondary target of a total of  verified subscribers at december  subsequently moved to april  
in addition  banco ita and we had established the following additional targets i for the month period ending december   revenues generated from subscribers to the co branded service would account for at least of our aggregate revenues in brazil  ii on december   there would be at least  verified subscribers  and for the twelve months ended on that date revenues generated from subscribers to the co branded service would account for at least of our aggregate revenues in brazil  and iii for the month period ending december   revenues generated from subscribers to the co branded service would account for at least of our aggregate revenues in brazil 
verified subscribers are those subscribers who have used the co branded service in any two of the three months preceding the applicable measurement date or who have first accessed the co branded service in the month prior to the applicable measurement date 
under the agreement  if the verified subscriber level and revenue targets were not met  banco ita was required to make a reference payment to us 
banco ita met the subscriber target for the co branded service of  verified subscribers at the december  measurement date 
under the terms of the new agreement  banco ita and we have eliminated the subscriber targets for the period ending april  which was the second measurement period under the agreement and have replaced the targets for the remaining three years with targets based on a combination of minimum revenue levels in the same percentages as described above for each of the next three years and the fulfillment of the marketing commitments described above 
if these new targets are not met  banco ita is required to make reference payments to us 
the dates for measuring performance with these new targets were moved to march   and the aggregate amounts that banco ita will be required to pay us if the marketing or revenue targets are not met  which are subject to annual ceilings  have been reduced from an aggregate of approximately million to approximately million for the balance of the initial five year marketing period 
in addition  the aggregate amount that banco ita would be 
table of contents obligated to pay us in the event of a termination of the agreement prior to march  has been reduced from approximately million to approximately million 
termination 
in general  if we or banco ita commit a material breach of our agreement and fail to cure the breach  then the non breaching party will have the right to terminate the agreement after an arbiter reviews the matter and confirms the uncured material breach 
if the breach relates to an exclusivity provision  the non breaching party may elect to continue the agreement with the option to be relieved of the exclusivity provisions of the agreement applicable to it 
banco ita may also terminate the agreement upon a change in control of aola 
a material breach of the agreement by us includes if subscribers are unable to access the co branded service for specified periods of time  and our breach of certain exclusivity obligations under the agreement 
customer service one of the key tenets to our strategy is to focus on customer service by offering comprehensive online and offline customer support 
offline customer service 
we have established a local call center in brazil and a regional call center in argentina 
we consolidated customer call center support for our spanish language members in argentina during for the aol branded service in puerto rico and in early for the aola country service in mexico to maximize operational efficiencies and benefit from lower cost opportunities afforded by the recent steep devaluation of the argentine peso 
english language support for members of the aol branded service in puerto rico is provided by america online 
we presently staff each call center with knowledgeable customer service representatives who are available hours a day  seven days a week to assist our members in their local language with inquiries relating to products  technical support  billing  online security and online community monitoring 
our customer service is free of charge for subscribers enrolled in our bundled services plans and currently is provided through toll free telephone numbers 
customers enrolled in our lower cost unbundled service plans incur per call or time based charges for accessing live call center support 
our customer service representatives also proactively communicate with new members to encourage them to use our aola country service and their many features 
we believe this improves the member s online experience and leads to improved retention and increased loyalty 
online help 
our aola country services provide extensive help features to assist new users coming online for the first time 
members are able to reach customer service representatives by e mail and aol instant messenger 
the services also have the notify aol feature that allows members to contact us for security assistance and the download sentry alert feature that reminds members not to download files attached to e mails sent from strangers 
content our aola interactive services feature content obtained from leading local  regional and global content providers and member generated content  including movie and book reviews  message board commentary and online discussions 
our agreements with third party content providers range from simple links between our interactive services and the provider s web site to an integration of their content into our interactive services 
we attempt to select our content providers based on the quality and depth of their content 
in brazil  we have entered into agreements with over content providers such as jornal do brasil  banana games  gazeta mercantil  gazeta esportiva  editora delta  ag ncia estado and paralela 
in mexico  we have entered into agreements with content providers  including ponchito 
com  planeta local  notimex and universo estudiantil 
in argentina  we have entered into agreements with over content providers including asatej  cybermapa  familia digital  de mujer and revista insider 
we have 
table of contents entered into agreements relating to the aol branded service in puerto rico with content providers including san juan star  la estrella de puerto rico  nocaut and revista vea 
advertising and other revenues we generate a portion of our revenues from advertising on our online services 
such advertising revenues are derived from third party relationships we develop ourselves and participation in deals arranged by america online 
through our relationship with america online  we sometimes have the opportunity to participate in america online s global advertising arrangements 
in argentina  we also generate additional revenues from other sources such as revenue sharing agreements with telecommunications providers 
advertising 
the country specific and regional focus of our interactive services enables advertisers to execute advertising and marketing campaigns that take advantage of the common cultures and interests of the region while retaining the ability to tailor their campaigns to specific demographic groups 
we offer our advertisers a variety of customized programs for the marketing of products and services  including advertising arrangements under which we receive fees based on the number of advertisements displayed on our interactive services  and sponsorship or co sponsorship arrangements that allow advertisers to sponsor an area on our interactive services in exchange for a fixed payment 
in return for most advertising arrangements  we receive cash payments  the opportunity for revenue sharing  or both 
we have also entered into and will continue to seek barter arrangements  including co marketing and cross promotion agreements 
to date  the number and effect of barter arrangements that we have entered into has not been material 
in the past  sometimes we chose to accept an equity interest as payment  or partial payment  for arrangements entered into with development stage companies 
current advertisers or sponsors of channels on our america online brazil service include banco ita and banco santander 
current advertisers or sponsors of channels on our america online mexico service include american express and hewlett packard 
current advertisers or sponsors of channels on our america online argentina service include bagovit and deautos 
com 
current advertisers on the aol branded service in puerto rico include centennial and plaza las americas 
other revenues 
because local telephone service in latin america is often metered  the utilization of our aola country services by our members results in incremental revenues to local telecommunications companies 
to encourage incremental traffic on their local networks by our members  local providers of network access may enter into agreements compensating us for routing our traffic on their networks 
currently  we have such agreements with telecommunications providers in argentina 
under these agreements  we receive payments based on the number of modems we have connected to the telecommunications provider s network 
such revenues have not been material to date 
marketing our marketing goals are to attract new consumers to subscribe to  and to retain existing subscribers of  our aola country services by building brand awareness and encouraging consumers to try our interactive services 
we make it convenient for consumers to experience our online services 
in the past  each time we launched our online service in a new market or released a new version of the online service software  we typically distributed compact discs cds containing the software for our localized online service 
these cds offered consumers the opportunity to use our online service free of charge for a limited trial period and were distributed through a broad range of distribution vehicles 
currently  in an effort to target higher value members  we have largely ceased the mass distribution of cds 
instead  we promote distribution of our software cds primarily through point of sale displays and kiosks located in high traffic retail locations such as shopping malls and large retailers 
we also seek to attract members through agreements with computer and computer peripheral manufacturers oems 
for example  we have entered into agreements for the bundling of our america online service software with hewlett packard in mexico and metron  brazil s largest personal computer manufacturer 
consumers are also able to request 
table of contents cds through local toll free telephone numbers and are able to download our online services software via the internet 
in the first quarter of  we began to implement measures designed to better target higher value members and to increase the efficiency of our member acquisition efforts by focusing on targeted groups that have a greater likelihood of becoming members who pay on a timely basis and remain subscribers to our services for an extended period of time 
we hope to achieve this by focusing acquisition efforts on marketing channels that historically have resulted in higher subscription rates and lower acquisition costs 
the success of these measures will depend in part on our ability to identify members that are most likely to pay their subscription fees on a timely basis and our ability to develop software tools and support systems designed to verify billing data for new subscribers to our country services and block access to subscribers who do not pay their subscription fees on a timely basis 
as part of these efforts to target higher value members  our revised marketing agreement with banco ita requires the establishment of kiosks and point of sale displays in hundreds of banco ita branches in brazil 
we have also entered into a marketing agreement with mcdonald s in brazil to establish interactive kiosks in mcdonald s restaurants 
we will continue to use traditional advertising campaigns  including television  radio and print publication  to maintain and increase consumer awareness of the aola brand and attract new members and users 
however  as our brands have become more established  we have reduced our reliance on traditional advertising campaigns 
we currently have marketing arrangements in place in puerto rico with pueblo supermarkets and blockbuster  which are associated with the cisneros group 
the cisneros group has agreed to attempt  on a commercially reasonable best efforts basis  to provide us with access to the services provided by companies associated with the cisneros group at rates at least as favorable as those charged to anyone else  except for their affiliates 
however  we have no assurance that their efforts will be successful and it is possible that we may not receive access at favorable rates or at all 
we have also utilized and expect to continue employing other innovative marketing strategies 
for example  we were the exclusive sponsor of rock in rio  a rock festival held in rio de janeiro  brazil in january  which gave us the opportunity to promote our services to over one million concertgoers 
we also have launched programs such as sign on a friend in brazil  mexico and argentina that involve paying our members a fee for each additional member they refer to our service 
local and long distance telephone service  telecommunications network capacity and technology local and long distance telephone service 
in each of our latin american target markets  our members initiate access to our aola country services through local and long distance telephone lines 
these lines are owned and operated by local and regional telephone service companies 
in most latin american countries  local phone service continues to be metered  which results in incremental variable cost to subscribers of our country services 
metered phone service  however  has presented us with the opportunity to earn additional revenues or reduce our expenses through revenue sharing agreements with local phone companies  in brazil and argentina 
the telephone service industry in latin america continues to undergo considerable change 
many latin american telephone companies in recent years have undertaken significant investments in their infrastructure 
these investments have resulted in an improvement in the quality of telephone service in these countries 
although the telephone service industry in latin america is significantly less developed than in the us  we believe that the local and long distance telephone service available is of adequate quality and sufficient capacity to meet the needs of our current and prospective members 
additionally  local and long distance telephone charges have declined over time  a trend which is expected to continue as a result of increased competition spurred by deregulation 
nevertheless  because local calls in most latin american countries are metered  the total cost of internet access in latin america is substantially higher than in the us proposals are currently pending in brazil that would implement pricing methods  including flat rate pricing options for data calls  in addition to existing 
table of contents metered local telephone service 
if adopted  we believe this would increase internet usage by lowering the overall cost of accessing the internet 
however  governmental approval is still needed before such proposals could go into effect 
telecommunications network capacity 
third party telecommunications network providers transmit our online services data between the local and long distance telephone services used by our members in latin america and america online s servers  which run all of our interactive services  in the us these third party networks provide the modems that allow our members to establish a connection to our online services 
they also carry our data between latin america and the us through fiber optic cable 
in brazil  we have contracts with embratel  an affiliate of worldcom  and telefonica  and an arrangement with brazil telecom  to carry our data within brazil and to provide the modems through which our members connect to our america online brazil service 
we previously had an agreement with at t brasil  which expired in december however  at t brasil still provides us with modems during a transition period while these modems are migrated to the networks of other vendors 
embratel and telefonica also carry our data from brazil to the us through their own or affiliates networks or through third party suppliers 
our contracts with telefonica and embratel expire on december  and may   respectively 
we also have access to capacity provided by progress telecommunications corporation progress through a contract between america online and progress 
america online invoices us for the capacity used by us under this agreement 
in mexico  we have entered into a network contract with avantel  an affiliate of worldcom 
our contract with avantel expires in january we also have an arrangement with telefonos de mexico telmex under which we obtain additional network capacity 
in argentina  we entered into a network contract with impsat  which expired in december  however  modems are being provided to us under a transition period while we are in negotiations with impsat regarding a possible new agreement 
in each of our target markets we work closely with our network providers to ensure satisfactory network performance 
we work with network providers that have multiple operations centers for network monitoring  and we have developed quality control standards that our providers must meet 
fiber optic cable is our preferred means of transmitting data between latin america and the us because it offers greater capacity and is generally more reliable than satellite based transmissions 
all of our data transmitted between the us and mexico  brazil and argentina is transmitted by fiber optic cable 
in each country where we operate our aola country services  we believe that we have secured adequate network capacity 
to ensure this going forward  we regularly forecast our needs and make adjustments based on marketing projections 
we believe our current suppliers can and will provide us with sufficient network capacity 
however  this capacity is based on our expectations of use and growth in specific geographic areas 
our contracts usually commit us to purchase a minimum amount of network capacity 
if the number of our subscribers  or their use of our online services  does not increase  our per unit network costs will not correspondingly decrease 
technology 
our servers are owned and maintained by america online in three locations in virginia in the united states 
the aola content and the tools to operate our online services are located on these servers

competition we operate in the highly competitive and rapidly evolving businesses of online services and internet access  online advertising and commerce 
we compete with providers of spanish and portuguese language interactive services  including internet access services  portals  search engines and web directories 
we 
table of contents compete in the broader latin american regional market as well as in country specific local markets 
our principal regional market competitors include terra lycos  an affiliate of telefonica  and microsoft msn 
our primary local competitors in our core target countries include universo online uol and free services provided by internet gratis ig  super and ibest in brazil  telmex in mexico  which has an alliance with microsoft for the development of content and offers a prodigy branded service  ciudad internet and arnet  which is owned by telecom  in argentina  and puerto rico telephone company  at t  earthlink and juno in puerto rico 
providers of free internet access in brazil have continued to attract significant numbers of new users 
we also compete for advertising revenues with traditional media such as newspapers  magazines  radio and television 
our online service subscription fees are generally higher than those offered by competing online service providers because we consider our service to be a premium service 
we continually assess our pricing strategy and may make modifications as necessary 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in generating advertising revenue include not only the number of visitors to an online service or internet site  but also demographics of visitors

these third party licenses may be royalty free or may require payments by us 
from december  through december   we did not make any payments to america online for services received under the license agreement 
we believe that annual payments for these services will not exceed  in the future

america online may terminate our rights under the license if we materially breach its terms 
trademarks and domain names america online has granted us rights to use in latin america its registered trademarks containing the aol brand and domain names  including www

we believe that america online is taking appropriate steps to protect its trademarks and domain name rights in latin america 
we rely on a combination of contract provisions and patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws to protect our rights in our online services as licensed to us by america online 
we have distributed and will continue to distribute software  licensed to us by america online  for our online services under agreements that grant members a license to use the software 
we rely on the protections afforded primarily by copyright laws to protect against the unauthorized reproduction of the software 
we also rely in part on electronic licenses which members do not manually sign  and instead agree to by clicking a button on their monitor screen 
these licenses may be unenforceable under the laws of brazil  mexico and argentina and other jurisdictions in latin america 
we attempt to protect our trade secrets and other confidential information through agreements with employees and consultants 
although we intend to protect our rights vigorously  these measures may not be successful 
policing unauthorized use of the software for our online services is difficult and the steps taken may not prevent the misappropriation of our licensed technology and intellectual property rights 
moreover  effective patent  trademark  trade secret and copyright protection may be unavailable or limited in latin america 
america online has obtained us federal registrations for a number of trademarks and service marks  including aol  america online  buddy list  and aol s triangle design logo  and has trademark rights in the us and abroad in many other proprietary names  including aol instant messenger  you ve got mail and compuserve 
we believe that our exercise of our licensed rights under our agreement with america online does not infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties 
however  america online has received communications from third parties asserting that features  contents or names of some of our services may infringe their patents  copyrights  trademarks and other rights 
we are not involved in any litigation of this type that would have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop  market and sell or operate our

third parties may also challenge america online s marks and these challenges may result in limitation or loss of our licensed rights to america online s proprietary marks 
government regulation and legal uncertainties in brazil  there are no license or registration requirements applicable to interactive services 
however  the brazilian legislature is considering various laws that would regulate interactive service providers  including laws that would create potential liabilities for interactive service providers whose members offer illegal goods  services or information through their service  laws allowing telecommunication providers to provide interactive services and laws regarding taxation of interactive service providers 
we cannot predict at this time whether or not these bills will be enacted or  if enacted  whether they will undergo major changes or what any potential effect on our business could be 
we believe regulations relating to local telephone pricing are likely to be modified in brazil  including a possible change that would permit alternative rate pricing for internet access calls  including flat rate pricing 
we believe that this change  if enacted  could encourage internet usage 
in connection with this proposed regulation  rules governing interconnection fees between telecommunications providers may be modified 
we cannot predict at this time whether or not these regulations will be enacted or  if enacted  what form of alternative rate pricing might be adopted  or what any potential effect on our business could be 
these changes would also likely impact the competition for interactive services in brazil  although we cannot predict what the impact may be 
in mexico  the federal telecommunications law requires providers of value added services  including internet access services  to register with the mexican federal telecommunications commission 
we have complied with this registration requirement 
in argentina  internet access providers must hold a correspondent license from the argentine telecommunications authority 
we have received this license 
the argentine national government does not specifically regulate information available on the internet 
however  argentine laws and regulations on consumer protection  contract  competition and advertising generally apply to portal and commerce service providers 
in this respect  several judicial precedents have recognized the applicability of commercial  criminal and civil law to internet matters 
we intend to support proposals designed to enhance market access and competition in the offering of both dial up and high speed interactive services in our target markets and believe that the adoption of these proposals would have a beneficial effect on the development of interactive services 
we are unable  at this time  to predict whether any of these proposals will be adopted

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview of fiscal in the first quarter of  we began to implement measures designed to better target higher value members and to increase the efficiency of our member acquisition efforts by focusing on targeted groups that have a greater likelihood of becoming members who pay on a timely basis and remain subscribers to our services for an extended period of time 
as a result  we focused our acquisition efforts on marketing channels that historically have resulted in higher subscription rates and lower acquisition costs 
the success of these measures will depend in part on our ability to identify members that are most likely to pay their subscription fees on a timely basis and our ability to continue to develop software tools and support systems designed to verify billing data for new subscribers to our country services 
as a result of these efforts to target higher value members  we experienced reductions in our sales and marketing costs primarily as a result of moving away from the mass distribution of non solicited cds containing our software and towards an approach focused mainly on acquiring members through direct customer interaction channels such as the establishment of staffed kiosks in high traffic locations and through original equipment manufacturers oems 
additionally  we also experienced improvements in our operating cost structure as the scope of our network and call center support operations was made 
table of contents proportional to the resulting reduced membership base 
telecommunications and network expense were reduced by resizing our network to meet lower peak demand  which was achieved by restricting access for members who do not make timely membership fee payments and through the termination of members who were delinquent in their payments 
our rate of member acquisitions was also affected as our more targeted marketing efforts resulted in lower rates of new member additions 
over the longer term  we hope that our strategy of focusing on higher value members will result in lower overall membership turnover 
a crucial element of our effort to target higher value members is our increased focus on improved validation of registration data from subscribers  especially for subscribers who have chosen the cash payment option 
the objective is to better identify members who are more likely to pay us  as well as to continue to terminate members that are delinquent in paying us 
our greater selectivity in the acquisition of new members has resulted in fewer new registrations  but which we hope will eventually be of higher quality 
as a result  our membership base at december   experienced a slight reduction of to million members  as compared with million ending members at september   driven by membership turnover and termination of members who were delinquent in their payments to us 
during the quarter ended december   our paying membership base improved slightly as compared to the quarter ended september  most benefits from these initiatives represented one time adjustments to our cost structure and were largely implemented during calendar although we expect some additional benefits going forward  we believe these benefits will be significantly less in absolute terms and indeed  these costs will begin to increase in absolute terms if our overall membership base begins to increase again 
to date  our focus on more efficiently targeting higher quality members has been successful in significantly reducing costs  however  it had only marginally increased the number of paid members 
we expect that our membership base  excluding subscribers to the banco ita co branded service  will decrease by approximately  members in the first quarter of  as we continue to terminate members that are delinquent in the payment of subscription fees to us and reduce marketing expenditures by more narrowly targeting marketing activities aimed at attracting new  higher value members 
as part of the revised banco ita agreement  members to the co branded service will be required to select a specific price plan 
those who do not select a plan will be terminated from the co branded service 
we expect that a large majority of members to the co branded service with low levels of activity will not choose a price plan and will therefore be terminated 
we expect membership to our banco ita co branded service to decrease by  to  members during the first half of as a result of the termination of members who do not choose a paid plan of the co branded service  with the majority of the terminations occurring during the first quarter of termination of these members is not expected to materially impact our revenues or costs since they were not paying us or using the service 
as of december   approximately  members  or of our total ending membership base  was comprised of members of the banco ita co branded service 
of these  a significant majority had not accessed the service in the past month 
we also expect that over the near term a substantial percentage of our total subscribers will continue to be in free trial periods  member retention programs or not making timely payment 
timing of the growth in our membership base will be significantly influenced by the extent of the success of the revised marketing agreement with banco ita 
we are also currently in discussions with other retailers and financial institutions concerning additional marketing agreements in our effort to attract higher quality members 
for example  in january  we entered into an agreement with mcdonald s in brazil to market our service via kiosks in hundreds of mcdonald s restaurants in brazil 
timing of implementation of such agreements will also impact our non ita membership base

our total revenues for the year ended december  were million  up from million for during fiscal  subscription revenues grew to million and represented of total revenues  up from million and of total revenues in fiscal the growth in subscription revenues was partially offset by a decline of million  or  in advertising and other revenue to million during the fiscal year ended december  excluding the effect of the stronger us dollar relative to foreign currencies  in constant currency terms total revenues increased during as compared to during the year ended december   revenues from brazil increased to million  up from million in the year ended december   while revenues from mexico rose to million

our total reported revenues for the three months ended december  were approximately million  a decrease of  or million  as compared with revenues of million in the fourth quarter of the decrease was driven primarily by a decline of million  or  in advertising and other revenues  while subscription revenues for the period were essentially flat versus the three months ended december  for the fiscal fourth quarter  revenues from subscriptions to the aola country services and the aol branded service in puerto rico were million and accounted for of total revenues 
in constant currency terms  for the quarter ended december   total revenues rose before the negative translation impact of the stronger us dollar  driven by an increase of in subscription revenues versus the quarter ended december   which was partially offset by a drop in advertising and other revenue of 
information on a constant currency basis excludes the effect of foreign currency translation on reported results 
constant currency results are calculated by translating the current year results at prior year monthly average exchange rates

subscription revenues 
for the periods presented  our subscription revenues were generated from members paying fees to subscribe to the aola country services and revenues received from america online related to subscribers of the aol branded service in puerto rico 
we began operations in brazil in november  in mexico in july and in argentina in august and we began receiving revenues related to subscribers to the aol branded service in puerto rico in december subscription revenues do not include amounts paid to us by banco ita on behalf of its customers for subsidies which it chooses or is required to make 
such receipts are netted against and recorded as a reduction of marketing expenses and thus are not accounted for as subscriber revenues 
amounts paid directly to us by subscribers that exceed the time subsidized by banco ita are included in subscription revenues 
beginning in the second quarter of  we expect fees received from banco ita for subsidies of its members to largely end since banco ita is no longer responsible for making such payments under the revised marketing agreement 
as of march  we offered brazilian subscribers three methods by which they could pay their subscription fees credit cards  debit cards and cash payments through a mechanism known as boletos bancarios boleto 
in addition  banco ita customers have the option of permitting direct debits from their accounts for purposes of paying subscriber fees 
the boleto is a customary form of payment under which brazilian banks that we designate act as conduits for collecting the related payments 
similar forms of payment are also commonly used in mexico and argentina 
we send each member a boleto and the member pays the boleto at a local bank 
these local banks then send the payments to our designated banks 
the boleto is more costly for us than payment through credit and debit cards and results in a longer collection cycle 
approximately of our subscribers in brazil other than those to the banco ita co branded service had selected this method of payment as of december  although we have not experienced any significant difficulties collecting subscription fees from members using credit and debit cards  collection rates from members opting for the boleto payment mechanism have been lower and less timely 
as of march  subscribers in mexico and argentina could choose among two methods by which they could pay their subscription fees credit cards and cash payments 
as in brazil  cash payment mechanisms in these countries depend on banks and other third party collection locations that forward funds to banks designated for that purpose by the company 
as of december   approximately of our members in mexico and of our members in argentina had selected the cash payment option  and the collections experience in these countries has been similar to that in brazil 
in mexico  we are also emphasizing prepaid subscription plans whereby subscribers pay in advance for service periods ranging up to one year 
initial results indicate these efforts have resulted in a reduction of the overall percentage of members who have selected the cash method as their payment option 
in mexico  prepaid plans are growing in importance and currently account for about of current aol mexico members  however  prepaid plans are not currently actively marketed in brazil  argentina and puerto rico 
in brazil  mexico and argentina  we are taking steps to improve the validation of registration data provided by cash payment subscribers through the development of real time validation mechanisms or by requiring these subscribers to call our customer service centers to finalize their registration 
the vast majority of puerto rican members have selected credit cards or direct debit to their bank accounts as their payment options 

table of contents for subscribers that have elected to pay their subscription fees with credit cards  we begin to recognize subscription revenues when the fees become due 
for subscribers who pay through means other than credit cards  we begin to recognize subscription revenues when we receive payment 
as of march  approximately of our total subscriber base excluding subscribers to the banco ita co branded service has selected non credit card and non direct debit payment options 
we are taking steps to encourage conversion of non credit card and non direct debit payment method subscribers to credit and debit payment options 
for instance  we have implemented programs offering discounts to subscribers to our aola country services to encourage them to choose the credit card payment option 
for the fiscal year ended december   subscription revenues reached million and of total revenue  an increase of as compared to the year ended december   for which subscription revenues were million and represented of total revenues 
reported year over year results were driven by increases in the number of paid members to our aola country services and the aol branded service in puerto rico 
excluding the effects of currency devaluation  subscription revenues increased as compared to the year ended december  going forward  we expect that subscriber revenue growth will depend primarily on the success of our revised marketing agreement with banco ita as a channel for acquiring high quality members who remain with us for an extended period of time and make timely payments to us 
we also expect other marketing agreements that we may enter into  including the agreement with mcdonald s in brazil  will be an important factor in the evolution of future subscription revenue performance 
subscription revenue will continue to be negatively impacted  especially with regard to year over year comparisons  by the devaluation of the brazilian real and  more recently  by the devaluation of the mexican peso 
the average exchange rate for the brazilian real was r per us dollar during  as compared with an exchange rate of r per dollar at december  the mexican peso has devalued by an additional from december  through march  growth in subscription revenues may also be negatively impacted by the slowdown in sales of personal computers taking place throughout most of latin america as a result of recent economic volatility  which may hamper our ability to attract new subscribers to our aola country services 
for the year ended december   subscription revenues related to our aola country services were million  an increase of as compared to million for the twelve month period ended december  during the fiscal year  subscription revenue accounted for of total revenues  up from of total revenues in the twelve months ended december  this increase in subscription revenues was due to the increased billings for the aola country services in brazil  mexico and argentina  and revenue related to the aol branded service in puerto rico 
for the twelve months ended december   subscription revenues were million  with million  or of our total subscription revenues  being generated from subscribers to our aola country services in brazil which was launched in november  mexico which was launched in july and argentina which was launched in august 
we generated the remainder of our revenues from subscribers to our compuserve classic service 
there were approximately  compuserve subscribers when we acquired the subscription base from america online on december  at december  there were approximately  compuserve classic subscribers 
the decline in our compuserve classic subscription base occurred because we did not market the service to retain or increase members 
we terminated the compuserve classic service in march advertising and other revenues 
advertising and other revenues are derived principally from advertising arrangements under which we receive fees based on the number of advertisements displayed on our interactive services  advertising sponsorship or co sponsorship arrangements that allow advertisers to sponsor an area on our interactive services in exchange for a fixed payment either in cash or  in one instance  equity  and 
table of contents revenue sharing agreements with telecommunications companies 
because local telephone service in latin america is often metered  the utilization of our aola country services by our members results in incremental revenues to local telecommunications companies 
to encourage incremental traffic on their local networks by our members  local providers of network access may enter into agreements compensating us for routing our traffic on their networks 
for the year ended december   revenue from advertising and other declined by approximately million  or  to million  and accounted for of total revenues  down from million and of total revenues in the year ended december  the decrease in advertising and other revenues was driven primarily by the continued weak advertising market in latin america  with all our countries except puerto rico recording declines 
during the year ended december   brazil accounted for of total revenue from advertising and other activities and mexico accounted for  while puerto rico and argentina accounted for most of the remainder of the balance 
during the fourth quarter of  revenues from advertising and other were approximately million  down million from the fourth quarter of although this represented an increase on a sequential basis versus the third quarter of  we expect advertising and other revenue to decrease for the full year during fiscal  as compared to results in fiscal  as advertisers allocate their limited resources to traditional media  rather than online advertising 
we expect our first quarter advertising and other revenue to register a significant decline versus the first quarter of we expect future advertising and other revenue to only recover along with overall market conditions 
we expect to continue deriving the substantial majority of our revenues from subscriptions to our aola country services  rather than advertising and other revenues 
for the year ended december   advertising and other revenues increased to million  up from million in the twelve months ended december   and represented of total revenues 
advertising and other revenues for the year ended december  increased  or million from the twelve months ended december   driven primarily by full year contributions from mexico and argentina 
during the year ended  brazil accounted for of revenue from advertising and other revenues  with mexico accounting for  argentina for and puerto rico  corporate and other accounting for the remainder of the balance 
during the twelve month period ended december   brazil accounted for of revenue from advertising and other 
contributions from our country services in mexico and argentina were small as a result of their newly launched status 
despite the year over year increase in versus the twelve month period ended  advertising and other revenues began to experience a decline in the fourth quarter of calendar year  as performance was impacted by the world wide slowdown in advertising expenditures brought about by slowed global economic growth and the economic crisis in argentina 
the cutback in advertising expenditures by major advertisers accelerated in the wake of the september terrorist attacks in the united states 
during the year ended december   advertising and other revenues from related parties accounted for approximately million  or  of the million recorded for the period  up from million and in the prior year

the reduction in sales and marketing expense was driven by the change in our strategy to focus our efforts towards the acquisition of higher quality members and lower spending on brand advertising 
our strategy to focus on higher quality members resulted in significantly less emphasis on our 
table of contents traditional vehicle for the acquisition of new members the mass distribution of cds containing our software in favor of oem channels and staffed kiosks in high traffic retail locations and malls

for the year ended december   total costs and expenses were million  which represented an increase of approximately million  or versus the twelve month period ended december  the increase was driven by higher membership levels and the resulting increase in network and member services costs  which are a function of membership and new registrations 
general and administrative expense increased million  or  over the comparable period in  reflecting the full year of country operations in mexico  argentina and puerto rico 
sales and marketing expense  however  declined by million during fiscal  to million  following the initial launch related expenditure peak in cost of revenues

for the year ended december   cost of revenues decreased by approximately  or million  to million  from million in our fiscal year 
the decrease was driven by reductions in network and telecommunications costs and call center costs  reflecting primarily the impact of initiatives to focus on higher quality members and restrict access to our network and call center support services to members who are delinquent in their payments of fees to us 
cost of revenues during fiscal include one time costs to size our network to service higher quality members in the amount of million

currency devaluation reduced reported cost of revenues by million during the quarter ended december  going forward  we expect cost of revenues to decrease in absolute terms from levels experienced in fiscal  driven by the impact of currency devaluation on reported costs  the consolidation of member services for spanish language countries in argentina and negotiated reductions in network costs with local telecommunications companies 
we expect that the rate of improvement in year over year comparisons will begin to decrease after the first half of fiscal  once the impact of currency devaluations and of recent cost reduction initiatives are incorporated into the base periods 

table of contents for the twelve months ended december   cost of revenues increased to approximately million  up million  or  from million in the twelve month period ended december  this increase resulted primarily from higher network expenses and costs related to our call centers  driven by the increase in our membership base and the first full year of service of our aola country services 
cost of revenue accounted for of our total cost structure during fiscal  up from from the comparable period 
this relative increase as a proportion of total costs and expenses occurred as a result of both the increase in absolute spending in cost of revenues and the reduction in sales and marketing expense

the expenses paid to america online are largely variable in nature and are a function of our membership levels and the time spent on our aola country services and the aol branded service in puerto rico by our members 
as of december   america online billed us approximately million over and above amounts we have recorded in our statements of operations 
the difference relates to a portion of items under dispute  primarily for support services provided by america online 
we are currently negotiating with america online regarding the total amount in dispute and at this point do not expect to pay this approximately million amount 
as a result  this amount is not reflected in our consolidated statement of operations 
in the event we are unable to negotiate a favorable resolution of this dispute  we may recognize an incremental charge to our future cost of revenues

for the twelve months ended december   sales and marketing expenses totaled approximately million  a decrease of approximately  or million  versus the reduction in sales and marketing expenditures during fiscal was achieved by the implementation of initiatives designed to target members who have higher probabilities of becoming and remaining paying members 
specifically  this has resulted in a significant reduction in the mass mailing of non solicited cds containing our software in favor of an increased focus on acquiring members through direct customer interaction channels and original equipment manufacturers oems 
currency devaluation also accounted for part of the variation in sales and marketing expense during fiscal  reducing reported expense by approximately million 
for the fourth quarter of  sales and marketing expenses were million and represented of our total costs and expenses  down  or million  from million and of total costs and expenses in the quarter ended december  during the three months ended december   currency devaluations reduced reported sales and marketing expenses by million versus the comparable prior year period 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses in the quarter ended december  was primarily driven by lower spending in direct marketing million and brand marketing million  partially offset by miscellaneous increases in related general and administrative sales and marketing expense 
these declines resulted primarily from the recent initiatives also driving the year over year variances 
we expect to reduce our brand marketing efforts from current levels over the near term to reduce costs 
we evaluate 
table of contents the productivity and marginal contribution of our kiosks and expect to reduce the number of points of sales or relocate them to other more productive locations to reduce our direct marketing costs during most of the improvements in sales and marketing expense represented one time reductions to our cost structure 
although we expect that improvements will continue to be observed in declining degrees over the first half of  we expect sales and marketing expense to remain near current levels in absolute terms over the near future

excluding the impact of the banco ita amortization expense  expenditures related to sales and marketing decreased by million in  or versus the comparable prior year period  as a result of the absence of launch related expenditures in  lower per unit cd and distribution costs and the absence of one time costs associated with the sponsorship of the rock in rio music festival in during the year ended december   sales and marketing expenses continued as our single largest cost category 
although down from in the comparable prior year period  sales and marketing expenses represented of total costs and expenses during fiscal in addition to the banco ita amortization expense  amounts paid or accrued to related parties for sales and marketing activities for the twelve month periods ended december  and december  were million and million  respectively  primarily related to estimated bounties for new customers to the aol branded puerto rico service acquired through channels controlled by america online and for advertising on media properties controlled by aoltw 
the year ended december  includes a credit of  related to a revised estimate of bounties for new subscribers to subscribers to the aol branded service in puerto rico obtained through channels controlled by america online 
in connection with our strategic marketing agreement with banco ita of brazil  we issued an aggregate of  shares of class a common stock  valued at million based on the initial public offering price of per share to banco ita on august  since there are potential  specific payments from banco ita to us related to performance in the first five years of the agreement with banco ita  million of the cost value of the shares issued is being expensed on a straight line basis over that period 
the remaining balance of the cost  million  is being expensed on a straight line basis over the ten year term of the agreement 
the revision of the marketing agreement did not change the accounting treatment of the amortization 
general and administrative 
for the year ended december   general and administrative expenses were approximately million  a decrease of million  or  from million in the prior fiscal year ended december  this reduction in general and administrative expense reflects the benefits from our september workforce reduction  the impact of currency devaluation in brazil and argentina and reduced bad debt expense related to uncollectible accounts receivable

since we expect to pay the interest on the aoltw notes through the issuance of additional stock  this interest is not expected to have a cash impact on our finances 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net consists primarily of interest income  foreign currency gains and losses and realized gains and losses on investments 
for the year ended december   interest and other income  net was  down from million in the year ended december  this decrease of million was due to significantly lower interest income  as we reduced our cash balances to fund the business  and instead began to incur interest expense related to our issuance of senior convertible notes to aoltw in connection with our march financing 
we also incurred an impairment loss of our investment in hollywood 
com of approximately million during fiscal for the year ended december   interest and other income  net was million  and was comprised primarily of interest income derived from the investment of proceeds raised during previous financing rounds

for this period  capital expenditures were million 
this was financed primarily through reductions in our cash balances  and a slight decrease in our working capital 
in order to fund our future operating and cash requirements  on march   we entered into a note purchase agreement with aoltw 
under the note purchase agreement  aoltw made available to us  subject to standard borrowing conditions  million in exchange for senior convertible notes of aola due in march we drew down the remaining balance available to us under the note purchase

the senior convertible notes are convertible at any time at the option of the holder  and will be redeemable by aola at any time after september   subject to the holder s right to convert the senior convertible notes into preferred stock 
in addition  the senior convertible notes are required to be repaid prior to maturity  at the option of the holder  in the event of significant asset sales or if we raise additional debt or equity funds 
interest is payable either in cash or preferred stock  at our option 
if interest is paid in shares  the price per share is determined based on the average closing price of the class a common stock for the twenty trading dates prior to the date of payment 
for the year ended december   we incurred approximately million related to interest payable to aoltw on the senior convertible notes 
this was comprised of approximately million cash payment and the issuance of  shares of preferred stock 
going forward  we expect to incur approximately million in annual interest expense as long as the full amount of million in senior convertible notes are outstanding 
we expect to pay future interest amounts through the issuance of additional shares of preferred stock  which will result in additional dilution to existing stockholders 
in the event the million in senior convertible notes were to be converted by aoltw  an additional  shares of preferred stock would be issued to aoltw  increasing the economic ownership by america online and its affiliates in aola to and their relative voting strength to  also assuming conversion of the warrant granted to america online at the date of our ipo and the options granted to its employees who are members of our board of directors 
interest payments on the senior convertible notes over the remaining life of the notes will total approximately million  assuming the notes are not converted to stock prior to their maturity 
because we intend to pay interest through the issuance of additional shares of preferred stock  we expect america online s relative ownership and voting strength to continue to increase over the foreseeable future 
we anticipate that the cash on hand at december  will be sufficient to fund operations into the first quarter of  based upon our current operating budget 
we are currently analyzing various modifications to our operations to address our cash needs beyond there is no commitment or obligation from america online  aoltw or the cisneros group to fund any of our future requirements 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in modifying our operations to conserve cash nor have we identified additional financing sources at this time 
an additional restriction on our ability to obtain additional funding is that the holders of the senior convertible notes can require that the proceeds of any such financing be used to repay the senior convertible notes

the increase in current assets at december  was attributable to the use of initial cash balances throughout the year to finance operating losses and other operating requirements  augmented by the funds made available to us under the note purchase agreement with aoltw

revenue recognition for subscribers in brazil  mexico and argentina that have elected to pay their subscription fees with credit or debit cards  or through direct debit from bank accounts  we begin to recognize subscription revenues when the fees become due and are confirmed as collectible 
for subscribers in these countries who pay their subscription fees through cash payment mechanisms such as boletos  we do not begin to recognize subscription revenues until the cash payment is received 
the vast majority of subscribers to the aol branded service in puerto rico pay their subscription fees by credit card 
subscribers to the aol branded service in puerto rico pay their membership fees directly to america online 
revenue from subscribers to puerto rico  which is paid to us by america online  is recognized when the fees become due 
were we to begin to recognize fees from subscribers choosing cash payment options as revenue when they become due  our subscriber revenues and bad debt expense would be greater than currently reported 
as we continue to acquire additional experience with the collectibility of our cash accounts receivable  we may begin to recognize revenue when the fees become due  although we do not expect to do so in the near term 
under our strategic alliance with banco ita  prior to december   banco ita was required to offer at least one hour of subsidized usage per month to subscribers of the co branded service following the expiration of a subscriber s trial period 
banco ita could also choose to provide additional subsidized time to its customers beyond the one hour obligation 
banco ita was also required to pay us a nominal amount for subscribers who have not used the service during the previous month and who were beyond their free trial period 
amounts paid to us by banco ita on behalf of its customers for subsidies  which it chose or was required to make  are recorded as a reduction of marketing expenses and not as subscriber revenues 
amounts paid directly to us by subscribers that exceed the time subsidized by banco ita are included in subscription revenues 
were we to recognize payments from banco ita as revenues  our subscriber revenues and sales and marketing expense would be higher than currently reported 
under the terms of the revised marketing agreement  banco ita is no longer required  but may choose  to subsidize some of its customers 
to the extent any additional customer subsidies are received from banco ita  we will continue to record such subsidies as reductions in marketing expenses 
valuation of accounts receivable reserve for bad debt we estimate that the carrying amount of our trade accounts receivable  which are primarily from subscriber fees and advertising and other revenues  approximate their fair market value 
this requires us to estimate the portion of accounts receivable that will ultimately be written off as uncollectible 
for this purpose  management maintains an allowance to provide for estimated credit losses and has the responsibility for determining that the allowance is adequate for probable and inherent losses relating to trade receivables at each reporting date 
although allowances for potential credit losses are determined based on historical experience  current evaluation of the composition of accounts receivable and expected credit trends  our short operating history makes prediction of actual credit losses difficult 
to the extent actual credit losses differ from our estimates of uncollectible accounts  the amounts we eventually collect will be adjusted to income in the period actually collected 
we recorded net reductions to the allowance of approximately million during the year ended december  write offs against the allowance totaled approximately  during the year ended december  during the year ended december   we recorded provisions to the allowance of approximately million and write offs against the allowance of approximately  as of december   we had a value added tax vat receivable from the argentine government of approximately million 
this receivable  which arose in the normal conduct of our 
table of contents business  will be recovered as we make sales in argentina and make collections from our customers 
given current economic conditions in argentina  the period of collection could exceed two years 
were the government in argentina to dishonor its vat obligation  or force its exchange for securities of lower value  this could result in an impairment of the value of our vat asset 
to date  we have not established any valuation allowances for this asset 
property and equipment reserve for lease abandonment property and equipment  including leasehold improvements  are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation or amortization is provided using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of each type of asset 
amortization of leasehold improvements is computed using the straight line method over the terms of the leases or estimated useful lives of the improvements  whichever are shorter 
long lived assets and identifiable intangibles related to those assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in connection with the abandonment of leased facilities at our fort lauderdale offices  for the year ended december   we increased the amount of space abandoned in fort lauderdale  and incurred a charge of  through the establishment of an additional reserve related to the future lease commitments for the incremental facilities that are not expected to be used in the future 
we incurred a charge of approximately  during the year ended for the impairment of leasehold improvements and furniture  and established a reserve related to the future lease commitments for the facilities that are not expected to be utilized going forward of approximately  these reserves will have the effect of reducing reported rent expense and amortization expense of leasehold improvements and furniture going forward 
deferred tax assets deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we measure these taxes using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
given our history of operating losses  we have significant tax loss carry forward assets which we have fully reserved to reduce their carrying value to zero 
were we to determine that such assets were eventually to be utilized  we would reverse the related valuation allowances and recognize a benefit related to these assets 
stock based compensation accounting for stock options aola follows sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  which established a fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation plans and encourages entities to adopt that method of accounting for their employee stock compensation plans 
this pronouncement also allows an entity to continue to measure compensation cost for those plans based on accounting principles board apb opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees and disclose the pro forma net income and net income per share as if the fair value method had been applied in measuring cost 
compensation cost is determined based on the intrinsic value of the stock options as required by the provisions of apb accordingly  as a result of applying the intrinsic value method of accounting to stock options we have issued  no compensation expense has been recognized for options granted with an exercise price equal to market value at the date of grant 
expense recognized in relation to the granting of stock options issued below market price totaled approximately  in each fiscal year ended december  and for an options grant issued to our chief executive officer 
had we accounted for stock options issued to our employees using the fair value method  our stock based compensation expense would have been million in the year ended december   and million and million for the years ending december  and  respectively 

table of contents non audit services to be performed by our independent auditors we anticipate that our independent auditors  ernst young llp  will perform the following types of non audit services during the course of tax advisory services audit related services we will seek to obtain approval by the audit committee of our board of directors for these non audit services 
forward looking statements this report and other oral and written statements made by us to the public contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of the forward looking statements are based on management s current expectations or beliefs and are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements 
such statements address the following subjects plans for future expansion of our network  efforts to improve the quality of our membership base and the results of those efforts  future membership levels and growth rates  terminations of subscribers of the banco ita co branded service and the impact of these terminations to us  future advertising and other revenues  the benefits we expect to receive from our strategic alliance with banco ita and marketing agreements with other partners  future marketing efforts  future costs of revenues and future costs and expenses  future losses  the method of payment of interest on the aoltw notes  our expectation that current cash on hand will be sufficient to fund operations into the first quarter of  expected improvements and expansion of telecommunication services and infrastructure in latin america  pricing of telephone services and related regulations in latin america  our ability to effectively compete  america online s ability to protect our intellectual property rights  the adequacy of our network infrastructure and the disputed amounts with america online 
risk factors the following factors  among others  could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements america online  aoltw and the cisneros group control our company  may have interests that conflict with the interests of class a common stockholders and are free to place their interests ahead of those stockholders because america online aoltw and the cisneros group operate in the interactive services and media industries  their current control of approximately  and  respectively  of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock creates actual and potential conflicts of interest between them and us 
neither our restated certificate of incorporation nor our agreements with america online  aoltw and the cisneros group prevent them from pursuing other opportunities that might be disadvantageous to us  acquiring a minority interest in businesses that compete with us or  in some instances  directly competing with us 
consequently  they each have the power to take actions that may be directly opposed to our interests and the interests of the class a common stockholders 
if we are not able to convert our subscribers into paying subscribers  or are unable to retain paying subscribers  we will not be able to increase our revenues as planned we have had difficulty in converting trial subscribers and subscribers who choose non credit card payment options into subscribers who pay on a timely basis 
in addition  our turnover rate among paying subscribers continues at very high levels 
if we fail to successfully convert trial and non credit card payment subscribers  or if we fail to retain paying subscribers  we will have difficulty increasing our revenues and reducing our operating losses 
historically  a substantial majority of our subscribers who have 
table of contents chosen non credit card payment methods have not made payments on their accounts following the end of their free trial periods or have not made timely payment 
because our marketing efforts generally include offering a free trial period to our subscribers  significant portions of our subscribers are in their free trial period 
if our relationship with banco ita is not successful  our reputation  financial condition and competitive position may be harmed our revised strategic marketing alliance with banco ita is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties 
we issued  shares of our class a common stock to banco ita on august  if we are unable to receive the expected benefits from this alliance  our business could suffer 
for example if we and banco ita are not successful in attracting a significant number of subscribers  or if these subscribers do not choose to pay for the service  we will not achieve the revenue levels that we expect 
if we and banco ita disagree on the direction of the alliance  it is unlikely we will fully recover the value of the shares issued to banco ita 
because our agreement with banco ita severely limits our ability to enter into strategic relationships with other financial institutions in brazil  we may be unable to take advantage of potentially lucrative business opportunities 
because we and banco ita are marketing a co branded service  if banco ita experiences any financial difficulties or negative publicity for any reason  our reputation and financial condition could be adversely affected 
we have experienced substantial losses and we may not achieve or maintain profitability we are at an early stage of development in a new and rapidly evolving market 
we incurred cumulative net operating losses of approximately million from december   the date of our inception  through december  we expect to continue to incur net losses as we expend substantial resources to develop our business 
we cannot predict what impact  if any  continued losses will have on our ability to finance our operations in the future 
we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability and we may not be able to do so 
because america online  aoltw  the cisneros group and banco ita do not have any commitment to fund our capital requirements  if we are unable to obtain additional financing from them or other sources  we may be unable to sustain our business we anticipate that cash on hand will be sufficient to fund operations into the first quarter of based upon our current operating budget 
there is no assurance that additional funding will be obtained on favorable terms  if at all  or that the holders of the senior convertible notes issued to aoltw will not require the proceeds of any such financing to be used to repay the senior convertible notes 
to the extent that the holders of the senior convertible notes require the proceeds of any such financing to be used to repay the senior convertible notes  the funds would not be available for use by the company 
any additional equity financing  if available  may be dilutive to our stockholders  and any debt financing  if available  may involve restrictions on our financing and operating activities 
if america online and the cisneros group fail to agree on matters related to our business  our business may be adversely affected for as long as they remain in deadlock because america online and the cisneros group jointly control aola through provisions contained in our restated certificate of incorporation  restated by laws  and stockholders agreement  either america online or the cisneros group can block a wide variety of actions  including marketing activities  budgetary 
table of contents authorizations and changing significant corporate governance provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and restated by laws 
our inability to carry out these actions may adversely affect our business 
our potential issuance of stock upon the conversion of our convertible debt and or our payment of interest under the notes in additional stock will cause substantial dilution and may depress the price of our class a common stock the conversion of the senior convertible notes and or the payment of interest on the senior convertible notes in stock will result in substantial dilution to the interests of our class a stockholders and could decrease the price of our stock 
a decline in the price of our class a common stock could encourage short sales of our class a common stock  which could place further downward pressure on the price of our stock 
we expect to pay interest on the notes issued to aoltw through the issuance of additional shares 
our revenues have been impacted by devaluation of local currencies 
because most of our revenues are paid in latin american currencies  our reported revenues decline as these currencies devalue relative to the us dollar although our reporting currency is the us dollar  most of our revenues are received in the currencies of the countries in which we offer our interactive services 
the currencies of many latin american countries  including brazil  mexico and argentina  have experienced substantial volatility and devaluation in the past 
our revenues will decline in value if the local currencies in which we are paid devalue relative to the us dollar  which would adversely affect our business 
intense competition in latin america may adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and acquire market share we compete in a marketplace with a wide range of competitors  including providers of online and internet access services and portals 
competition is intense and may increase  which could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and acquire market share 
furthermore  providers of free internet access in brazil have continued to attract significant numbers of new users 
we compete with providers of spanish and portuguese language interactive services  including internet access services  portals  search engines and web directories 
we compete in the broader latin american regional market as well as in country specific local markets 
our principal regional market competitors include terra lycos  an affiliate of telefonica  and microsoft msn 
our primary local competitors in our core target countries include uol and free services provided by internet gratis ig  super and ibest in brazil  telmex in mexico  which has an alliance with microsoft for the development of content and offers a prodigy branded service  ciudad internet and arnet  which is owned by telecom  in argentina  and puerto rico telephone company  at t  earthlink and juno in puerto rico 
there are currently many other internet access providers in latin america 
some of our competitors and potential future competitors may have the following advantages longer operating histories  greater name recognition in some markets  better access to capital and larger established customer bases 
our competitors may develop interactive services that achieve greater market acceptance and new competitors may emerge and acquire significant market share 
further  competitors that own or have established alliances with cable  satellite or telecommunications companies may have distribution  technical or financial advantages  including the ability to offer internet access services at lower prices or for free 
volatile economic  social and political conditions in latin america could make it difficult for us to develop our business  generate revenues or achieve or sustain profitability economic  social and political conditions in latin america are volatile 
this volatility could make it difficult for us to develop our business  generate revenues or achieve or sustain profitability 
historically  
table of contents volatility has been caused by currency devaluations  significant governmental influence over many aspects of local economies  imposition of trade barriers and political  social and economic instability 
because america online and the cisneros group control our ability to offer new types of interactive services  our revenues  growth and ability to compete may be adversely affected because of restrictions and limitations in our charter documents  we may not be able to respond quickly  or at all  to new services offered by competitors or take advantage of new business opportunities  which could adversely affect our growth or reduce our revenues 
first  we cannot engage in any business activity other than providing pc based and aol branded tv and wireless based interactive services in latin america without the approval of america online and the cisneros group for as long as america online and the cisneros group own a certain threshold number shares of our stock 
second  even if america online acquires or develops aol branded wireless based online services  we will not be able to offer these services or aol branded tv services in latin america  although we have the license to do so  without the approval of both of the directors appointed by america online and the cisneros group who serve on the special committee of our board of directors 
disputes may also arise with america online over whether our licensed rights extend to particular services  due to possible ambiguities in the terms pc based  tv based and wireless based services 
also  we are prevented from offering our services to spanish and portuguese speaking consumers in countries outside of latin america 
limitations and conditions on our rights to offer aol branded online services and portals in latin america could harm the value of these rights and our ability to effectively compete we have entered into a license agreement with america online under which we have exclusive rights to offer aol branded pc based online services and  as they are developed by america online  aol branded tv and wireless based online services in latin america 
these rights to use america online s brand name and services are vital to our success as an interactive services provider 
however  they are subject to important conditions and limitations  some of which are beyond our control  which could preclude us from exercising our rights or materially diminish their value to us and could adversely affect our business 
first  we have no rights to offer aol branded wireless based online services unless the services are developed by america online for commercial launch before august  second  we will lose our exclusivity i to aol branded pc based online services  upon the later of december  or the date on which either america online or the cisneros group owns or less of our outstanding capital stock as of august   and ii to aol branded tv and wireless based online services  upon the later of august  or the date on which either america online or the cisneros group owns or less of the outstanding capital stock of aola 
third  america online may terminate our license agreement if we materially breach its terms 
fourth  our license to offer a network of spanish and portuguese language aol branded portals in latin america is non exclusive 
except for the compuserve classic branded services  we have no rights to market non aol branded interactive services owned by america online  including netscape  mapquest and moviefone 
these limitations may prevent us from pursuing potentially lucrative business opportunities 
if the telecommunications networks we use are not reliable or are not able to accommodate our anticipated needs  the quality of our online services and our ability to make our online services available to our members would be harmed we depend entirely upon third party telecommunications network providers to transmit data between america online s servers in the us and our members and content providers in brazil  mexico and argentina 
if these third party telecommunications networks do not function properly  the quality of our 
table of contents online services  or even our ability to deliver our online services  would be compromised  which would adversely affect our business 
our primary areas of concern involve the capacity and reliability of these networks 
we anticipate that we will need to enter into additional network contracts 
if our third party network providers lack the capacity to accommodate a rapid increase in use of our online services  members may encounter delays in accessing and using our online services 
in addition  if our third party telecommunications network providers experience severe financial difficulties  our service could be interrupted 
underdeveloped local and long distance telephone service may limit the growth of the internet in latin america  which will harm our ability to generate revenues from our interactive services if improvements to and expansion of the latin american local and long distance telephone service are not continued  our ability to deliver our interactive services to consumers and the market acceptance of online services and the internet in latin america will be jeopardized and our business will suffer 
members and users of our interactive services initiate access through local and long distance telephone lines 
local and long distance telephone service in latin america is significantly less developed than in the us the quality and availability of local and long distance telephone service may vary considerably within a particular country  which may affect the rate at which we are able to expand our interactive services to potential consumers on a national scale 
moreover  adequate quantities of local and regional telephone lines may not be readily available should online service and internet use increase more rapidly than anticipated 
past and future media coverage could adversely affect consumer acceptance of our interactive services  which could negatively impact our ability to acquire market share and generate revenues the interactive services industry  including our company  experiences heightened media coverage 
past and future media coverage of our company and our interactive services could adversely affect consumer acceptance of our interactive services 
our servers  which are owned and maintained by america online  may be subject to system failures  computer viruses or other unanticipated problems that may damage our reputation and result in a loss of members and in a decrease in use of our portals any damage to or failure of america online s servers could adversely impact our business 
the host computers that run our interactive services  which we refer to as our servers  are owned and maintained by america online in three locations within the us our operations  therefore  depend entirely on america online s ability to protect this equipment and the information stored there against events such as damage by fire  power loss  failures by third party service providers  computer viruses and unauthorized intrusions 
if the cost of local access calls does not continue to decline in latin america  the market for our services may be limited  which could reduce our revenues from subscription fees unlike in the us  local calls are metered in many latin american countries and online service and internet users pay for internet access fees as well as local calls that connect them to an internet access provider 
we believe this has had a negative impact on the growth of online services and internet use in latin america 
if telephone call charges do not continue to decrease  our revenues may decline because consumers may be unwilling to pay both subscription fees for internet access and fees for local calls 
if we fail to adapt our online services to accommodate faster methods of internet access or if we fail to offer new technologies  we may lose members or fail to attract new members and our revenues may decline unless we can accommodate high speed internet and online service access  new technologies  such as tv and wireless based services  and operating system platforms other than windows  windows  windows  windows me and windows xp  our interactive services will be less appealing to consumers and our revenues may decline 
we expect high speed internet and online service access to 
table of contents become more widely available in latin america 
we will be at a competitive disadvantage if we cannot allow our members to connect to our online services at these higher speeds or over new technologies 
to date  we have not offered high speed internet access services 
we may become subject to burdensome government regulations affecting interactive services  which could increase our costs of doing business or impair our ability to generate revenues the legal and regulatory environment that pertains to interactive services in latin america remains uncertain and may change 
latin american countries may adopt laws and regulations or apply existing laws to interactive services  including commerce and online service and internet advertising 
uncertainty and new regulations could increase our costs  prevent us from delivering our interactive services and slow the growth of the internet significantly  which could delay growth in demand for our interactive services and limit our ability to generate revenues 
new and existing laws and the interpretation of existing laws may cover issues such as copyright  trademark and patent infringement  access to networks  sales and other taxes  content provided on our services  user privacy and data protection  pricing controls and cross border commerce 
reduced sales of personal computers in latin america may impact the potential market for subscribers to our aola country services growth in subscription revenues may be negatively impacted by the slowdown in sales of personal computers which has taken place throughout most of latin america as a result of recent economic volatility 
the lower growth in the number of personal computers may hamper our ability to attract new subscribers to our aola country services at rates which we expected 
because our licensed rights to america online s trademarks and domain names are a valuable asset and integral to our brand identity  unauthorized use of intellectual property that we license from america online could lead to public confusion about our brand and adversely affect our business america online s or our own inability to protect our licensed rights to america online s trademarks and domain names against infringement or misappropriation could lead to public confusion about our brand and adversely affect our business 
for example  america online experienced difficulty in obtaining the rights to the domain name www 
aol 
com 
br in brazil 
similarly  in brazil  mexico and argentina  america online has initiated opposition proceedings to prevent registration of marks by third parties that are confusingly similar to america online s marks 
we cannot assure that america online will prevail in any legal proceedings or be able to register successfully all of the domain names that relate to its trademarks 
because credit card penetration in latin america is limited  our ability to attract members who pay on a timely basis may be affected credit card penetration in the markets we serve in latin america is significantly lower than in the united states 
this limits the number of potential subscribers to our aola country services who could pay by credit card 
we have had difficulty collecting payments from subscribers who pay be means other than credit cards 
if we are not able to satisfy the continued listing requirements of the nasdaq smallcap market  our class a common stock could be delisted resulting in reduced liquidity for our stockholders and a possible lower stock price our class a common stock is currently not in compliance with nasdaq s required minimum bid price of 
the closing bid price of our class a common stock must be above for at least ten consecutive trading days starting no later than june  or our class a common stock will be delisted from the nasdaq smallcap market 
in addition  in the past  we have had difficulty complying with other 
table of contents nasdaq listing requirements 
if our stock were delisted from the nasdaq smallcap market  our stockholders could have reduced liquidity and the price of our stock could decrease 
we have a number of arrangements with telecommunications network providers that have not been formalized 
we have several arrangements with telecommunications providers that have not been memorialized in written contracts 
as a result  these telecommunication providers could attempt to change the terms under which they provide service to us or terminate their relationship with us at any time 
in addition  a change in telecommunications regulations could encourage these providers to attempt to change the terms under which they provide service or terminate their relationships with us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our reporting currency is the us dollar 
however  most of our revenues are received in the currencies of the countries in which we offer our interactive services 
the currencies of many latin american countries  including brazil  mexico  and argentina  have recently experienced substantial volatility  including devaluation of their currencies 
from january  through march   the brazilian real devalued and the argentine peso devalued from january  the date of resumption of trading in the argentine peso 
the mexican pesos devalued by approximately from january  through march  if the currencies of the countries in which we operate depreciate and we do not or are not able to increase our prices  our revenues from our services will decline in us dollar terms 
due to our constantly changing currency exposure and the substantial potential volatility of currency exchange rates  we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our business 
however  we believe that to the extent that we have expenses in excess of revenues in each of our principal currencies  our economic exposure to currency fluctuations will be reduced 
therefore  to date  we have not tried to limit our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations by using foreign currency forward exchange contracts for hedging 
our business may be adversely affected as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations if we fail to enter into economic hedging transactions 
future currency exchange losses may be increased if we become subject to exchange control regulations restricting our ability to convert local currencies into us dollars 
recent developments in argentina s economic and political arenas suggest a continued risk of further currency devaluation 
as of december   we had net tangible assets in argentina totaling approximately million  of which approximately million is related to a vat receivable from the argentine government 
the short term portion of the vat receivable  which is equal to million  is classified under other receivables in current assets while the long term portion  which is equal to million  is classified under other assets in the consolidated balance sheet at december  this vat receivable is not subject to expiration  although its value is exposed to the fluctuation of the value of the argentine peso 
to date  our consolidated results of operations have not been materially impacted by inflation  although rates of inflation have been increasing recently 
inflation was in brazil during calendar  an increase from in calendar inflation in argentina from january through february reached a cumulative 
we are exposed to market risk as it relates to changes in the market value of our investments 
as of december   we had no material investments in marketable securities
