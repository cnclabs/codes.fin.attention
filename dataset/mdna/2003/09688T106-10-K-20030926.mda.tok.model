item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of the company  which are included later herein 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and costs and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those relating to revenue recognition  bad debts  inventories  property and equipment  goodwill and intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations  contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
the securities and exchange commission sec has requested that all registrants list their most critical accounting policies in md a 
the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial position and results of operations and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company believes that the following accounting policies fit this definition revenue recognition for premier club initiation fees revenue from premier club nonrefundable initial membership fees is deferred and recognized ratably over the average expected life of the memberships  which has been estimated to be eight years 
the average estimated life is based on management s best estimate using company specific historical information 
the company has not changed the estimated life used to recognize the premier club membership initiation fees since adoption in january when premier club membership initiation fees became nonrefundable  but would revise such estimate if  in management s opinion  changing trends in membership experience warrant such a change 

table of contents intangible assets intangible assets consist of goodwill  which represents the excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets of the acquired business  as well as  identified intangible assets with indefinite lives 
on july   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets which states  among other things  that goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its estimated useful life 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill that is not subject to amortization is tested for impairment annually using a two step impairment assessment 
impairment testing must be performed more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the company tested for potential impairment  both upon adoption of sfas no 
and annually as of july  and the company had no impairment of goodwill for the years ended june  and or at july  long lived assets and assets to be disposed of the carrying value of long lived assets is reviewed if the facts and circumstances suggest that they may be impaired 
if this review indicates that long lived assets will not be recoverable based on the undiscounted cash flows of the entity over the remaining amortization period  the carrying value of the long lived assets will be reduced by the amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair value 
fair value is determined using management s best estimate of the discounted net operating cash flows over the remaining life of the assets 
property and equipment expenditures for maintenance  repairs and renewals of items that do not extend the service life or increase the capacity of assets are charged to expense as incurred 
significant additions  along with interest incurred during the construction period for expansion at the company s properties  are capitalized 
depreciation and amortization has been computed using the straight line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives or  in the case of leasehold agreements  the term of the leasehold agreement as follows years building and improvements land improvements leasehold improvements furniture  fixtures and equipment business philosophy the company s business strategy is to focus on internal expansion and development opportunities at its existing resort properties 
however  management continuously evaluates ownership  acquisition and divestiture alternatives with the intention of maximizing shareholder value 
seasonality the resort operations are generally seasonal 
the resorts historically experience greater revenue  costs and income in the second and third quarters of the fiscal year ended june due to increased occupancy and room rates during the winter months 
historically    and of annual revenue has been derived during the first  second  third and fourth fiscal quarters  respectively 
events of september  during the three month period following the september  terrorist attacks on new york s world trade center towers and on the pentagon  the company s results of operations were adversely affected by travel disruption and short term cancellation of group bookings at its properties 
the company s operating results continue to track modestly below pre september  levels 

table of contents impact of inflation inflation and changing prices have not had a material impact on the company s revenue and results of operations 
based on the current economic climate  the company does not expect that inflation and changing prices will have a material impact on the company s revenue or income during the fiscal year 
many of the costs of operating the resorts can be fixed for certain periods of time  reducing the short term effects of changes in the rate of inflation 
room rates  which are set on a daily basis  can be rapidly changed to meet changes in inflation rates as well as other changing market conditions 
the company has less flexibility in changing group rates since group reservations are typically made to months in advance of the stay 
to the extent inflationary trends affect short term interest rates  a portion of the company s debt service costs may be adversely affected 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  included later herein 
non gaap financial measures this annual report on form k contains a non gaap financial measure  within the meaning of applicable sec rules  which we believe is useful to investors 
this financial measure is earnings before extraordinary and non recurring items  interest expense  interest income  income taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
ebitda is used by management  the lodging industry and certain investors as an indicator of the company s historical ability to service debt  to sustain potential future increases in debt and to satisfy capital requirements 
however  ebitda is not intended to represent cash flows for the period 
in addition  it has not been presented as an alternative to either a operating income as determined by gaap as an indicator of operating performance or b cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities as determined by gaap and is thus susceptible to varying calculations 
ebitda as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the new rules apply to the classification and impairment analysis conducted on long lived assets other than intangible assets and was adopted by the company on july  the new rules provide a single accounting treatment for the impairment of long lived assets and implementation guidance regarding impairment calculations

the adoption of sfas no

in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 which rescinds sfas no 
 reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt 
previously  sfas no 
required all gains and losses from extinguishment of debt to be aggregated and  if material  classified as an extraordinary item  net of related income tax effect 
under sfas no 
 gains and losses from extinguishment of debt are classified as extraordinary items only if they meet the criteria in apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations discontinued events and extraordinary items 
applying the provisions of apb opinion no 
distinguishes transactions that are part of an entity s recurring operations from those that are unusual or infrequent  or that meet the criteria for classification as an extraordinary item 
the company adopted sfas no 
on july  accordingly  losses on the retirement of debt that were classified as an extraordinary item in the prior periods presented  have been reclassified to recurring operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity 
the provisions of this statement are effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after march  this statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under issue  a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial position 

table of contents in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  an interpretation of sfas no 
  and and rescission of fin 
fin addresses the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees 
it also requires that a guarantor recognize a liability  at the inception of a guarantee  for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the initial measurement and recognition provisions of fin are effective for guarantees issued or modified after december  the adoption of fin did not impact the company s results of operations or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
this statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based compensation and the effect of the method used on reporting results 
the provisions of this statement have been incorporated into this annual report on form k 
see note in january  the fasb issued fin consolidations of variable interest entities 
this interpretation requires a company to consolidate variable interest entities vie if the enterprise is a primary beneficiary holds a majority of the variable interest of the vie and the vie possesses specific characteristics 
it also requires additional disclosure for parties involved with vies 
since the company does not have any unconsolidated vies  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial position
