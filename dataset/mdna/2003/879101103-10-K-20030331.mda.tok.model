item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with  and is qualified in its entirety by  the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this annual report on form k 
historical results and percentage relationships among any amounts in the financial statements are not necessarily indicative of trends in operating results for any future periods 
overview on august   we completed the sale of our network diagnostics division ndd to catapult communications corporation catapult for million  consisting of million in cash and convertible subordinated promissory notes issued by catapult s wholly owned irish subsidiary and guaranteed by catapult in the total amount of million  subject to certain adjustments 
the sale of ndd resulted in a pre tax gain of approximately million million after income taxes and was accounted for as a discontinued operation in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
accordingly our historical financial results have been revised to reflect ndd as a discontinued operation 
our product offerings are currently organized into two distinct product lines network systems and contact center 
network systems 
our network systems product line consists principally of the eagle sas and products  features and applications based on the eagle platform  including tekware and tekserver  the ip secure gateway and our local number portability solution  sentinel  asi service control point  vxi media gateway controller and other convergence products 
contact center 
our iex contact center products provide planning  management and call routing and control tools for single contact centers and for complex  multiple site contact center environments 
this product line includes the totalview workforce management and totalnet call routing solutions 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires making estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  estimates are evaluated  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  investments  deferred taxes  notes receivable  impairment of long lived assets  product warranty  and contingencies and litigation 
these estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 

table of contents we apply the following critical accounting policies in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition policy 
revenues are derived from sales of network systems products and contact center products 
revenues are recognized upon the transfer of title  generally at the time of shipment to the customer s final site and satisfaction of related company obligations  if any  provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed and determinable and collectability is deemed probable 
for certain products  our sales arrangements include acceptance provisions which are based on our published specifications and are accounted for as warranty  provided that we have previously demonstrated that the product meets the specified criteria and has established a history with substantially similar transactions 
revenue is deferred for sales arrangements that include customer specific acceptance provisions where we are unable to reliably demonstrate that the delivered product meets all of the specified criteria until customer acceptance is obtained 
revenues associated with multiple element arrangements are allocated to each element based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value 
revenues associated with installation services  if provided  are deferred based on the fair value of such services and are recognized upon completion 
revenue is recognized for maintenance agreements ratably over the contract term 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories 
inventory levels are based on projections of future demand and market conditions 
any sudden decline in demand and or rapid product improvements and technological changes can result in excess and or obsolete inventories 
on an ongoing basis inventories are reviewed and written down for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventories equal to the difference between the costs of inventories and the estimated net realizable value based upon forecasts for future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than our forecasts  additional inventory reserves may be required 
estimates could be influenced by sudden decline in demand due to economic downturn  rapid product improvements and technological changes 
investments 
an impairment charge is recorded when an asset has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
deferred taxes 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have evaluated our deferred tax assets and liabilities and we have determined that no valuation allowance is necessary 
should it be determined that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would reduce income in the period such determination was made 

table of contents notes receivable 
the notes are reflected in the balance sheet at their estimated fair value determined by a third party appraisal which computed the fair value by discounting the face value amount to present value using a fair value rate of interest and then determining the fair value of the conversion option using the black scholes valuation model 
the fair value of the notes is being adjusted for the amortization to the redemption amount at maturity 
see note b disposition of network diagnostics business 
goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
eliminated the amortization of goodwill 
instead  goodwill is reviewed for impairment upon adoption and at least annually thereafter 
in connection with the initial impairment tests  we obtained valuations of our individual reporting units from an independent third party valuation firm 
the valuation methodologies included  but were not limited to  estimated net present value of the projected cash flows of these reporting units 
as a result of these initial impairment tests  we determined that there was no goodwill impairment 
if actual results are substantially lower than our projections underlying these valuations  or if market discount rates increase  this could adversely affect our future valuations and result in additional future impairment charges 
we assess potential impairment of our goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets when there is evidence that recent events or changes in circumstances have made recovery of an asset s carrying value unlikely and at least annually for goodwill 
the amount of an impairment loss would be recognized as the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value 
factors we consider important  which may cause an impairment include significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired asset  negative industry or economic trends  and significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results 
product warranty 
our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting product failures 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
we generally warrant our products against defects in materials and workmanship for one year after sale and provide for estimated future warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized 
commitments and contingencies 
we evaluate contingent liabilities including threatened or pending litigation in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies and record accruals when the outcome of these matters is deemed probable and the liability is reasonably estimable 
we make these assessments based on the facts and circumstances and in some instances based in part on the advice of outside legal counsel

our revenues increased by million  or  during due primarily to higher sales of network systems products and services 

table of contents revenues from network systems products increased by million  or  due primarily to higher sales of eagle stp products and secondarily to higher sales of sentinel products 
revenues from contact center products increased by  or  primarily as a result of increased sales of the totalview product

revenues in europe increased by million  or  due primarily to stronger sales of eagle stp products 
rest of world revenues decreased by million or due primarily to lower sales of eagle stp products 
we believe that our future revenue growth depends in large part upon a number of factors  including the continued market acceptance  both domestically and internationally  of our products  particularly the eagle products and related applications as well as our suite of products for converged circuit and packet networks  including the ip secure gateway and vxi media gateway controller network systems products 
gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to in compared with in the increase in gross margins was due primarily to a higher proportion of sales of eagle stp upgrades and extensions and service agreements  which typically carry higher margins 
changes in the following factors  among others  may affect gross profit product and distribution channel mix  competition  customer discounts  supply and demand conditions in the electronic components industry  internal manufacturing capabilities and efficiencies  foreign currency fluctuations  and general economic conditions 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased overall by million  or  and increased slightly as a percentage of revenues to in from in the dollar increase was due primarily to an increase in variable compensation expense 
we intend to continue to make substantial investments in product and technology development and we believe that our future success depends in a large part upon our ability to continue to enhance existing products and to develop or acquire new products that maintain our technological competitiveness 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  and increased as a percentage of revenues to in from in the dollar increase was due primarily to an increase in compensation costs  including a million charge for the accrual of retirement benefits for our former chief executive officer who retired in february  comprised of a million non cash stock based compensation charge for the modification of certain stock option awards to allow for the extension of the exercise period upon qualified retirement from days to the remaining contracted term of the options  a  one time cash severance payment and  for post retirement health benefits

excluding the effect of acquisition related items  our effective tax rate was in and and represented federal  state and foreign taxes on our income  reduced primarily by research and development credits  foreign tax credits and other benefits from foreign sourced income 
we expect that our effective tax rate  excluding the effect of acquisition related items  will remain relatively consistent with and within the range of the effective tax rates in prior years 
changes in the tax rate can be affected by changes in the mix of international sales and changes in the amount of the research and development credits 
loss from discontinued operation 
loss from our discontinued operation increased to million for compared to a loss from discontinued operation of  for the increased loss was a result of reduced sales and operating results for our network diagnostics division sold in august of gain on disposal of discontinued operation

deferred revenue decreased by during due primarily to an increase in revenue recognized for transactions that completed acceptance or delivery requirements 
net capital expenditures of million during represented the planned addition of equipment principally for research and development and manufacturing operations 
we have a million line of credit with a us bank 
our million credit facility is collateralized by substantially all of our assets  bears interest at or  in some cases  below the lender s prime rate at december   and expires on august   if not renewed 
under the terms of this facility  we are required to maintain certain financial ratios and meet certain net worth and indebtedness covenants 
we believe we are in compliance with these requirements 
there have been no borrowings under this credit facility 
in november  we completed the private placement of million principal amount at maturity of convertible subordinated discount notes due in  issued at of their face amount equivalent to gross proceeds of approximately million at issuance before discounts and expenses 
these notes became callable in november  we believe that existing working capital  funds generated through operations  and its current bank credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy operating requirements for at least the next twelve months 
nonetheless  we may seek additional sources of capital as necessary or appropriate to fund acquisitions or to otherwise finance our growth or operations  however  there can be no assurance that such funds  if needed  will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
future payments due under debt and lease obligations as of december  in thousands convertible non subordinated cancelable notes due operating leases total and thereafter we will make interest payments of million in both and financial risk our international sales are predominantly denominated in us dollars  and therefore exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations on international sales is limited 
in certain instances where we have entered into contracts that are denominated in foreign currencies  we have obtained foreign currency forward and option contracts  principally denominated in euros 
table of contents or british pounds  to offset the impact of currency rates on accounts receivable 
we had no forward or option contracts outstanding as of december  and december  we do not enter into derivative instrument transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
we do not hedge foreign currencies in a manner that would entirely eliminate the effects of the changes in foreign currency rates on our consolidated net income 
fixed income securities are subject to interest rate risk 
the fair value of our investment portfolio would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the short term nature of the major portion of our investment portfolio 
the portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment grade securities to minimize credit risk 
there have been no borrowings under our variable rate credit facilities 
all of our outstanding long term debt is fixed rate and not subject to interest rate fluctuation 
with respect to trade receivables  we design  manufacture  market and support network systems products and selected service applications for telecommunications networks and contact centers 
our customers include telecommunications carriers  network providers  and contact center operators 
credit is extended based on an evaluation of each customer s financial condition  and generally collateral is not required 
generally  payment terms stipulate payment within days of shipment and currently  we doe not engage in leasing or other customer financing arrangements 
many of our international sales are secured with import insurance or letters of credit to mitigate credit risk 
although we have processes in place to monitor and mitigate credit risk  there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in eliminating such risk 
historically  credit losses have been within management s expectations and relatively insignificant 
our exposure to credit risk has increased as a result of weakened financial conditions in certain market segments such as the competitive local exchange carrier segment 
credit losses for such customers have been provided for in the financial statements 
future losses  if incurred  could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows
