item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form k 
this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
all of these statements are based on information available to us as of the date hereof  and we assume no obligation to update any forward looking statements 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of certain risk factors including  but not limited to  those discussed under the heading factors that may affect future results 
overview we provide software products that enable organizations to effectively manage their database infrastructure and manage the underlying data housed within that infrastructure 
our database administration  enterprise data architecture  enterprise data integration and performance management products offer customers comprehensive solutions for managing the database life cycle  which is the process of creating  optimizing and managing the databases that underlie critical business applications 
by simplifying the management of the database life cycle  our products allow organizations to ensure the availability  performance and reliability of their critical business applications and to maximize the value they extract from their corporate data 
we were incorporated in california as client worx  inc in july and changed our name to embarcadero technologies  inc in october we reincorporated in delaware in february and completed our initial public offering in april sources of revenue and revenue recognition policy revenues are primarily derived from software license fees and related maintenance and support contracts 
revenues from software license fees are recognized upon shipment  when terms are fob shipping point  provided that evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
maintenance and support contracts generally cover a one year term and are paid for in advance 
revenues from maintenance and support contracts are recognized ratably over the contract term 
we use a purchase order  a pre payment via check  wire or credit card  a signed license agreement or other persuasive evidence as substantiation of an arrangement 
for arrangements with multiple obligations eg undelivered maintenance and support contracts and consulting and training services bundled with licenses  we allocate revenue to the delivered elements of the arrangement using the residual value method based on objective evidence of the fair value of the undelivered elements  which is specific to us 
the vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for maintenance and support obligations related to licenses is based upon the prices paid for the separate renewal of these services by the customer 
vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of other services  primarily consulting and training services  is based upon separate sales of those services 
customers are generally granted payment terms of net thirty days  but some payments are collected via check  wire or credit card at the time an order is placed 
products may be sold through resellers and distributors in the united states and certain international markets 

table of contents revenues from software license fees and maintenance contracts sold through resellers or distributors are recognized on the sell through method 
distributors purchase products to fulfill specific customer orders and generally do not hold inventory of our products 
license revenues include the nominal shipping and handling charges associated with most license orders 
actual shipping costs that we incur are included in cost of revenue 
we sell our software and related maintenance services directly through our telesales and field sales organizations in the united states and the united kingdom  and indirectly through our distribution partners worldwide 
we intend to continue to expand our international sales activities in an effort to increase revenues from foreign sales 
our license and maintenance revenues  results of operations  cash flows from operations and financial condition could be adversely affected in future periods by a continued downturn in global economic conditions as well as increased competitive pressures

table of contents years ended december   and revenues total revenues 
total revenues were million  million and million for  and  respectively  representing a decrease of from to and an increase of from to license 
license revenues were million  million and million for  and  respectively  representing a decrease of from to and an increase of from to the increase from to was due to an increase in the number of licenses sold  resulting from greater market acceptance of our products  greater breadth of product offerings and an increase in sales staff and sales staff productivity 
the decrease in license revenues from to was due to unfavorable changes in macro economic conditions and the resulting impact on it related spending 
customers have been faced with shrinking budgets and tighter internal spending controls  which has led to a reduction in it spending and has impacted not only our license sales but also those of the software industry as a whole 
future license revenues cannot be predicted and will vary based on it spending patterns  acceptance of our products  competitive conditions and other related factors 
maintenance 
maintenance revenues were million  million and million for  and  respectively  representing increases of from to and from to the increase in each year was due to increases in the number of licenses sold and the corresponding growth in our customer base and maintenance renewals 
the slow down in the rate of growth in correlates to the decrease in license revenues  as fewer license sales translated into fewer opportunities to sell the corresponding maintenance services 
maintenance revenues are a factor of both new licenses sold and the renewal rate for existing licenses 
future license sales as well as the percentage of existing license holders who opt to renew their maintenance agreements in the future will impact the growth rate of maintenance revenues 
cost of revenues license 
cost of license revenues consists primarily of amortization of capitalized research and development expenses  royalties  credit card merchant fees and product media and packaging 
cost of license revenues were   and  for  and  respectively  representing a decrease of from to and an increase of from to cost of license revenues represented  and of license revenues in  and  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars from to was due to an increase in the number of licenses sold 
the decrease in cost of license revenues in absolute dollars and as a percentage of license revenues from to was due primarily to a decrease in royalty expenses of approximately  a decrease in us credit card merchant fees of approximately  and a decrease of approximately  in us product media and packaging  partially offset by an increase of  in amortization related to capitalized research and development expenses 
cost of license revenues as a percentage of license revenues may vary in the future depending on the mix of internally developed versus externally licensed products and the volume and mix of completed license transactions 
additionally  if products for which some research and development costs have been capitalized come to market see capitalized software development costs in note to our consolidated financial statements  the related amortization expense over the life of the product will increase cost of license revenues in absolute dollars and may increase cost of license revenues as a percentage of license revenues 
amortization of acquired technology 
this amortization relates to technology acquired from third parties that was deemed to have reached technological feasibility at the date of acquisition and was therefore capitalized see capitalized software development costs in note to our consolidated financial statements 
this expense was million   and  for  and  respectively 
the million of amortization expense in consisted of  related to technology acquired in and but put into service in and  related to the acquisition of advanced software technologies  inc in the fourth quarter of in both and  the entire amortization expense related to the acquisition of advanced software technologies 
maintenance 
cost of maintenance revenues consists primarily of customer support personnel and related expenses  including payroll  employee benefits and 
table of contents allocated overhead 
cost of maintenance revenues were million  million and million for  and  respectively  representing increases of from to and from to cost of maintenance revenues represented  and of maintenance revenues in  and  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues from to was due primarily to an increase in the number of customer support personnel hired to service our expanding worldwide customer base and the associated increase in overhead allocation 
in  we increased maintenance revenues while keeping the number of related personnel flat  realizing economies of scale and increased utilization of the personnel hired in as we hire more support personnel to support our expanding product line and customer base  we expect cost of maintenance revenues to increase in absolute dollars and potentially to increase as a percentage of maintenance revenues if the additional personnel are hired in advance of an increase in the related revenues 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and related expenses  including payroll  employee benefits  allocated overhead and non cash stock based compensation  as well as expenses related to outside software development contractors 
research and development expenses were million  million and million for  and  respectively  representing a decrease of from to and an increase of from to as a percentage of total revenues  research and development expenses were  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues from to was due primarily to an increase in the number of personnel in our research and development organization  both domestically and in our research and development facility in canada  and the associated increase in overhead allocation  which in total increased by approximately million 
the increase in personnel was due to hiring as well as the inclusion of personnel absorbed through acquisitions in the fourth quarter of the increase as a percentage of revenues from to was due to the lower total revenues realized in in absolute dollars  research and development expenses were consistent from to we may increase research and development expenses in future periods if we hire additional research and development personnel  use more contractors and or choose to expand our product development activities 
purchased research and development 
purchased research and development consists of technology purchased from third parties 
from time to time  we purchase technology to supplement our research and development efforts and to leverage the resources available to us 
such purchases are for the rights  titles  and interest in the technology 
if we determine that the purchased software has not reached technological feasibility  we expense the cost of the technology in the year of the purchase see capitalized software development costs in note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of when purchased technology is expensed versus capitalized 
in  we spent million to purchase technology to incorporate into products that had not reached technological feasibility 
we had no alternative use for this purchased technology 
these products were subsequently released in  and there are no related contractual obligations for future purchases of technology 
no comparable expense was incurred in or we may choose to purchase additional technology in the future based on our development needs and our decisions to internally build technology versus purchase technology from third parties 
our past purchases and integration of research and development did not created a material strain on our financial or personnel resources 
however  if we choose to purchase additional research and development in the future  such purchases may have a material effect on our financial and or personnel resources 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel and related expenses  commissions earned by sales personnel  non cash stock based compensation  trade shows  travel and other marketing communication costs  such as advertising and other marketing programs 
sales and marketing expenses were million  million and million for  and  respectively  representing a decrease of from to and an increase of from to as a percentage of total revenues  sales and marketing expenses were  and in  and  respectively 
excluding non cash stock based compensation  sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues were  and 
table of contents in  and  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues from to was due to an increase in headcount and related expenses due to the expansion of our field sales organization 
the decrease in absolute dollars from to was due to a reduction in non cash stock based compensation of  as well as a decrease of approximately million in marketing costs due to reductions in discretionary marketing spending 
the decrease in these expenses was slightly offset by an increase in sales personnel and related expenses as we continued to build out our field sales organization 
we expect to release new products in when and if these products are released  we may increase our marketing efforts to promote the new products and hire new sales personnel to expand our sales capacity  which would lead to an increase in sales and marketing expense in future periods 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses  general operating expenses and non cash stock based compensation 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million for  and  respectively  representing decreases of from to and from to as a percentage of total revenues  general and administrative expenses were  and in  and  respectively 
excluding non cash stock based compensation  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues were  and in  and  respectively 
the decrease in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenues from to was due to a decrease in non cash stock based compensation of million that was partially offset by an increase in the bad debt reserve of  and an increase of approximately  in director s and officer s insurance expense 
additionally  there was an increase of approximately  due to the inclusion of a full year of general and administrative expenses from our european subsidiary  which was acquired in the fourth quarter of the decrease in absolute dollars from to was due to a million decrease in non cash stock based compensation that was partially offset by an increase in expenses in our european subsidiary of approximately  general and administrative expenses  excluding amortization of non cash stock based compensation  may increase in absolute dollars if we need to expand our administrative staff and facilities to support future growth in our operations 
purchased in process research and development 
in november  we acquired advanced software technologies  inc for million in cash 
in connection with this acquisition  we expensed million of purchased in process research and development 
the in process technology related to two identifiable projects a major version release of advanced software technologies gdpro product project a and a new software product featuring design and documentation features project b 
the purchased in process research and development for each project was  and  respectively 
the projects were approximately and complete  respectively  at the time of the acquisitions  with significant remaining development efforts necessary to complete the projects 
these efforts included enhancing and broadening support of large team  multi user functions  broadening use to integrated development environments  and integrating these products with our existing technology 
in june  we completed project a and  in conjunction with its general release  we renamed gdpro as describe 
due to a change in our development priorities  we ceased development efforts on project b in june there were no additional obligations associated with project b at that date 
also in november  we acquired engineeringperformance  inc for million in cash and  shares of our common stock 
in connection with this acquisition  we expensed million of purchased in process research and development 
the in process technology related to a software product that is designed to be used to test and analyze the performance of e business applications 
the project was approximately complete at the time of the acquisition  with significant remaining development efforts necessary to complete the project 
these efforts included extending support to cover all industry standard protocols and maximizing capability and compatibility across multiple platforms 
in order to enhance the scope of this project  we have significantly expanded development efforts since the acquisition 
the expanded requirements have pushed the release date of the project from to the second half of we believe the development effort required to complete the project and the associated delay has not had a material effect on our return on investment projections 
the values assigned to the in process research and development described above were based on 
table of contents established valuation techniques 
at the time of the acquisitions  the in process research and development was expensed as a non recurring charge  as the in process technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
the fair value allocation to in process research and development was determined by identifying the research project for each acquisition for which technological feasibility had not been achieved and which had no alternative future use at the acquisition date  estimating the additional costs to be incurred to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products  assessing the stage and expected date of completion of the research and development effort at the acquisition date  and estimating the resulting net cash flows  and then estimating the net present value of the cash flows back to their present value 
the discount rate includes a risk adjusted rate to take into account the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the purchased in process technology 
the discount rate applied to the project cash flows was for the in process technology of advanced software technologies  inc and for engineeringperformance  inc 
the valuation for advanced software technologies  inc includes cash inflows from in process technology through with revenues projected to commence in and from the respective projects 
when performed  the valuation for engineeringperformance  inc included cash inflows from in process technology through with revenues projected to commence in we believe that the estimated in process technology amounts represent fair value and do not exceed the amount a third party would pay for the projects 
we had no charges for purchased in process research and development in or purchased in process research and development costs in future years will depend entirely upon acquisition activities and cannot be estimated in advance of an acquisition 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets 
in connection with the acquisitions of advanced software technologies  inc  engineeringperformance  inc  and the remaining of embarcadero europe ltd  we recorded million of goodwill and other intangible assets in the fourth quarter of the total related amortization expense in  and was million  million and  respectively 
  and  of this amortization expense was recorded as cost of license revenues in  and  respectively 
the remaining million  million and  of expense in  and  respectively  was recorded as an operating expense and includes goodwill amortization of million and  in and  respectively 
we ceased amortization of goodwill when we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
effective january  see goodwill in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment test on september  the results of the analysis showed that goodwill was not impaired 
going forward  we will test our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or in the event of a significant change in our business 
if  in the future  we determine that our goodwill is impaired  we will be required to take a non recurring charge at the date of impairment to write down this asset 
the dollar amount of such potential future charge  if any  cannot currently be estimated 
the amortization expense associated with the intangible assets of million  net related to acquired technology is expected to be  in and  in and will be recorded as cost of license revenues 
lease related impairment loss 
in  we recorded an impairment loss of million related to office leases in san francisco and boston when we decided to abandon and sublease these office spaces in order to streamline operations 
the impairment loss consists of approximately million in contractual obligations under the facilities leases  net of estimated sublease income from the projected date of abandonment to the end of the lease term 
the remaining  consists of write downs to leasehold improvements and other assets attributable to the abandoned space  as well as other expenses related to securing the sublease arrangements 
when we recorded the lease related impairment loss  we made estimates about sublease costs and income 
in  based on changes in the commercial real estate market in san francisco  we recorded an additional  in impairment charges to cover lower than expected sublease income 
at december  we had a balance of  in accrued restructuring costs for future facilities lease charges 
the san francisco leases expire in  and the boston leases expire in each reporting period we will review these estimates and  to the extent that 
table of contents these assumptions change due to unfavorable changes in the market  the ultimate restructuring expenses for these abandoned facilities could increase in the future 
other income  net 
other income  net consists primarily of interest income and was  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease from to was due to a significant decrease in interest rates  which negatively impacted our interest income 
provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes was  in   in and million in the effective income tax rate was  and in  and  respectively 
the decrease from to is primarily the result of an increase in research and development tax credits resulting from increases in qualified research and development expenses 
the decrease in the tax provision from to is due a reduction in amortization expense for items that are not deductible for federal and state income tax purposes  including amortization of deferred stock based compensation and goodwill 
share in loss of joint venture and affiliated company 
in september  we formed a joint venture with aztec software  inc  a california corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of aztec software and technology services limited  an indian company publicly traded on the bombay stock exchange 
in accordance with the terms of the agreement  embarcadero and aztec software  inc each contributed million to the venture 
we account for this venture under the equity method of accounting see basis of presentation in note to our consolidated financial statements 
for our fifty percent share in the loss of the venture in the years ended december  and  we recorded  net of a tax benefit of  and  net of a tax expense of  respectively  as a loss from joint venture and affiliated company in our consolidated statements of operations 
as of december   our investment in this entity was zero and we had no remaining commitments to the entity 
we do not expect to realize any future income from our investment in this entity 
liquidity and capital resources we have funded our business to date from cash generated by our operations and proceeds from sales of equity 
in april  we completed our initial public offering of common stock  generating net proceeds to us of approximately million 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the million decrease from to resulted from a million decrease in non cash depreciation and amortization charges  a million decrease in the tax benefit from disqualifying dispositions of stock options and a million decrease in non cash lease impairment charges in  offset by a million increase in net income and a  net increase in deferred income taxes 
the  decrease from to resulted from a million decrease due to the purchase of in process technology related to our acquisitions in and a million decrease in the tax benefit from disqualifying dispositions of stock options  offset by a decrease in net loss of million  an increase in non cash depreciation and amortization charges of  a million net increase in operating assets and liabilities  a million lease related impairment loss in and a  increase in share in loss of affiliated company 
in  our net income was reduced by a number of non cash expense items 
these items include depreciation and amortization of property and equipment and intangible assets  amortization of deferred stock based compensation and provisions for doubtful accounts 
to the extent that these non cash items increase or decrease and positively or negatively impact our future operating results  there will be no corresponding impact on our cash flows 
our primary source of operating cash flow is the collection of accounts receivable from our customers and the timing of payments to our vendors and service providers 
we measure the effectiveness of our collections efforts by an analysis of average accounts receivable days outstanding days outstanding 
collections of accounts receivable and related days outstanding will fluctuate in future periods due to the timing and amount of our future revenues  payment terms extended to our customers and the effectiveness of our collection efforts 
our operating cash flows may be impacted in the future by the timing of payments to our vendors for accounts payable 
we typically pay our vendors and service 
table of contents providers in accordance with their invoice terms and conditions 
the timing of cash payments in future periods will be impacted by the nature of accounts payable arrangements and management s assessment of our cash inflows 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
in all three years  cash used in investing activities included cash used to purchase property and equipment 
in and  million  net and million  net  respectively  was used to purchase short term investments  and  and million  respectively  was used to acquire technology 
in each of and   was invested in a joint venture see note to our consolidated financial statements 
in  million was used to make deferred payments in connection with acquisitions made in in  million of cash was used to acquire other entities as described below 
we do not have any further deferred payments related to our past acquisitions 
we may continue to invest in short term investments  and we may acquire additional technology in the future 
in october  we acquired the remaining interest in our affiliate  embarcadero europe ltd  for million in cash 
in november  we acquired advanced software technologies  inc  based in littleton  colorado  for million in cash 
also in november  we acquired engineeringperformance  inc  based in toronto  canada  for approximately million in cash and  shares of our common stock valued at approximately million 
net cash provided by used in financing activities was million in   in  and million in in and  million and million  respectively  was used to repurchase our common stock 
this use of cash was partially offset in and by  and million  respectively  provided by exercises of stock options under our stock option plan 
net cash provided by financing activities in came predominately from million in net proceeds from our initial public offering of common stock and to a lesser extent from the proceeds from the sale of our series a preferred stock and the exercise of stock options under our stock option plan 
since december  we have continued to use cash to buy back shares of our common stock and we may continue to do so in the future 
we have a million revolving credit facility with a bank that bears interest at the prime rate and expires on june  this facility requires that we maintain various quarterly financial covenants including covenants related to tangible net worth  total liabilities and profitability 
at december  we were in compliance with all covenants and had no amounts outstanding under this credit facility 
we have no immediate plans to borrow any amounts under this credit facility 
we had net deferred tax assets totaling million at december  we believe that these assets will be realizable in the future 
in september  our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to  shares of our common stock 
in july  our board of directors amended the stock repurchase program  allowing us to repurchase  shares from that date forward 
in the year ended december   we repurchased approximately  shares at a cost of approximately million 
at december   our only contractual obligations consisted of facility lease commitments and operating leases for office equipment 
future minimum lease payments are as follows in thousands year ending december  operating leases thereafter total minimum lease payments 
table of contents we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to finance our operations through at least the next to months 
if we fail to generate cash flow from operations in the future due to an unexpected decline in revenues or due to a sustained increase in cash expenditures in excess of revenues generated  our cash balances may not be sufficient to fund continuing operations without obtaining additional financing 
if additional financing is needed  there can be no assurance that such financing will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
critical accounting policies a detailed discussion of our significant accounting policies can be found in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the impacts and risks associated with our accounting policies are discussed throughout this annual report on form k and in the notes to the financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those that require significant judgment and or estimates by management at the time that financial statements are prepared such that materially different results might have been reported if other assumptions had been made 
below is further discussion of the polices that we consider to be our critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
our revenues are principally derived from software license sales and related maintenance and support contracts 
customers that license our software products also generally purchase maintenance and support contracts that provide software updates and technical support over a stated term  usually one year 
we sell packaged software products that generally do not require us to perform any special installation or integration services 
we primarily sell our products through our direct sales force 
our products are sold under a perpetual license model 
updates and upgrades to our products are made available to customers who have purchased maintenance and support contracts 
we do not recognize revenues for refundable fees or agreements with cancellation rights until such rights to refund or cancellation have expired 
we recognize revenues in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop and sop we recognize revenues when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  typically upon shipment  when terms are fob shipping point  no significant implementation obligations by us remain  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is probable 
at the time of the transaction  we assess whether the fee associated with our revenue transactions is fixed and determinable and whether or not collection is probable 
we assess whether the fee is fixed and determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
if a significant portion of a fee is due after our normal payment terms  which are typically days from invoice date but in some cases may be or days  we account for the fee as not being fixed and determinable 
in these cases  we recognize revenue as the fees become due 
we assess collectibility based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
we do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not probable  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes probable  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
for arrangements with multiple obligations eg undelivered maintenance and support contracts and consulting and training services bundled with licenses  we allocate revenue to the delivered elements of the arrangement using the residual value method based on objective evidence of the fair value of the undelivered elements  which is specific to us 
the vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for the ongoing maintenance and support obligations for the licenses are based upon the prices paid for the separate renewal of these services by the customer 
vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of other services  primarily consulting and training services  is based upon separate sales of these services 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
deferred revenue  which consists primarily of maintenance and support services that customers have contracted for in advance but for which revenue has not been recognized  is recognized ratably over the maintenance and support term  typically one year  or as other requirements requiring deferral under sop are satisfied 

table of contents joint venture accounting 
we have a fifty percent interest in a joint venture that is primarily engaged in software development 
our investment in this joint venture is accounted for under the equity method of accounting and  accordingly  we recognize fifty percent of the income or loss from this venture in our consolidated statements of operations 
the joint venture was formed in the third quarter of and generated losses in and we have the right of first refusal to purchase any software developed by the joint venture 
if we exercise this right of first refusal  or if an independent third party purchases software from the joint venture  we will benefit in the form of income  or reduced loss  from the joint venture through our fifty percent interest in the venture 
if we purchase software from the joint venture that has reached technological feasibility in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
see discussion below under capitalized research and development costs  the costs will be recorded on our financial statements as capitalized research and development 
if the purchased software is not deemed to have reached technological feasibility  the costs will be recorded as purchased research and development expense 
aztec software  inc owns the remaining fifty percent interest in this venture 
in and  much of our purchased technology was acquired from aztec 
in addition  aztec is one of our customers 
all transactions with aztec were conducted at arms length and were recorded at their fair value 
capitalized research and development costs 
capitalized research and development costs include certain costs associated with acquiring and developing the technology used in our licensed products 
research and development costs are capitalized in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  which requires capitalization of research and development costs only after technological feasibility has been established 
we consider technological feasibility to have been established when a working model that includes all significant planned features and functionality exists 
accordingly  purchased technology is capitalized if it has reached technological feasibility at the time of acquisition  costs of developed technology are capitalized after technological feasibility is reached 
costs of purchased and developed technology are capitalized and amortized on a product by product basis over their remaining estimated useful lives at the greater of straight line or the ratio that current gross revenues for a product bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product 
amortization begins when technology is available for sale 
estimated useful lives of capitalized technology are generally three years 
our capitalized software costs were million  net at december  a discussion of our policies related to capitalized software can be found in note to our consolidated financial statements under the heading capitalized software development costs and further detail can be found in note to our consolidated financial statements 
lease related impairment loss 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  in the third quarter of we recorded a significant restructuring charge in connection with our abandonment of certain operating leases as part of a program to restructure our operations and related facilities 
lease abandonment costs were estimated to include the impairment of leasehold improvements  remaining lease liabilities and brokerage fees  offset by estimated sublease income 
estimates related to sublease costs and income are based on assumptions about the time period required to locate and contract with suitable sub lessees as well as the sublease rates that can be achieved  as determined by using market trend information analyses provided by a commercial real estate brokerage we retained 
in  based on changes in the commercial real estate market in san francisco  we recorded an additional impairment charges to cover lower than estimated sublease income 
we will continue to review these estimates each reporting period 
to the extent that these assumptions change due to unfavorable market conditions  the ultimate restructuring expenses for these abandoned facilities could increase by material amounts 
accounting for income taxes 
in conjunction with preparing our consolidated financial statements  we must estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in 
table of contents deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
at december   we had deferred tax assets of million due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward and research and other credits  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
a detailed discussion of our income tax provision and the components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities can be found in note to our consolidated financial statements 
accounting for stock based compensation 
our stock based employee compensation plans are described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we account for those plans under the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
and related interpretations 
stock based compensation cost is reflected in net income loss  as some options granted under those plans had an exercise price less than the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
we amortize stock based compensation using the straight line method over the remaining vesting periods of the related options  which are generally four years 
pro forma information regarding net income loss and net income loss per share is required 
this information is required in order to show our net income loss as if we had accounted for employee stock options under the fair value method of sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 and is contained in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the fair value of options and shares issued pursuant to the option plans at the grant date were estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
this model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
in addition  option pricing models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility 
we use projected volatility rates  which are based upon historical volatility rates trended into future years 
because our employee stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  in management s opinion  the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our options 
the effects of applying pro forma disclosures of net income loss and net income loss per share are not likely to be representative of the pro forma effects on net income and earnings per share in the future years for the following reasons the number of future shares to be issued under these plans is not known and the assumptions used to determine the fair value can vary significantly 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no

additionally sfas no 
expands the scope of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity with operations that a can be distinguished from the rest of the entity and b will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal transaction 
sfas no

in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
addresses significant issues regarding the recognition  measurement  and reporting of costs that are associated with exit and disposal activities  including restructuring activities that are currently accounted for under emerging issues task force eitf no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the scope of sfas no 
also includes costs related to terminating a contract that is not a capital lease and termination benefits that involuntarily terminated employees receive under the terms of a one time benefit arrangement that is not an ongoing benefit arrangement or an individual deferred compensation contract 
sfas no 
is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  we will adopt sfas no 
on january  sfas no 
prospectively changes the timing of when restructuring charges are recorded from the commitment date to the date that the liability is incurred 
we do not believe that the adoption of this standard will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires that a liability be recorded in the guarantor s balance sheet upon issuance of a guarantee 
in addition  fin requires disclosures about the guarantees that an entity has issued  including a reconciliation of changes in the entity s product warranty liabilities 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of fin are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   irrespective of the guarantor s fiscal year end 
the disclosure requirements of fin are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  we have adopted the disclosure requirements and are currently assessing the impact of the recognition and initial measurement of fin on our financial position and results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas no 
also requires that disclosures of the pro forma effect of using the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation be displayed more prominently and in a tabular format 
additionally  sfas no 
requires disclosure of the pro forma effect in interim financial statements 
the transition and annual disclosure requirements of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years ending after december  and have been adopted by us 
we have elected to continue to account for employee stock options under accounting principles board opinion apb no 
the disclosure only provisions of sfas no

the interim disclosure requirements are effective for interim periods commencing after december  the adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in january  the fasb issued fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin is effective immediately for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  we are currently in the process of evaluating the impact that the adoption of this standard will have on our financial position and results of operations 
factors that may affect future results in addition to other information in this report  the following factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the company 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the company 
additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or currently deem immaterial may also become important factors that may harm our business 

table of contents our quarterly operating results may fluctuate in future periods  and  as a result  our stock price may fluctuate or decline 
our operating results have fluctuated from quarter to quarter during the past three fiscal years 
we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our historical results of operations are not indicative of our future performance 
our revenues and operating results may continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  including the factors discussed below under the captions our operating results would be harmed if the information technology and database industries continue in a downward trend  if we are not able to enhance our existing products to adapt to rapid technological change  or we introduce new products that do not achieve market acceptance  our revenues and earnings may suffer and we may experience loss of market share  large sales of our products and maintenance involve a lengthy sales cycle  which could cause delays in recognizing revenue or the failure to obtain revenue  our high fixed operating expenses might adversely affect our profitability if future revenue expectations are not met  we may have future non recurring charges in the event of goodwill impairment  we may be required to change our revenue recognition policies based on changing implementation guidelines and interpretations  which could cause our revenues and operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly  if our products do not perform as expected  we may lose customer  our costs will increase and revenues may be delayed or lost  and acquisitions of companies or technologies may result in disruptions to our business 
seasonal variations in orders for our products also contribute to fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
these fluctuations are likely to cause corresponding volatility in our stock price  particularly if our operating results vary from analysts expectations 
if sales of dbartisan fall  our revenues and income may decline 
a large portion of our revenues currently comes from sales of our dbartisan product 
for the years ended december   and  dbartisan accounted for approximately   and  respectively  of our domestic license revenues 
we expect that sales of dbartisan will continue to represent a substantial portion of our license revenues for the foreseeable future 
in addition  many of our customers initiate a relationship with us by purchasing dbartisan 
if demand for dbartisan declines due to competition  technological change or other factors  our revenues and income may decline significantly 
if we do not add new customers and generate new business from our existing customers  we will not be able to sustain or increase our revenues 
our license arrangements generally do not provide for substantial ongoing license or maintenance payments 
therefore  our future revenue growth depends on our success in attracting new customers and expanding our relationships with existing customers 
our ability to attract new customers and expand our relationships with existing customers will depend on a variety of factors  including the performance  quality  breadth and depth of our current and future products and maintenance 
our failure to add new customers or to expand our relationships with existing customers would reduce our future license and maintenance revenues 
in addition  if our existing customers do not renew their support contracts  our future maintenance revenues will be adversely affected 
our operating results would be harmed if the information technology and database industries continue in a downward trend 
the markets into which we sell our products are cyclical and are subject to general economic conditions 
the information technology and database industries have experienced a downturn due to declines in general economic conditions 
we believe that the current economic downturn has had an impact on capital spending for database technology and related products 
we are uncertain as to how long and how deep the current downturn may be in the database market 
any continued or further slowdowns in the database market or in general economic conditions would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and would harm our business 
we invest heavily in research and development with no guarantee of return from the investments that we make 
we have invested significant resources in the development of new products 
if our new products are not accepted in the marketplace  we could suffer a 
table of contents contraction of revenue growth and have limited return on the investments that we have made 
in addition  we plan to continue to invest in research and development and could suffer the same effects from these future investments 
if we are not able to enhance our existing products to adapt to rapid technological change  or we introduce new products that do not achieve market acceptance  our revenues and earnings may suffer and we may experience loss of market share 
the market for our products is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent product introductions and enhancements  uncertain product life cycles and changes in customer demands and industry standards 
our success depends on our ability to continue to enhance our current products  introduce new products that keep pace with technological developments  satisfy increasingly complicated customer requirements  integrate our products with multiple database platforms  and modify our products as database platforms change 
however  due to the nature of computing environments  new products and product enhancements could require longer development and testing periods than we currently anticipate 
the economic downturn has also made it more difficult for new products to gain acceptance in the market 
moreover  if we develop new products that do not achieve market acceptance  we may not be able to recoup development and marketing expenses  which could harm our operating results 
the introduction of new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards may render our existing products obsolete and unmarketable 
delays in the general availability of new releases or problems in the installation or implementation of new releases could harm our business and operating results 
we may not be successful in developing and marketing  on a timely and cost effective basis  new products or new product enhancements that respond to technological change  evolving industry standards or customer requirements 
our failure to do so would render our products obsolete and could harm our ability to compete 
in addition  our products and product enhancements may not achieve market acceptance 
large sales of our products and maintenance involve a lengthy sales cycle  which could cause delays in recognizing revenue or the failure to obtain revenue 
since  large sales of our products and maintenance to individual customers have increased 
this is due to our sales efforts to sell larger deals of our traditional software as well as the introduction of new products that having significantly higher starting prices and longer evaluation periods than our traditional products 
these large sales typically involve sales cycles between and months  which is considerably longer than our historical sales cycle 
this lengthy sales cycle is due to the need to educate and to convince prospective customers of the value of our products and to gain approval from a more constituencies within a prospective customer  including key management personnel 
the timing of our revenues has become more difficult to forecast because of this lengthy sales cycle for large sales 
we may expend substantial time and resources to negotiate transactions with prospective customers but then be delayed in concluding  or be unable to conclude  sales of our products and maintenance 
any delay in  or failure to complete  sales in a particular period would reduce our revenues in that period as well as in subsequent periods over which revenues for the sale may be recognized 
if we were to experience a delay on one or more large orders  it could harm our ability to meet our forecasts for a given period 
if our sales cycle unexpectedly lengthens in general or for one or more large sales  it could negatively affect the timing of our revenues and our revenue growth and may cause our revenues and operating results to vary significantly from period to period 
our high fixed operating expenses might adversely affect our profitability if future revenue expectations are not met 
the majority of our operating expenses consists of personnel and related expenses and facilities related costs 
these costs are relatively fixed in the short term  and our operating decisions  such as when to hire additional personnel and when to expand our facilities and infrastructure  are based in large part on expectations about expected future revenues 
if we hire personnel and enter into facilities contracts based on our expectations about future revenues  and then we fail to meet these revenue expectations  we would likely have lower than expected earnings per share  which would negatively affect our stock price 

table of contents we may have future non recurring charges in the event of goodwill impairment 
we adopted sfas no 
on january  and  as a result  we have ceased amortization of goodwill 
going forward  we will be required to test our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or in the event of a significant change in our business 
we performed impairment tests in january and september and determined that  at those times  there had been no impairment in goodwill 
at december  our goodwill balance totaled million 
in the future  if we determine that this goodwill has been impaired  we will be required to take a non recurring charge to write down this asset  which would adversely affect our earnings and book value 
we may be required to change our revenue recognition policies based on changing implementation guidelines and interpretations  which may cause our revenues and operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly 
in recent years  software revenue recognition rules have been under heavy review and interpretation by various accounting authoritative and regulatory bodies  including the american institute for certified public accountants and the financial accounting standards board 
these reviews and interpretations have resulted in significant changes in the practices and standards for recognizing revenues in software companies 
there could be further changes in these standards 
we may have to change our methods of revenue recognition to comply with new standards  and any such change could cause deferment of revenues recognized in current periods to subsequent periods or accelerated recognition of deferred revenue to current periods  either of which could cause shortfalls in meeting securities analysts and investors expectations in any period 
any such shortfalls could have an adverse impact on our stock price 
the expansion of our international operations exposes us to risks 
we expect to continue to expand our international sales and research and development operations 
as a result  we could face a number of risks from our expanding international operations  including staffing and managing foreign operations  increased financial accounting and reporting complexities  potentially adverse tax consequences  the loss of revenues and net income resulting from currency fluctuations  compliance with a wide variety of complex foreign laws and treaties  the impact of war or terrorist activities  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  licenses  tariffs and other trade barriers  longer sales and payment cycles  and costs and difficulties of customizing products for foreign countries 
further expansion of our international operations may require significant management attention and financial resources and may place burdens on our management  administrative  operational and financial infrastructure 
our possible investments in establishing facilities in other countries may not produce desired levels of revenues or profitability 
if our products do not perform as expected  we may lose customers  our costs will increase and revenues may be delayed or lost 
computer software such as ours often contains undetected errors and may contain design flaws 
errors may be found in current versions  new versions or enhancements of our products after we make commercial shipments 
if our software contains undetected errors  performs unreliably  or if we otherwise fail to meet our customers expectations  we may suffer loss of revenues  market share or customers  negative publicity and harm to our reputation  diversion of research and development and management resources  increased maintenance and warranty costs  legal actions by customers against us  and increased insurance costs 
we may lose market share and be required to reduce prices as a result of competition from our existing competitors and other independent software vendors and developers of software 
the market for our products is highly competitive  dynamic and subject to rapidly changing technology 
pricing pressure in the market has increased as competitors have lowered prices and engaged in more aggressive discounting 
if such pricing pressure continues  it could have an adverse effect on our margins 
we compete primarily against other providers of application design  database management and data 
table of contents movement software solutions  which include computer associates  quest software  bmc software  ibm rational software  borland software corporation  informatica corporation  ascential software and other independent software vendors 
our products also compete with products offered by database software manufacturers  including oracle  microsoft  sybase and ibm 
some of these competing products are provided at no charge to their customers 
we expect that companies such as oracle  microsoft  sybase and ibm will continue to develop and incorporate into their products applications which compete with our products and may take advantage of their substantial technical  financial  marketing and distribution resources in those efforts 
we may not be able to compete effectively with those products or efforts  which could significantly harm our business and operating results 
over the past year  there has been increasing consolidation in our industry 
recent acquisitions may have the effect of improving the competitive positions of the acquired companies and weakening our competitive situation 
to effectively compete as the industry consolidates  we may need to seek alliances with other companies in order to better gain acceptance of our products 
we may not be able to enter into such alliances on terms favorable to us or at all 
in addition  if the market for application design and database management products grows  some of our competitors may increase their focus on offering software directly competitive with ours  whether by internal development  external development or acquisition 
our competitors may also attempt to keep us from integrating our software with theirs  making it more difficult for our customers to adopt our software 
if such increased competition were to result in resistance to integration of our software with the software of these competitors  our business would be harmed 
further  if a single database platform were to gain a considerably larger share of the database market than other database platforms  we would lose our multi platform competitive advantage and our sales would suffer 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories  substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  and greater name recognition than we do 
they also may be able to respond more quickly than we can to changes in technology or customer requirements 
competition could seriously impede our ability to sell additional products on acceptable terms 
our competitors may develop and market new technologies that render our products obsolete  unmarketable or otherwise less competitive  make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with other companies  thereby enhancing the functionality of their products  or establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with channel or strategic partners which limit our ability to sell or to co market products through these channels 
competitive pressures could reduce our market share  reduce customer orders  reduce gross margins or require us to reduce our prices  any of which would harm our operating results 
acquisitions of companies or technologies may result in disruptions to our business 
we may make strategic acquisitions of companies  products or technologies as necessary in order to implement our business strategy 
if we make acquisitions and are unable to successfully integrate them with our existing operations  we may not receive the intended benefits of such acquisitions and the revenues and operating results of the combined company may decline 
any acquisition may temporarily disrupt our operations and divert management s attention from day to day operations 
in addition  acquisitions may subject us to unanticipated liabilities or risks 
while we have financed our acquisitions to date primarily with working capital  we may incur debt or issue equity securities to finance future acquisitions 
the issuance of equity securities for any acquisition could be substantially dilutive to our stockholders 
in addition  our profitability may suffer due to acquisition related expenses 
international political instability may increase our cost of doing business and disrupt our business 
increased international political instability  evidenced by the threat or occurrence of terrorist attacks  the war in iraq  enhanced national security measures  sustained military action in afghanistan  strained international relations with north korea and other conflicts in the middle east and asia  may halt or hinder our ability to do business  may increase our costs and may adversely affect our stock price 
this increased 
table of contents instability may  for example  negatively impact the reliability and cost of transportation  negatively affect the desire of our employees and customers to travel  adversely affect our ability to obtain adequate insurance at reasonable rates or require us to take extra security precautions for our domestic and international operations 
in addition  this international political instability has had and may continue to have negative effects on financial markets  including significant price and volume fluctuations in securities markets 
if this international political instability continues or escalates  our business and results of operations could be harmed and the market price of our common stock could decline 
our proprietary rights may be inadequately protected and infringement claims or independent development of competing technologies could harm our competitive position 
we rely on copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
we also enter into confidentiality agreements with employees and consultants and attempt to restrict access to proprietary information on a need to know basis 
despite such precautions  unauthorized third parties may be able to copy aspects of our products or obtain and use information that we consider as proprietary 
we license our software products primarily under shrink wrap licenses included as part of product packaging 
shrink wrap licenses are not negotiated with or signed by individual licensees and purport to take effect upon the opening of the product package or downloading of the product from the internet 
these measures afford only limited protection 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult and we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software exists 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights as well as united states laws 
we may have to enter into litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others with respect to our rights 
litigation is generally very expensive and can divert the attention of management from daily operations 
accordingly  any intellectual property litigation could disrupt our operations and harm our operating results 
we are not aware of any case in which we are infringing the proprietary rights of others 
however  third parties may bring infringement claims against us 
any such claim is likely to be time consuming and costly to defend  could cause product delays and could force us to enter into unfavorable royalty or license agreements with third parties 
a successful infringement claim against us could require us to enter into a license or royalty agreement with the claimant or develop alternative technology 
however  we may not be able to negotiate favorable license or royalty agreements  if any  in connection with such claims and we may fail to develop alternative technology on a timely basis 
accordingly  a successful product infringement claim against us could harm our business and operating results 
if we are not able to attract and retain qualified personnel  our business will not be able to grow 
our success depends on the continued service of our executive officers and other key administrative  sales and marketing  research and development and support personnel 
none of our executive officers or key employees is bound by an employment agreement for any specific term and we do not maintain any key person life insurance policies 
if we lose the services of one or more of our executive officers or key employees  or if one or more of them decide to join a competitor or otherwise compete directly or indirectly with us  our business could be seriously harmed 
our business will not be able to grow if we cannot attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
despite the economic downturn  competition for qualified employees remains intense and we may not be able to attract  assimilate or retain highly qualified personnel in the future 
there has in the past been and there may in the future be a shortage of personnel that possess the technical background necessary to sell  support and develop our products effectively 
some of our current employees and those that we seek to hire may be subject to non competition or non solicitation covenants that could further limit our ability to attract or retain qualified personnel 
we are susceptible to business interruptions that could harm our business 
our operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from computer viruses  human error  natural disasters  telecommunications failures  intentional acts of vandalism and similar events 
in particular  our corporate headquarters are located in san francisco  which is known for seismic activity 

table of contents although we have a disaster recovery plan for critical data and business applications  this does not provide assurance that we would not suffer a business interruption 
a significant business interruption would result in losses or damages incurred by us and would harm our business 
our business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for losses that might occur 
certain insiders have substantial control over us  which could impede stockholder approval of certain transactions 
our executive officers and directors  in the aggregate  beneficially held of our outstanding common stock as of december  these stockholders  if acting together  can influence significantly all matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions 
we expect the price of our common stock to remain volatile  making it difficult for our stockholders to predict the return on their investment 
since our initial public offering  the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in response to a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control  including changes in market valuation of software and internet companies  quarterly variations in our operating results  global and domestic economic and political conditions  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  announcements that we or our competitors make related to significant contracts  acquisitions  capital commitments  strategic partnerships or product introductions or enhancements  additions or departures of key personnel  stock market price and volume fluctuations  which are particularly volatile among securities of software and internet companies  and sales of significant amounts of our common stock or other securities in the open market 
the market for technology and internet related companies has experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
provisions of our charter and bylaws and delaware law could deter takeover attempts that might be beneficial to our stockholders 
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
we are subject to the provisions of delaware law  which restrict business combinations with interested stockholders  which may have the effect of inhibiting a non negotiated merger or other business combinations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates primarily relates to our investment portfolio  which at december  included fixed income securities with a fair value of approximately million 
the values of these securities are likely to decline if interest rates increase 
however  due to the short maturities of our investments  an immediate percent change in interest rates is not expected to have a material effect on our near term financial condition or results of operations 
foreign exchange risk our operations are conducted primarily in the united states and are denominated in united states dollars 
a small but growing portion of our sales originate through our european subsidiary and are denominated in pounds sterling 
from time to time  we enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge against fluctuations in the pounds sterling relative to the united states dollar 
gains and losses on these contracts are generally recognized in the consolidated statement of operations at the time that the related transactions being hedged are recognized 
because the effect of movements in currency exchange rates on forward exchange contracts generally offset the related effect on the underlying items being hedged  use of these instruments is not expected to subject us to risks that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we recorded losses from derivatives of  and  in and  respectively  which were recorded as other income  net in our statement of operations 
we did not use derivative financial instruments in
