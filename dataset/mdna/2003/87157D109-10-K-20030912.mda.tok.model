item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements and factors that may affect results you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors  including those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a leading worldwide developer and supplier of custom designed user interface solutions that enable people to interact more easily and intuitively with a wide variety of mobile computing and communications devices 
from our inception in through  we were a development stage company  which focused on developing and refining our pattern recognition and capacitive sensing technologies  and generated revenue by providing contract engineering and design services 
in fiscal  we began shipping our proprietary touchpad and are now the world s leading supplier of interface solutions to the notebook computer market 
we estimate our market share to be approximately for all notebook computer interfaces for fiscal we believe our market share results from the combination of our customer focus  the strength of our intellectual property  and our engineering know how  which allow us to design products that meet the demanding design specifications of oems 
in april  we began shipping our initial dual pointing solution  which included third party products  that enables notebook oems to offer end users the combination of both a touch pad and a pointing stick 
in january  we achieved our first design win incorporating our proprietary pointing stick solution  touchstyk  into a dual pointing application for use in a notebook computer and began shipping them in volume in the december quarter 
with the introduction of our touchstyk  we now offer oems the choice of a touch pad  a pointing stick  or a combination of both of our proprietary interface solutions for dual pointing applications 
we have experienced significant demand for our dual pointing solutions  which results in higher revenue because we are able to sell two interface solutions for each notebook computer 
our initial dual pointing solutions contained a significant percentage of third party products  which we either resell or license 
as a consequence  the gross margin on our dual pointing revenue was initially well below the gross margin we experience from the sale of our proprietary interface solutions and had a significant negative impact on our gross margin in fiscal the combination of the full implementation of our cost improvement programs for our dual pointing solutions containing key third party products  which began in the second half of fiscal  together with our new proprietary dual pointing solutions  which began shipping in december  improved our gross margin in fiscal compared to our gross margin in fiscal we recognize revenue upon shipment of our products and when title and risk of loss has passed to our customers 
our revenue increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  a compound annual growth rate of approximately 
through fiscal  we derived all of our product revenue from the notebook computer market 
we began to generate revenue from other markets in fiscal  and in fiscal  revenue from other markets grew to approximately of our revenue 
while we have been awarded design wins by many of the japanese oems of notebook computers  which are currently ordering and receiving products from us  our largest customers are the major us based oems that sell notebook computers worldwide 
adverse conditions in the notebook computer market or a competitive shift from us to japanese oems could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  and prospects 
we work closely with our customers to design interface solutions to meet their specific requirements and provide both pre sale custom design services and post sale support 
during the design phase  we typically do not have any commitment from our customers to pay for our non recurring engineering costs should the customer decide not to introduce that specific product or choose not to incorporate our interface solution in its products 
we believe our focus on customer service and support has allowed us to develop strong customer relationships in the pc market  which we plan to expand in the future  and has provided us with the experience necessary to develop strong customer relationships in the new markets we intend to penetrate 

table of contents in june we acquired nsm technology limited nsm  a hong kong company 
the acquisition of nsm provides us with a highly skilled and experienced work force to expand our global presence and infrastructure to support customers in the asia pacific region 
many of our customers are migrating their manufacturing operations from taiwan to china  and our oem customers are beginning to set up design centers in that region 
with our expanded global presence  where we now have offices in taiwan and hong kong  we are better positioned to provide local sales  operations  and engineering support services to our existing customers  as well as potential new customers  within the asia pacific region 
our manufacturing operations are based on a variable cost model in which we outsource all of our production requirements  eliminating the need for significant capital expenditures and allowing us to minimize our investment in inventories 
this approach requires us to work closely with our manufacturing subcontractors to ensure adequate production capacity to meet our forecasted volume requirements 
we provide our manufacturing subcontractors with six month rolling forecasts and issue purchase orders based on our anticipated requirements for the next days 
we do not have any long term supply contracts with any of our manufacturing subcontractors 
currently  we primarily use one third party manufacturer to provide our proprietary capacitive based asics  and in certain cases  we also rely on a single source or a limited number of suppliers to provide other key components of our products 
our cost of sales includes all costs associated with the production of our products  including materials  manufacturing  and assembly costs paid to third party manufacturers and related overhead costs associated with our manufacturing operations personnel 
additionally  all warranty costs and any inventory provisions or write downs are expensed as cost of sales 
our gross margin generally reflects the combination of the added value we bring to our customers products in meeting their custom design requirements and our ongoing cost improvement programs 
in fiscal  we experienced significant pressure on our gross margin  resulting from the increasing revenue mix of dual pointing solutions containing significant third party products 
we have been successful in implementing cost reductions that have significantly improved the gross margins of these dual pointing solutions 
these cost improvement programs include reducing component costs and implementing design and process improvements 
in addition  our gross margin has been positively impacted by shipments of our proprietary dual pointing solutions  which began shipping in volume in our december quarter 
in the future  we plan to introduce additional new products  which may initially negatively impact our gross margin  as was the case with our dual pointing solutions 
our research and development expenses include expenses related to product development  engineering  materials costs  patent expenses  and the costs incurred to design interface solutions for customers prior to the customers commitment to incorporate those solutions into their products 
these expenses have generally increased  reflecting our continuing commitment to the technological and design innovation required to maintain a leadership position in our existing markets and to develop new technologies for new markets 
in fiscal  we significantly increased our research and development expenses as a result of our october acquisition of absolute sensors limited  or asl  a company located in cambridge  united kingdom  which has been developing inductive pensensing technology applicable to new markets we intend to address 
also related to this acquisition was the write off in fiscal of acquired in process research and development of  and the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets of approximately  the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets related to this acquisition totaled  in fiscal as the result of the july  adoption of statement of financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets fas  we ceased amortization of goodwill and accordingly only recorded amortization of other intangible assets of  and  in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
as of june   the other intangible assets were fully amortized and the carrying value of the remaining goodwill will be reviewed at least annually for impairment 
selling  general  and administrative expenses include expenses related to sales  marketing  and administrative personnel  internal sales and outside sales representatives commissions  market research and consulting  and other marketing and sales activities 
these expenses have generally increased  reflecting increased staffing  commission expense associated with higher revenue levels  and additional management personnel in anticipation of our continued growth in our existing markets and penetration into new markets 
in october  we began replacing outside sales representatives with inside sales personnel for certain customer accounts to facilitate a closer working relationship with those customers 
we continue to utilize both inside sales personnel and outside sales representatives and agents 
in fiscal and  we recorded amortization of goodwill and other intangible 
table of contents assets related to the june acquisition of the employees of a former taiwanese sales agent of  and  respectively 
these assets were fully amortized as of june  in connection with the grant of stock options to our employees  we recorded deferred stock compensation of approximately million through fiscal  representing the difference between the deemed fair value of our common stock for financial reporting purposes and the exercise price of these options at the date of grant 
deferred stock compensation is presented as a reduction of stockholders equity and is amortized on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
options granted are typically subject to a four year vesting period 
restricted stock acquired through the exercise of unvested stock options is subject to our right to repurchase the unvested stock at the price paid  which right to repurchase lapses over the vesting period 
we also recorded million of deferred compensation related to options granted to consultants through fiscal we are amortizing the deferred stock compensation over the vesting periods of the applicable options and the repurchase periods for the restricted stock 
we recorded amortization of deferred stock compensation of approximately   and  in fiscal   and  respectively 
we will incur stock compensation expense in future periods as a result of the amortization of the remaining million of deferred stock compensation relating to previously granted stock options 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory  warranty  income taxes  intangible assets  and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and title has transferred  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we accrue for estimated sales returns and other allowances at the time we recognize revenue  which is typically upon shipment  based on historical experience 
contract revenue for research and development is recorded as earned based on the performance requirements of the contract 
non refundable contract fees for which no further performance obligations exist  and for which there is no continuing involvement by us  are recognized on the earlier of when the payments are received or when collection is assured 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to meet their financial obligations 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances in which we are aware of a specific customer s potential inability to meet its financial obligation  we record a specific reserve of the bad debt against amounts due 
in addition  we must make judgments and estimates of the collectibility of accounts receivables based on historical bad debt  customers credit worthiness  current economic trends  recent changes in customer payment trends  and deterioration in the customers operating results or financial position 
if circumstances change adversely  additional allowances may be required 
inventory we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
our assessment of the ultimate realization of inventories is based on our projections of future demand and market conditions 
any sudden decline in demand  rapid product improvements  or technological changes  or any of them  can cause us to have excess or obsolete inventories 
on an ongoing basis  we review for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventories and write down our 
table of contents inventories to their net realizable value based upon our forecasts of future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than our forecasts  additional inventory reserves may be required 
our estimates are influenced by the following considerations sudden decline in demand due to economic downturn  rapid product improvements and technological changes  and termination by our oem customers of any product offerings incorporating our product solutions 
warranty we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  materials usage  and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
we exercise judgment in determining the estimates underlying our accrued warranty liability 
the actual results with regard to warranty expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our operating results if the actual rate of unit failure is greater than what we used in estimating the accrued warranty liability 
income taxes we recognize federal  state  and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction 
we also recognize federal  state  and foreign deferred tax liabilities or assets for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryfowards and record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that  based on available evidence and judgment  are not expected to be realized 
if our assumptions and consequently our estimates change in the future  the valuation allowance we have established for our deferred tax assets may be increased  which could result in increased income tax expense 
results of operations the following table presents our historical operating results for the periods indicated as a percentage of revenue 
years ended june  net revenue cost of revenue gross margin operating expenses research and development selling  general  and administrative amortization of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets amortization of deferred stock compensation total operating expenses operating income interest income interest expense income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  net revenue 
revenue for the year ended june  was million  which was essentially flat with the million of revenue for the year ended june  unit shipments increased approximately year over year but were mostly offset by a change in product mix from dual to single pointing solutions  general competitive pricing pressure  and lower non recurring engineering and patent license fees 
while we experienced increases in revenue from our single pointing products and non pc products  revenue from dual pointing products declined 
revenue from our dual pointing applications was approximately of our revenue for the year 
table of contents ended june  compared to for the year ended june  revenue growth was impacted by lower overall average selling prices resulting from both the mix change and competitive pricing pressure 
gross margin 
gross margin as a percentage of revenue was for the year ended june  compared to for the year ended june  the improvement in gross margin as a percentage of revenue resulted primarily from cost reductions  and changes in product mix  partially offset by general competitive pricing pressures 
during fiscal our ongoing cost improvement programs resulted in manufacturing efficiencies gained from design and process improvements and lower materials and assembly costs 
increased sales of our proprietary dual pointing solutions  which have higher gross margin than dual pointing solutions using third party products  also contributed to the improvement in gross margin as a percentage of sales 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million  or of revenue  for the year ended june  from million  or of revenue  for the year ended june  the major contributors to the increased spending were costs associated with our higher staffing levels  including compensation and facilities related costs  higher product development activities  which included outside services  and material costs 
selling  general  and administrative expenses 
selling  general  and administrative expenses for the year ended june  increased to million  or of revenue  from million  or of revenue  for the year ended june  the increase in spending resulted mainly from higher compensation costs associated with increased staffing levels  generally higher operating levels  and additional costs related to our status as a public reporting company  partially offset by lower commissions  primarily resulting from the replacement of outside sales representatives with inside sales personnel for certain customer accounts that we implemented in october amortization of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets 
amortization of other intangible assets was related to our october acquisition of asl  a company located in cambridge  united kingdom 
for the year ended june   we recorded amortization of  compared to  for the year ended june  as of june   these other intangible assets were fully amortized 
amortization of deferred stock compensation 
the year ended june  included amortization expense for deferred stock compensation of  compared to  for the year ended june  we expect to record amortization expense of  in fiscal with the remaining balance of  to be amortized through fiscal operating income 
we generated operating income of million for the year ended june  compared to million for the year ended june  the major contributors to the lower operating income were the increase in operating expenses  which primarily resulted from higher costs associated with our increased staffing levels  including higher compensation and facilities related costs  higher research and development expenses related to increased product development activities  and additional costs related to our status as a public reporting company 
the increase in operating expenses were partially offset by the improvement in gross margin percentage  which resulted from lower manufacturing costs related to improved manufacturing efficiencies from our ongoing design and process improvement programs and lower material costs  a favorable product mix within our dual pointing product line  lower sales commissions  and slightly higher revenue 
net interest income 
net interest income was  for the year ended june  compared to  for the year ended june  the increase in net interest income reflects higher interest income from higher cash balances resulting primarily from the investment our initial public offering proceeds  cash flow from operations  and lower interest expense associated with equipment lease financing arrangements  partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates on invested cash 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended june  was million compared to million for the year ended june   reflecting the lower pre tax profit levels  partially offset by a slightly higher tax rate 
the income tax provision represents the estimated federal and state taxes and the foreign taxes associated with our operations in the united kingdom  taiwan  and japan 
the effective tax rate for the year ended june  was approximately  which is lower than the combined federal and state statutory rate primarily due to the benefit of research and development tax credits 

table of contents fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  net revenue 
revenue for the year ended june  was million compared to million for the year june   a increase 
the increase in revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in unit shipments  higher revenue content per notebook from dual pointing solutions that include both a touch pad and a pointing stick  and non recurring engineering and patent license fees of million  partially offset by general competitive pricing pressure 
revenue from our dual pointing solutions represented approximately of our revenue for the year ended june  compared to for the year ended june  gross margin 
gross margin as a percentage of revenue was for the year ended june  compared to for the year ended june  the improvement in gross margin as a percentage of revenue resulted from the implementation of cost improvement programs  which reduced the cost of our dual pointing solutions through the combination of design and process improvements  lower outside assembly costs  generally lower costs for materials and electronic components  the introduction of our proprietary dual pointing solutions  and non recurring engineering and patent license revenue in the amount of million  partially offset by general competitive pricing pressure 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million  or of revenue  for the year ended june  from million  or of revenue  for the year ended june  the major contributors to the increase in spending were higher compensation costs associated with increased staffing levels and higher product development related expenses  including outside services and materials costs 
selling  general  and administrative expenses 
selling  general  and administrative expenses for the year ended june  increased to million  or of revenue  from million  or of revenue  for the year ended june  the increase in actual spending resulted from increased staffing  including additions to our inside sales force  increased expenses related to our higher operating levels  and costs incurred related to our filings with the securities and exchange commission in connection with amendments to our initial public offering and periodic and quarterly filings  partially offset by lower sales commissions resulting from the replacement of outside sales representatives with inside sales personnel for certain customer accounts beginning in october amortization of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets 
the year ended june  reflected charges of  for the amortization of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets related to acquisitions 
in connection with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets on july   amortization of goodwill was terminated  which resulted in significantly lower amortization charges in the year ended june  compared to the year ended june  amortization of other intangible assets continued in accordance with the previously determined useful economic lives  which resulted in total amortization charges of  in the year ended june  we assess the potential impairment of goodwill annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
amortization of deferred stock compensation 
the year ended june  includes amortization expense for deferred stock compensation of  compared to  for the year ended june  operating income 
we generated operating income of million for the year ended june  compared to  for the year ended june  the major contributors to the improvement in operating income included the increased revenue levels  the higher gross margin percentage resulting from the implementation of our cost improvement programs for our dual pointing solutions  lower assembly costs  lower materials and electronic components costs  non recurring engineering and patent license revenue  lower sales commissions related to the replacement of outside sales representatives with inside direct sales personnel  and lower amortization expense for goodwill and other acquired intangible assets 
these factors were partially offset by higher compensation costs  resulting from our increased staffing levels  higher research and development project costs  and costs incurred related to our filings with the securities and exchange commission in connection with amendments to our initial public offering and periodic and quarterly filings 
net interest income 
net interest income was  for the year ended june  compared to  for the year ended june  the increase in net interest income primarily reflects the investment of 
table of contents the proceeds from our initial public offering  which closed on february   partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates on invested cash and higher interest expense associated with equipment lease financing arrangements 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes for the year ended june  was million compared to  for the year ended june   reflecting the higher pre tax profit levels 
the income tax provision represents the estimated federal and state taxes and the foreign taxes associated with our operations in the united kingdom and taiwan 
the effective tax rate for the year ended june  was approximately  reflecting the benefit of research and development tax credits and a reduction in the valuation allowance  partially offset by nondeductible deferred compensation 
the effective tax rate for the year ended june  was and was lower than the statutory rate of  primarily due to the benefits of utilizing net operating loss carryforwards  which were fully utilized during fiscal  and research and development tax credits 
tax benefits for fiscal were partially offset by nondeductible deferred compensation and goodwill amortization

we do not anticipate making any payments under the limited recourse loan with national semiconductor  either prior to or at maturity  unless foveon is participating in a liquidity event  such as an initial public offering of its equity securities or a merger  through which we would be able to receive amounts in excess of our million long term note payable plus accrued interest expense 

table of contents we believe our existing cash balances will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements at least through the next months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our rate of revenue growth  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts  the expansion of sales and marketing activities  the timing of introductions of new products and enhancements to existing products  the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity  the continuing market acceptance of our product solutions  and the amount and timing of our investments in  or acquisition of  other technologies or companies 
we cannot assure you that additional equity or debt financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all

recent accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation requires that if a business enterprise has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity  the assets  liabilities  and results of activities of the variable interest entity should be included in the consolidated financial statements of the business enterprise 
this interpretation is effective immediately for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of this interpretation must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  we currently do not have any financial interest in variable interest entities 
the adoption of this interpretation did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
effective prospectively for arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june   emerging issues task force eitf issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  addresses the accounting by a vendor for contractual arrangements in which multiple revenue generating activities will be performed by the vendor 
in some situations  the different revenue generating activities deliverables are sufficiently separable and there exists sufficient evidence of fair values to account separately for the different deliverables that is  there are separate units of accounting 
in other situations  some or all of the different deliverables are interrelated closely or there is not sufficient evidence of fair value to account separately for the different deliverables 
eitf issue addresses when and  if so  how an arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting 
the adoption of this interpretation is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise shall be effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
due to the conservative nature of our investment portfolio  which is predicated on capital preservation and consists primarily of government backed securities and investment grade instruments  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be significantly affected by changes in market interest rates 
we do not use our investment portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes 
the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio and debt obligations as of june  in thousands fair fiscal year ended june  thereafter total value assets cash equivalents variable rate amounts average rate short term investments variable rate amounts average rate liabilities capital leases and equipment financing obligations fixed rate amounts average rate note payable to related party fixed rate amounts average rate there have been no significant changes in the maturity dates and average interest rates for our investment portfolio and debt obligations subsequent to june  foreign currency exchange risk all of our sales and our expenses  except those expenses related to our uk and taiwan operations  are denominated in uk dollars 
as a result  we have relatively little exposure to foreign currency exchange risks and foreign exchange losses have been immaterial to date 
we do not currently enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposure denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
in the future  if we feel that our foreign exchange exposure has increased  we may consider entering into hedging transactions to help mitigate that risk
