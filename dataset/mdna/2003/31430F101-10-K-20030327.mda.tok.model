item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
these non strategic hotels have an average of rooms  while the average number of rooms for the remainder of our portfolio is the industry the continued stagnation of the us and global economies  the negative wealth effect from the sharp decline in stock values  the erosion of consumer confidence  the difficulties associated with air travel and the prospect of war in iraq  combined to adversely affect lodging demand 
the unprecedented decline in lodging demand is evidenced by the decline in industry revenue per available room  or revpar  for and  the first two year consecutive decline since industry revpar has been tracked 
after months of consecutive industry revpar declines  the industry recorded increased revpar for the last four months of the revpar increases for the last four months of were driven by occupancy increases over the same period in the prior year 
in addition to weak demand  adr has declined because of competitive pressures and discounting of room rates through the internet 
business travel is a key profit driver in the lodging industry 
in a ubs warburg survey conducted in october  corporate travel managers reported that they anticipate hotel spending and negotiated rates will be slightly lower than in and approximately of their spending is projected to be in downtown urban markets 
these corporate travel managers indicated that they plan to direct less business to luxury hotels  and more to midscale and upscale hotels 
one of the most positive fundamentals for the lodging industry is that supply growth has been sharply curtailed 
according to pricewaterhousecoopers hospitality directions us edition december forecast update  room supply rose only and in and  respectively  and is projected to increase only in each of and this level of growth is the lowest since  and is well below the historical year average of per annum 
we do not anticipate a significant recovery in lodging industry revpar during although most economists are forecasting gdp growth in  growth in lodging demand has historically lagged the general economy by six to months 
increasing business travel is typically foreshadowed by growth in both corporate profits and employment 
companies tend to wait for growth in profits prior to hiring  and hire prior to releasing funds for travel 
the recovery to date has been termed the jobless recovery 
as such  we do not anticipate that corporations will increase their travel budgets until there is more clarity with regard to the economy and corporate profits 
additionally  lodging demand will be adversely affected during by the continued fear of an event of terrorism  the commencement of war with iraq and the increased inconvenience encountered during air travel due to heightened security 
smith travel research  a leading provider of industry data  classifies hotel chains into five distinct categories upper upscale  upscale  midscale with food beverage  midscale without food beverage  and economy 
we own properties in the upper upscale including doubletree guest suites  doubletree  embassy suites hotels  sheraton and westin hotels  upscale including crowne plaza and homewood suites  and midscale with food beverage including holiday inn and holiday inn select hotels categories  from which we derived approximately of our ebitda in more than of our ebitda in was derived from upper upscale all suite hotels 
smith travel research also categorizes hotels based upon their relative market positions  as measured by average daily rate  or adr  as luxury  upscale  midprice  economy and budget 
the following table contains information with respect to average occupancy determined by dividing occupied rooms by available rooms  adr and revpar for our hotels  as well as all upscale us hotels  all midprice us hotels and all us hotels  as reported by smith travel research  for the periods indicated

this category includes hotels in the upscale price level  defined as hotels with adrs in the th to th percentiles in their respective markets 
this category includes hotels in the midscale level  defined as hotels with adrs in the th to th percentiles in their respective markets 
business strategy in the current operating environment  in which the lodging industry has experienced declines in revpar for two consecutive years  we intend to continue focusing on preserving capital  maximizing operating cash flow by actively overseeing the operation of our hotels by our managers  maintaining financial flexibility and placing ourselves in the best position possible to take advantage of opportunities that may arise in the future 
we have established  and intend to maintain  strong strategic relationships with our brand owners and managers and have successfully demonstrated our ability to apply our asset management expertise to the renovation  redevelopment and rebranding of our hotels 
maintenance of financial flexibility during the current challenging economic environment  we have committed ourselves to conserving capital  maximizing operating cash flow from our hotels and maintaining financial flexibility to take advantage of opportunities that may arise in the future 
we expect our board of directors to suspend our common dividends until our hotels experience an increase in revpar of to  decisions on future distributions on common and preferred stock will be made based on hotel operating results and minimum distributions required to maintain reit status 
we intend to limit distributions generally to not more than available cash flow  after debt service and maintenance capital expenditures  and to restrict discretionary capital expenditures 
we have scheduled debt maturities of million in and million in in february  we announced our decision to dispose of non strategic hotels over the next months 
these non strategic hotels include smaller hotels in secondary or tertiary markets and certain hotels in texas  and specifically in dallas  areas where we want to reduce our concentration of hotels 
we will seek to sell to million of these non strategic hotels that are unencumbered by debt and management agreement reinvestment requirements during  and to use the proceeds from these sales to pay down debt 
maintenance of strong strategic relationships we benefit from strategic brand owner and manager relationships with hilton embassy suites hotels  hilton and doubletree  six continents hotels crowne plaza and holiday inn and starwood sheraton and westin 
these relationships enable us to work effectively with our managers to maintain operating margins and maximize operating cash flow from our hotels 
o hilton has a hotel system of approximately  hotels with more than  guest rooms worldwide  and is the largest operator of full service  all suite hotels in the united states 
hilton owns hilton hotels  conrad  embassy suites hotels  doubletree and doubletree guest suites brands among others 
subsidiaries of hilton managed of our hotels at december  hilton is a partner in joint ventures with us in the ownership of hotels and the development of a residential luxury condominium  and is the holder of a equity interest in certain of our consolidated subsidiaries owning six hotels 
o six continents hotels is the world s largest hotel company 
six continents hotels owns  operates or franchises more than  hotels with approximately  guest rooms in nearly countries around the world 
among the brands owned by six continents hotels are crowne plaza  holiday inn  holiday inn select  holiday inn express and inter continental 
subsidiaries of six continents hotels managed of our hotels at december   and also own approximately of our outstanding common stock 
on october   six continents plc announced a proposal to separate its hotel and soft drink businesses from its retail business  with the new hotel to be called intercontinental hotels group plc 
this separation is currently expected to be effective on or about april  o starwood is one of the world s largest hotel operating companies 
directly and through subsidiaries  starwood owns  leases  manages or franchises more than properties with approximately  rooms in more than countries 
subsidiaries of starwood managed of our hotels at december  starwood is a joint venture partner with us in the ownership of two hotels and a joint venture partner with us in the ownership of one hotel 
hotel renovation  redevelopment and rebranding we expect to continue to differentiate ourselves from many of our competitors by o our success in upgrading  renovating and or redeveloping our hotels to enhance their competitive position  and  in certain instances  rebranding them to improve their revenue generating capacity  and o our ongoing program for the maintenance of our upgraded hotel assets  which generally includes contribution of approximately of total annual room and suite revenue to a capital reserve for routine capital replacements and improvements  and adherence to a rigorous maintenance and repair program  resulting in the additional expenditure of approximately to of annual hotel revenues on maintenance of the hotels 
we have demonstrated our ability to successfully execute renovations 
during  we substantially completed a million renovation on our san diego  california holiday inn  we upgraded and converted the recently acquired southpark suite hotel in charlotte  north carolina to a doubletree guest suites hotel and started a million renovation project at the wyndham myrtle beach resort hotel  which will allow us to convert this hotel to a hilton hotel in april we believe that our historical capital expenditures should limit the need for future major renovation expenditures 
during  we made capital expenditures aggregating approximately million and we currently anticipate capital expenditures of between and million 
competition the hotel industry is highly competitive 
each of our hotels is located in a developed area that includes other hotel properties and competes for guests primarily with other full service and limited service hotels in its immediate vicinity and secondarily with other hotel properties in its geographic market 
we believe that brand recognition  location  the quality of the hotel and services provided  and price are the principal competitive factors affecting our hotels 
environmental matters we customarily obtain a phase i environmental survey from an independent environmental consultant before acquiring a hotel 
the principal purpose of a phase i survey is to identify indications of potential environmental contamination for which a property owner may have liability and  secondarily  to assess  to a limited extent  the potential for environmental regulatory compliance liabilities 
the phase i surveys of our hotels were designed to meet the requirements of the then current industry standards governing phase i surveys  and consistent with those requirements  none of the surveys involved testing of groundwater  soil or air 
accordingly  they do not represent evaluations of conditions at the studied sites that would be revealed only through such testing 
in addition  their assessment of environmental regulatory compliance issues was general in scope and was not a detailed determination of the hotel s complete environmental compliance status 
similarly  the surveys did not involve comprehensive analysis of potential offsite liability 
the phase i survey reports did not reveal any environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business  assets or results of operations  nor are we aware of any such liability 
nevertheless  it is possible that these reports do not reveal or accurately assess all environmental liabilities and that there are material environmental liabilities of which we are unaware 
we believe that our hotels are in compliance  in all material respects  with all federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations regarding hazardous substances and other environmental matters  the violation of which would have a material adverse effect on us 
we have not been notified by any governmental authority or private party of any material noncompliance  liability or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances or other environmental matters in connection with any of our current or former properties 
however  obligations for compliance with environmental laws that arise or are discovered in the future may adversely affect our financial condition 
tax status we elected to be taxed as a reit under the federal income tax laws  commencing with our initial taxable year ended december  as a reit  we generally are not subject to federal income taxation at the corporate level on our taxable income that is distributed to our stockholders 
we may  however  be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and property 
a reit is subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement that it currently distribute annually at least of its taxable income 
in connection with our election to be taxed as a reit  our charter imposes restrictions on the ownership and transfer of shares of our common stock 
felcor lp expects to make distributions on its units sufficient to enable us to meet our distribution obligations as a reit 
as a result of the passage of the reit modernization act  in we acquired or terminated all of our hotel leases and contributed them to trss 
these trss are subject to both federal and state income taxes 
employees mr 
thomas j 
corcoran  jr  our president and chief executive officer  entered into an employment agreement with us in that continues in effect until december   and automatically renews for successive one year terms unless terminated by either party 
our other executive officers have change in control contracts that renew annually 
we had full time employees at december all persons employed in the day to day operation of our hotels are employees of the management companies engaged by us  and are not our employees 
cautionary factors that may affect future results certain statements and analyses contained in this annual report on form k  in our annual report to shareholders  or that may in the future be made by  or be attributable to  us  may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  and can be identified by the use of forward looking terminology such as may  will  expect  anticipate  estimate or continue or the negative thereof or other variations thereon or comparable terminology 
all of such forward looking statements are based upon present expectations and assumptions that may or may not actually occur 
the following factors constitute cautionary statements identifying important factors  including material risks and uncertainties  with respect to such forward looking statements that could cause actual results to differ materially from those reflected in such forward looking statements or in our historical results 
each of the following factors  among others  could adversely affect our ability to meet the current expectations of management 
terrorist activities and the potential of a military conflict in iraq have adversely affected  and created uncertainty in  our business the terrorist attacks of september   caused a significant disruption in travel related businesses in the united states 
consistent with the rest of the lodging industry  we experienced substantial declines in occupancy and adr due to a decline in both business and leisure travel 
in  the economic slowdown  the increasing likelihood of war with iraq and continued threats of terrorism continued to restrict travel and lodging demand 
the commencement of war in iraq  and the actual or threatened bankruptcy of several major airlines could result in further decreases in travel 
we are unable to predict with certainty when or if travel and lodging demand will be fully restored to historically normal levels 
military actions against terrorists  new terrorist attacks actual or threatened  the military conflict in iraq  and other political or economic events may cause a lengthy period of uncertainty that could continue to adversely affect the lodging industry  including us  as a result of customer reluctance to travel 
our financial leverage is high due to depressed operating cash flows at december   our consolidated debt of billion equaled of our total market capitalization and of our investment in hotel assets  at cost 
our consolidated debt to ebitda ratio for the year ended december   was times 
the decline in our revenues and cash flow from operations during and  have adversely affected our public debt ratings and may limit our access to additional debt capital 
historically  we have incurred debt for acquisitions and to fund our renovation  redevelopment and rebranding program and a share repurchase program 
at december   we had o approximately billion in consolidated debt  of which approximately million was secured by mortgages or capital leases  and o a ratio of ebitda to cash interest paid  including interest expense from unconsolidated entities  for the year then ended of x 
the current economic slowdown  which began in early and which was exacerbated by the terrorist attacks of september   has resulted in declines in revpar during both and  compared to the prior years 
if the economic slowdown and the reduced revpar experienced in and worsen  or continue for a protracted period of time  they could have a material adverse effect on our operations and earnings  including our ability to pay dividends and service our debt 
as a consequence of the economic slowdown in our business  and in the travel and lodging industries generally  standard poor s lowered its ratings on our billion in senior unsecured debt from bb to b  in february although moody s affirmed its current rating on our senior unsecured debt in february ba  we remain on negative outlook 
should moody s downgrade its ratings to b  the interest rate on million of our billion senior unsecured debt would increase by basis points  which would increase our interest expense by approximately million on an annual basis 
our leverage could have important consequences 
for example  it could o limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  renovation  redevelopment and rebranding plans  acquisitions  debt service requirements and other purposes  o require us to agree to additional restrictions and limitations on our business operations and capital structure to obtain additional or continued financing  o increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions  as well as to fluctuations in interest rates  o require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our debt  thereby reducing funds available for operations  future business opportunities  payment of dividends or other purposes  o limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we compete  and o place us at a competitive disadvantage  compared to our competitors that have less debt 
we have restrictive debt covenants that could adversely affect our ability to run our business the indentures governing our existing senior unsecured notes and the agreements governing our line of credit contain various restrictive covenants including  among others  provisions that can restrict our ability to o incur indebtedness  o make common and preferred distributions  o make investments  o make investments in capital expenditures and acquiring hotels in excess of certain amounts  o engage in transactions with affiliates  o incur liens  o merge or consolidate with another person  o dispose of all or substantially all of our assets  and o permit limitations on the ability of our subsidiaries to make payments to us 
these restrictions may adversely affect our ability to finance our operations or engage in other business activities that may be in our best interest 
in addition  some of these agreements require us to maintain certain specified financial ratios 
our ability to comply with such ratios may be adversely affected by events beyond our control 
in  we entered into two amendments to our line of credit 
in june  we amended our line of credit to relax covenant levels to provide us with greater financial flexibility 
in december  we further amended our line of credit to relax covenant levels and reduce the line to million from million 
the maturity of the line of credit remains at october   but we have the right to extend the maturity date for two consecutive one year periods  subject to certain conditions 
we recorded a million expense to write off unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the reduction in our line of credit 
although we were in compliance with our existing covenants prior to the amendments  it was necessary to amend the line of credit in anticipation of a continued negative revpar environment 
the amended line allows for the relaxation of certain financial covenants through the maturity date  with a step up in covenants on june   including the unsecured interest coverage  fixed charge coverage  secured leverage  and total leverage tests 
the interest rate remains on the same floating rate basis with a tiered spread based on our debt leverage ratio  but with an added tier to reflect higher permitted leverage 
there was no amount outstanding under the facility at december  unless our business and cash flow stabilizes  we may not be able to satisfy the relaxed financial covenant requirements 
in such an event  we may need to obtain further amendments from our lenders on the line of credit to continue being able to borrow under it 
we are not certain whether  to what extent  or upon what terms the lenders may be willing to continue a relaxation of the covenants 
further amendments to our line of credit may result in additional restrictions on us that  together with any limitation on our ability to borrow under the line  may adversely affect our ability to run our business and manage our financial affairs 
the breach of any of these covenants and limitations under our line of credit could result in the acceleration of amounts outstanding under our line of credit 
our failure to satisfy any accelerated indebtedness  if in the amount of million or more  could result in the acceleration of most of our other unsecured recourse indebtedness 
we may not be able to refinance or repay our debt in full under those circumstances 
conflicts of interest could adversely affect our business certain felcor directors 
six continents hotels currently manages of our hotels 
richard c 
north  who joined felcor s board during  is the chief executive officer of six continents plc hotels division  which  through its affiliates  owns approximately of our outstanding common stock 
issues may arise under the management contracts  and in the allocation of acquisition and management opportunities  that present conflicts of interest due to the relationship of mr 
north to the companies with which he is associated 
as an example  in the event we enter into new or additional hotel management contracts or other transactions with six continents hotels  the interests of mr 
north  by virtue of his relationship with six continents hotels  may conflict with our interests 
any increase in management fees payable to six continents hotels may decrease our profits to the benefit of six continents hotels 
also  in the selection of brands under which our hotels will be operated  mr 
north  by virtue of his relationship with six continents hotels  may have interests that conflict with our interests 
we anticipate that any director who has a conflict of interest with respect to an issue presented to the felcor board will abstain from voting upon that issue  although he or she will have no legal obligation to do so 
we have no provisions in our bylaws or charter that require an interested director to abstain from voting upon an issue 
we do not expect to add provisions in our charter and bylaws to this effect 
although each director has a fiduciary duty of loyalty to us  there is a risk that  should an interested director vote upon an issue in which he or one of his affiliates has an interest  his vote may reflect a bias that could be contrary to our best interests 
in addition  even if an interested director abstains from voting  the director s participation in the meeting and discussion of an issue in which he or companies with which he is associated have an interest could influence the votes of other directors regarding the issue 
for information regarding the management agreements entered into by us with six continents hotels and others  reference is made to the description of these agreements under the caption management agreements in item of this annual report on form k 
adverse tax consequences to affiliates on a sale of some hotels 
mr 
corcoran and mr 
robert a 
mathewson  a director  may incur additional tax liability if we sell our investments in six hotels that we acquired in july from partnerships in which they were investors 
consequently  our interests could differ from messrs 
corcoran s and mathewson s interests in the event that we consider a sale of any of these hotels 
decisions regarding a sale of any of these six hotels must be made by a majority of the independent directors 
we may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits of our renovations the majority of our hotels recently have been substantially renovated  redeveloped and  in some cases  rebranded 
the completed improvements may not achieve the results anticipated when we made the decision to invest in the improvements 
we will encounter industry related risks that may adversely affect our business the current economic slowdown has had a significant adverse effect on our revpar performance and earnings 
if it worsens or continues  the effects on our financial condition could be material 
we have experienced declines in revpar  beginning in march and continuing through august a sharper than anticipated decline in business travel was the primary cause of the decline  which was reflected in decreased occupancies  which led to declines in room rates as hotels competed more aggressively for guests  both of which have had a significant adverse effect on our revpar and operating performance 
on a national basis  the hotel industry experienced a revpar decline of for the year ended december   and for the year ended december  if the economic slowdown worsens  or continues for a protracted period of time  it could have a material adverse effect on our operations  earnings and financial condition 
investing in hotel assets involves special risks 
we have invested in hotel related assets  and our hotels are subject to all of the risks common to the hotel industry 
these risks could adversely affect hotel occupancy and the rates that can be charged for hotel rooms  and generally include o competition from other hotels  o construction of more hotel rooms in a particular area than needed to meet demand  o increases in energy costs and other travel expenses that reduce business and leisure travel  o adverse effects of declines in general and local economic activity  o fluctuations in our revenue caused by the seasonal nature of the hotel industry  o adverse effects of a downturn in the hotel industry  and o risks generally associated with the ownership of hotels and real estate  as discussed below 
we could face increased competition 
each of our hotels competes with other hotels in its geographic area 
a number of additional hotel rooms have been or may be built in a number of the geographic areas in which our hotels are located  which could adversely affect the results of operations of these hotels 
an oversupply of hotel rooms could adversely affect both occupancy and rates in the markets in which our hotels are located 
a significant increase in the supply of midprice  upscale and upper upscale hotel rooms and suites  if demand fails to increase proportionately  could have a severe adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we face reduced coverages and increased costs of insurance 
following the events of september   certain types of insurance coverage  such as for acts of terrorism  are only available at high cost 
in an effort to keep our cost of insurance within reasonable limits  we have only purchased terrorism insurance for those hotels that are secured by mortgage debt  as required by our lenders 
we have established a self insured retention of  per occurrence for general liability insurance with regard to of our hotels  the remainder of our hotels participate in general liability programs of our managers  with no deductible 
our property program has a  all risk deductible  a deductible of of insured value for named windstorm coverage and a deductible of of insured value for california earthquake coverage 
should such uninsured or not fully insured losses be substantial  they could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and cash flows 
we have geographic concentrations that may create risks from regional economic and weather conditions 
approximately of our hotel rooms and of our hotel ebitda for the year ended december   were generated from hotels located in four states california  florida  georgia and texas 
additionally  we have concentrations in three major metropolitan areas  atlanta  san francisco bay area and dallas  which represented approximately of our hotel ebitda for the year ended december  therefore  adverse economic or weather conditions in these states or metropolitan areas will have a greater effect on us than similar conditions in other states 
we have designated hotels as non strategic and intend to sell them within the next months 
we may be unable to sell the hotels at acceptable prices  or at all  within the proposed time frame  and we may be unable to acquire suitable replacement properties at acceptable prices  or at all  which could trigger substantial penalties payable to six continents hotels under our management agreements 
furthermore  if we sell these hotels and fail to reinvest the net proceeds in assets with returns equal to  or better than  the hotels sold  our results of operations will be adversely affected 
we are subject to possible adverse effects of franchise and licensing agreement requirements 
substantially all of our hotels are operated under existing franchise or license agreements with nationally recognized hotel brands 
each such agreement requires that the licensed hotel be maintained and operated in accordance with specific standards and restrictions in order to maintain uniformity within the franchisor system 
compliance with these standards could require us to incur significant expenses or capital expenditures  which could adversely affect our results of operations and ability to make distributions to our stockholders and payments on our indebtedness 
also  changes to these standards could conflict with a hotel s specific business plan or limit our ability to make improvements or modifications to a hotel without the consent of the brand owner 
if such an agreement terminates due to our failure to make required improvements  we may be liable to the brand manager or franchisor for a termination payment 
these termination payments vary by agreement and hotel 
the loss of a substantial number of brand licenses  and the related termination payments  could have a material adverse effect on our business because of the loss of associated name recognition  marketing support and centralized reservation systems provided by the brand manager or franchisor 
the franchise agreements could also expire or terminate  with specified renewal rights  at various times 
as a condition to renew  the franchise agreements could involve a renewal application process that would require substantial capital improvements to be made to the hotels for which we would be responsible 
the agreements providing franchise licenses with respect to of our hotels expire within the next five years 
we are subject to the risks of brand concentration 
we are subject to the potential risks associated with concentration of our hotels under a limited number of brands 
a negative public image or other adverse event that becomes associated with the brand could adversely affect hotels operated under that brand 
the following percentages of our hotels ebitda were generated by hotels operated under each of the indicated brands during the year ended december  o embassy suites hotels o holiday inn branded hotels o crowne plaza o sheraton o doubletree branded hotels should any of these brands suffer a significant decline in popularity with the traveling public  it could adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
we are subject to the risks of hotel operations 
through our ownership of our lessees  we are subject to the risk of fluctuating hotel operating expenses at our hotels  including but not limited to o wage and benefit costs  o repair and maintenance expenses  o the costs of gas and electricity  o the costs of insurance  including health  general liability and workers compensation  and o other operating expenses 
these operating expenses are more difficult to predict and control than revenue  resulting in an increased risk of volatility in our results of operations 
the lodging business is seasonal in nature 
generally  hotel revenues for our hotel portfolio are greater in the second and third calendar quarters than in the first and fourth calendar quarters  although this may not be true for hotels in major tourist destinations 
revenues for hotels in tourist areas generally are substantially greater during tourist season than other times of the year 
seasonal variations in revenue at our hotels can be expected to cause quarterly fluctuations in our revenues 
quarterly earnings also may be adversely affected by events beyond our control  such as extreme weather conditions  economic factors and other considerations affecting travel 
we lack control over the management and operations of our hotels 
we are dependent on the ability of unaffiliated third party managers to operate and manage our hotels 
in order to maintain our reit status  we cannot operate our hotels or any subsequently acquired hotels 
as a result  we are unable to directly implement strategic business decisions for the operation and marketing of our hotels  such as decisions with respect to the setting of room rates  the salary and benefits provided to hotel employees  the conduct of food and beverage operations and similar matters 
our ability to grow or sustain our business may be limited by our ability to attract debt or equity financing and we may have difficulty accessing capital on attractive terms we may not be able to fund future growth and operations solely from cash provided from operating activities because of recent declines in cash flows and our requirement to distribute at least of our taxable income each year to maintain our status as a reit 
consequently  we rely upon the availability of debt or equity capital to fund hotel acquisitions and discretionary capital improvements and we may be dependent upon our ability to attract debt financing from public or institutional lenders 
the capital markets have been adversely affected by the occurrence of recent events  including the possibility of war in iraq  the terrorist attacks on september   the ongoing war against terrorism by the united states and the bankruptcy of several major companies  such as enron corp 
these events  or an escalation in the anti terrorism war  new terrorist attacks  the war in iraq or additional bankruptcies in the future  could adversely affect the availability and cost of capital for our business 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in attracting sufficient debt or equity financing to fund future growth and operations at an acceptable cost  or at all 
we own and may acquire interests in hotel ventures with third parties that expose us to some risk of additional liabilities we own  through our subsidiaries  interests in several real estate ventures with third parties 
those ventures that are not consolidated into our financial statements  own a total of hotels  in which we have an aggregate investment of approximately million 
the operations of of these hotels are included in our consolidated results of operations due to our ownership of the lessee of the hotels 
none of our directors or officers holds any interest in any of these ventures 
the ventures and hotels were subject to non recourse mortgage loans aggregating approximately million at december  additionally  one joint venture had a million advance type construction loan for a residential condominium development that has been guaranteed equally on a several basis by us and our joint venture partner 
at december   there was million outstanding on this loan  of which we have guaranteed our pro rata share of million at december  the personal liability of our subsidiaries under the non recourse loans is generally limited to the guaranty of the borrowing ventures personal obligations to pay for the lender s losses caused by misconduct  fraud or misappropriation of funds by the ventures and other typical exceptions from the non recourse covenants in the mortgages  such as those relating to environmental liability 
we may invest in other ventures in the future that own hotels and have recourse or non recourse debt financing 
if a venture defaults under its mortgage loan  the lender may accelerate the loan and demand payment in full before taking action to foreclose on the hotel 
as a partner or member in any of these ventures  our subsidiary may be exposed to liability for claims asserted against the venture  and the venture may not have sufficient assets or insurance to discharge the liability 
our subsidiaries may not legally be able to control decisions being made regarding these ventures and their hotels 
in addition  the hotels in a venture may perform at levels below expectations  resulting in the potential for insolvency of the venture unless the partners or members provide additional funds 
in some ventures  the partners or members may elect to make additional capital contributions 
in many of the foregoing events  we may be faced with the choice of losing our investment in the venture or investing more capital in it with no guaranty of receiving a return on that investment 
we are subject to potential tax risks the federal income tax laws governing reits are complex 
we have operated and intend to continue to operate in a manner that is intended to enable us to qualify as a reit under the federal income tax laws 
the reit qualification requirements are extremely complicated  and interpretations of the federal income tax laws governing qualification as a reit are limited 
accordingly  we cannot be certain that we have been  or will continue to be  successful in operating so as to qualify as a reit 
at any time  new laws  interpretations or court decisions may change the federal tax laws relating to  or the federal income tax consequences of  qualification as a reit 
failure to make required distributions would subject us to tax 
each year  a reit must pay out to its stockholders at least of its taxable income  other than any net capital gain 
to the extent that we satisfy the applicable distribution requirement  but distribute less than of our taxable income  we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income 
in addition  we will be subject to a nondeductible tax if the actual amount we pay out to our stockholders in a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under federal tax laws 
our only source of funds to make such distributions comes from distributions to us from felcor lp 
accordingly  we may be required to borrow money or sell assets to make distributions sufficient to pay out enough of our taxable income to satisfy the applicable distribution requirement and to avoid corporate income tax and the tax in a particular year 
failure to qualify as a reit would subject us to federal income tax 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we would be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income 
we might need to borrow money or sell hotels in order to pay any such tax 
if we cease to be a reit  we no longer would be required to distribute most of our taxable income to our stockholders 
unless our failure to qualify as a reit were excused under federal income tax laws  we could not re elect reit status until the fifth calendar year following the year in which we failed to qualify 
failure to have distributed earnings and profits of bristol hotel company in could cause us to fail to qualify as a reit 
at the end of any taxable year  a reit may not have any accumulated earnings and profits  described generally for federal income tax purposes as cumulative undistributed net income  from a non reit corporation 
in connection with the merger of bristol hotel company  or bristol  with and into us in  arthur andersen llp prepared and provided to us its computation of bristol s accumulated earnings and profits through the date of the merger  and we made a corresponding special distribution to our stockholders 
however  the determination of accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes is extremely complex and the computations by any professional service firm are not binding upon the internal revenue service 
should the internal revenue service successfully assert that bristol s accumulated earnings and profits were greater than the amount so distributed by us  we may fail to qualify as a reit 
alternatively  the internal revenue service may permit felcor to avoid losing its reit status by paying a deficiency dividend to eliminate any remaining accumulated earnings and profits of bristol 
there can be no assurance  however  that we would be able to make any such required distribution or that the internal revenue service would not assert loss of reit status as the penalty for failing to distribute any accumulated earnings and profits of bristol in a sale of assets acquired from bristol within ten years after the merger may result in corporate income tax 
if we sell any asset acquired from bristol within ten years after our merger with bristol  and we recognize a taxable gain on the sale  we will be taxed at the highest corporate rate on an amount equal to the lesser of o the amount of gain that we recognize at the time of the sale  or o the amount of gain that we would have recognized if we had sold the asset at the time of the bristol merger for its then fair market value 
the sales of bristol hotels that have been made to date have not resulted in any material amount of tax liability 
if we are successful in selling the hotels that we have designated as non strategic  the majority of which are bristol hotels  we could incur corporate income tax with respect to the related built in gain  the amount of which cannot yet be determined 
departure of key personnel  including mr 
corcoran  could adversely affect our future operating results we will encounter risks that may adversely affect real estate ownership general risks 
our investments in hotels are subject to the numerous risks generally associated with owning real estate  including among others o adverse changes in general or local economic or real estate market conditions  o changes in zoning laws  o changes in traffic patterns and neighborhood characteristics  o increases in assessed valuation and real estate tax rates  o increases in the cost of property insurance  o governmental regulations and fiscal policies  o the potential for uninsured or underinsured property losses  o the impact of environmental laws and regulations  and o other circumstances beyond our control 
moreover  real estate investments are relatively illiquid  and we may not be able to vary our portfolio in response to changes in economic and other conditions 
compliance with environmental laws may adversely affect our financial condition 
owners of real estate are subject to numerous federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations 
under these laws and regulations  a current or former owner of real estate may be liable for the costs of remediating hazardous substances found on its property  whether or not it was responsible for their presence 
in addition  if an owner of real property arranges for the disposal of hazardous substances at another site  it may also be liable for the costs of remediating the disposal site  even if it did not own or operate the disposal site 
such liability may be imposed without regard to fault or the legality of a party s conduct and may  in certain circumstances  be joint and several 
a property owner may also be liable to third parties for personal injuries or property damage sustained as a result of its release of hazardous or toxic substances  including asbestos containing materials  into the environment 
environmental laws and regulations may require us to incur substantial expenses and limit the use of our properties 
we could have substantial liability for a failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations  which may be enforced by the government or  in certain instances  by private parties 
the existence of hazardous substances on a property can also adversely affect the value of  and the owner s ability to use  sell or borrow against  the property 
we cannot provide assurances that future or amended laws or regulations  or more stringent interpretations or enforcement of existing environmental requirements  will not impose any material environmental liability  or that the environmental condition or liability relating to the hotels will not be affected by new information or changed circumstances  by the condition of properties in the vicinity of such hotels  such as the presence of leaking underground storage tanks  or by the actions of unrelated third parties 
compliance with the americans with disabilities act may adversely affect our financial condition 
under the americans with disabilities act of  all public accommodations  including hotels  are required to meet certain federal requirements for access and use by disabled persons 
various state and local jurisdictions have also adopted requirements relating to the accessibility of buildings to disabled persons 
we believe that our hotels substantially comply with the requirements of the americans with disabilities act and other applicable laws 
however  a determination that the hotels are not in compliance with such laws could result in liability for both governmental fines and payments to private parties 
if we were required to make unanticipated major modifications to the hotels to comply with the requirements of the americans with disabilities act and other similar laws  it could adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and to pay our obligations 
our charter contains limitations on ownership and transfer of shares of our stock that could adversely affect attempted transfers of our common stock to maintain our status as a reit  no more than in value of our outstanding stock may be owned  actually or constructively  under the applicable tax rules  by five or fewer persons during the last half of any taxable year 
our charter prohibits  subject to some exceptions  any person from owning more than  as determined in accordance with the internal revenue code and the exchange act  of the number of outstanding shares of any class of our stock 
our charter also prohibits any transfer of our stock that would result in a violation of the ownership limit  reduce the number of stockholders below or otherwise result in our failure to qualify as a reit 
any attempted transfer of shares in violation of the charter prohibitions will be void  and the intended transferee will not acquire any right in those shares 
we have the right to take any lawful action that we believe necessary or advisable to ensure compliance with these ownership and transfer restrictions and to preserve our status as a reit  including refusing to recognize any transfer of stock in violation of our charter 
some provisions in our charter and bylaws and maryland law make a takeover of us more difficult ownership limit 
the ownership and transfer restrictions of our charter may have the effect of discouraging or preventing a third party from attempting to gain control of us without the approval of our board of directors 
accordingly  it is less likely that a change in control  even if beneficial to stockholders  could be effected without the approval of our board 
staggered board 
our board of directors is divided into three classes 
directors in each class are elected for terms of three years 
as a result  the ability of stockholders to effect a change in control of us through the election of new directors is limited by the inability of stockholders to elect a majority of our board at any particular meeting 
authority to issue additional shares 
under our charter  our board of directors may issue preferred stock without stockholder action 
the preferred stock may be issued  in one or more series  with the preferences and other terms designated by our board that may delay or prevent a change in control of us  even if the change is in the best interests of stockholders 
we currently have outstanding  shares of our series a preferred stock and  shares  represented by  depositary shares  of our series b preferred stock 
the preferred stock reduces the amount of dividends available  and has dividend  liquidation and other rights superior  to the holders of our common stock 
maryland takeover statutes 
as a maryland corporation  we are subject to various provisions under the maryland general corporation law  including the maryland business combination statute  that may have the effect of delaying or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for the stock or otherwise be in the best interests of stockholders 
under the maryland business combination statute  some business combinations  including some issuances of equity securities  between a maryland corporation and an interested stockholder  which is any person who beneficially owns or more of the voting power of the corporation s shares  or an affiliate of that stockholder  are prohibited for five years after the most recent date on which the interested stockholder becomes an interested stockholder 
any of these business combinations must be approved by a stockholder vote meeting two separate super majority requirements unless  among other conditions  the corporation s common stockholders receive a minimum price  as defined in the statute  for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested stockholder for its common shares 
our charter currently provides that the maryland control share statute will not apply to any of our existing or future stock 
that statute may deny voting rights to shares involved in an acquisition of one tenth or more of the voting stock of a maryland corporation 
to the extent these or other laws are applicable to us  they may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us even though beneficial to our stockholders

we raised a net total of million in new equity capital during  through the issuance of our series b preferred stock  and had no borrowings under our line of credit at december  financial comparison years ended december  change change in millions  except revpar revenue per available room revpar funds from operations ffo earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda net income loss the net loss for the year ended december   includes million in impairment related charges  principally associated with our decision to sell non strategic hotels over the next months 
the net loss for the year ended december   includes million of expenses  consisting of merger termination costs of million  merger related financing costs of million  lease termination costs of million  swap termination costs of million  a loss on assets held for sale of million  abandoned project write offs of million and a loss of million from the write off of deferred loan costs 
the net income for the year ended december   was reduced by a million loss recognized to reflect the difference between our book value and the estimated realizable value of non strategic hotel assets that we decided to sell  and a million loss from the write off of deferred loan costs 
revpar decline we experienced declines in revpar from march through august an overall decline in both business and leisure travel was reflected in decreased occupancies  which led to declines in room rates as hotels competed more aggressively for guests  both of which had a significant adverse effect on our revpar and operating performance 
our hotel revpar declined in  compared to on a national basis  the hotel industry experienced revpar declines of and for and  respectively 
our hotel occupancies declined by only in  compared to  while our average daily rates adr declined from those experienced in in  our hotels had a basis point drop in pro forma hotel operating margins from the prior year 
the compression in margins was principally related to improving occupancies of our hotels coupled with decreasing adr 
also affecting hotel margins were increases in employee related costs  marketing  and repair and maintenance costs 
we continue to actively work with our brand managers to increase revenues and control operating costs  while still maintaining the satisfaction and security of our hotel guests 
sale of non strategic hotels in february  we announced our plan to sell non strategic hotels over the next months  six of which had been previously designated as held for sale 
these non strategic hotels include smaller hotels in secondary or tertiary markets and include some texas hotels  and specifically  hotels in dallas  texas an area in which we desire to reduce our concentration of hotels 
it is our intention to reinvest most of the proceeds from these sales in newer  larger and higher quality hotels  primarily in urban and resort locations with higher growth rates and barriers to competition 
for those hotels currently managed by six continents hotels  we are liable for liquidated damages under the terms of our management agreement  unless we reinvest the net proceeds to purchase one or more hotels licensed and managed by six continents hotels within one year of the sale 
we will seek to sell to million of these non strategic hotels that are unencumbered by debt and management agreement reinvestment requirements during  and use the proceeds from these sales to pay down debt 
we recorded million in impairment related losses in  principally related to shorter hold periods associated with our decision to sell these non strategic hotels 
the hotels identified as non strategic represent of our hotel rooms  but less than of our consolidated hotel ebitda 
these non strategic hotels have an average of rooms  while the average number of rooms for the remainder of our portfolio is results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and on july   we acquired operating leases covering of our hotels and contributed them to our taxable reit subsidiaries  or trss 
as the leases were acquired  we began receiving and recording hotel revenues and expenses  rather than percentage lease revenue  for these hotels 
consequently  the historical results for the year ended december   and the year ended december   are not directly comparable 
we recorded a net loss applicable to common shareholders of million in  compared to a net loss of million in the principal components of the loss were impairment related charges of million  principally related to shorter holding periods associated with our decision to sell non strategic hotels  the decrease in hotel revpar of  and contraction of hotel operating margins  principally associated with the decline in revpar 
total revenue for the year ended december   increased million over the increase is principally associated with reporting hotel operating revenues for of the hotels during the first six months of  of million  contrasted with percentage lease revenue we reported for these hotels during the same period in  of million 
this increase was partially offset by a million reduction in hotel operating revenues and an million net reduction from disposition and acquisition of hotels during the periods reported 
total operating expenses increased million for the year ended december   over this increase primarily resulted from the inclusion of million in hotel operating expenses  management fees and other property related costs for the hotels during the first six months of that were not included in the same period of  prior to our acquisition of the leases 
offsetting this increase were million of merger termination costs associated with the termination of the meristar hospitality merger and million of lease termination costs associated with the acquisition of hotel leases that were recorded in taxes  insurance and lease expense decreased million  principally as the result of decreases in lease expense of million  and property taxes of million  partially offset by increased insurance costs of million 
the decrease in lease expense is related to participating leases that are based principally on revenues 
property taxes decreased principally from the resolutions of prior year property tax disputes 
included in the year ended december   were million of abandoned project costs related to our pursuit of a large portfolio acquisition 
we were unable to reach mutually acceptable pricing and terms with the seller as a result of the uncertain operating environment and softening capital markets 
the year ended december   included million of abandoned project costs 
recurring interest expense  net of interest income  increased million for the year ended december   over the increase is primarily related to excess cash that we carried during  an increase in average debt outstanding of million  over  and higher average interest rates in resulting from our senior unsecured notes issued during the year ended december   included a million charge off of capitalized costs from reduced line commitments 
the prior year included million of merger related financing costs related to the million in senior debt that was repaid in october  and a million loss related to the charge off of capitalized costs from reduced line commitments 
also in  in connection with the issuance of favorably priced fixed rate debt and the prepayment of floating rate debt  we terminated million of interest rate swaps  resulting in a million swap termination cost 
we recorded impairment related losses of million during the fourth quarter of of these losses  million primarily related to shorter holding periods associated with our recent decision to sell hotels over the next months 
six of these hotels had been identified for sale in prior periods and were included in the hotels for which an impairment loss of million was recorded in of the remaining impairment charge million related to two hotels held for investment that are not included in the disposition plan and million related to an other than temporary decline in the value of certain equity method investments 
equity in the income of unconsolidated entities decreased by million  compared to the decrease in principally resulted from the previously described million impairment loss and an drop in revpar from our unconsolidated hotels 
minority interest increased million for the year ended december   over minority interest represents the proportionate share of our net income or loss held by minority owners of felcor lp and the proportionate share of the income or loss of other consolidated subsidiaries not owned by felcor 
of this change  million resulted from the felcor lp minority interest holders share of our losses and million from decreases in the proportionate share of income of other consolidated entities not owned by us 
partially offsetting the net loss for the year ended december   was a gain of million on the sale of retail space and million on the sale of a hotel 
the net loss for the year ended december   was reduced by a gain of million related to condemnation proceeds received and a gain of million on the sale of land 
comparison of the year ended december  with pro forma on july   we acquired the operating leases covering of our hotels and contributed them to our trss 
as the leases were acquired  we began receiving and recording hotel revenues and expenses  rather than percentage lease revenue 
consequently  a comparison of historical results for the year ended december   to the year ended december   may not be as meaningful as a discussion of pro forma results 
accordingly  we have included a discussion of the comparison of the pro forma results of operations

the pro forma numbers presented represent our historical revenues and expenses  modified as described in the pro forma adjustments below 
pro forma adjustments a total revenue adjustments consist of the increase in our historical revenue from the elimination of historical percentage lease revenue and the addition of historical hotel operating revenues 
b hotel operating expense adjustments consist of i the increase in our historical operating expense from the addition of historical hotel operating expenses and the elimination of percentage lease expense for the hotel leases acquired from six continents hotels on july   ii the recording of management fees at their new contractual rates  and iii the elimination of historical franchise fees  which are included in the new management fees for these hotels 
revenues decreased million in  compared to pro forma the decrease in revenue resulted principally from a decline in both business and leisure travel for the year ended december  compared to  which reflected the weak economy and political uncertainties during the period 
during the year ended december   revpar for our hotels decreased  compared to the prior year pro forma  the decline in revpar was comprised of a decrease in hotel occupancy of percentage points or  to  and a decline in adr of  to 
hotel operating expenses decreased million in  compared to pro forma this decrease is primarily related to a decrease in the expenses from hotel operations associated with the decrease in revpar 
however  hotel operating expenses  as a percentage of total revenue  increased from to 
the principal reason for the increase in operating expenses  as a percentage of total revenue  was a basis point drop in hotel operating margins 
this margin compression primarily relates to the reduction in revenue and the inability to reduce labor costs  repair and maintenance costs and marketing costs proportionately 
we are actively working with our managers to implement cost cutting programs at our hotels to maximize hotel operating profits 
these measures include reducing labor costs  streamlining staffing  and consolidating operations by closing unused floors in hotels when possible 
included in the year ended december   were million of abandoned project costs related to our pursuit of a large portfolio acquisition 
we were unable to reach mutually acceptable pricing and terms with the seller as a result of the uncertain operating environment and softening capital markets 
the year ended december   included million of abandoned project costs 
included in the prior year were million in lease termination costs  associated with the acquisition of our hotel leases and million of costs associated with the termination of the proposed meristar hospitality merger 
our operating income was million in  compared to pro forma operating income of million in the pro forma operating income included million in costs associated with abandoned project costs  lease termination costs and merger termination costs 
the principal reasons for this decline in pro forma total revenues and pro forma hotel operating expenses were an decline in revpar and the contraction of hotel operating margins principally associated with the decline in revpar 
comparison of the years ended december  and prior to december   we leased hotels to either djont or six continents hotels and reported the lease revenue from the percentage lease agreements 
our historical revenues for represented  principally  rental income on leases 
expenses during this period represented specific ownership costs  including real estate and property taxes  property insurance and ground leases 
effective january   through our trss  we acquired of these hotel leases and  effective july   acquired the leases on our remaining hotels  assuming all operating risks and rewards of these hotels 
as a result of acquiring these leases  we reported hotel operating revenues and expenses 
our expenses included all hotel operating costs  including management fees  salary expenses  hotel marketing  utilities  and food and beverage costs  in addition to ownership costs 
accordingly  operating results for the year ended december   are not directly comparable to for the year ended december   we recorded total revenues of billion  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in total revenues of million is principally associated with reporting hotel operating revenues in  rather than the percentage lease revenue reported in the previous year 
the hotels acquired from djont contributed approximately million in hotel operating revenue in  compared to million in percentage lease revenue for the hotels acquired july   from six continents hotels contributed approximately million in percentage lease revenue and million in hotel operating revenue  following the acquisition of these leases  compared to million in percentage lease revenue for these same hotels in total operating expense increased million for the year ended december   over  primarily as a result of the inclusion of hotel operating expenses  management fees and other property related costs of million  which were not included in  prior to our acquisition of the hotel leases 
also included in total operating expenses for are lease termination costs  merger termination costs  depreciation  taxes  insurance and lease expense  and corporate expenses 
taxes  insurance and lease expense increased by million for year ended december   over the majority of this increase is related to percentage lease expense paid to unconsolidated ventures owning hotels whose operations were acquired with the acquisition of djont 
we included in operating expenses million of costs associated with the acquisition of djont and the six continents hotels leases  and million of expenses associated with the termination of the meristar merger 
we also incurred million in merger related financing costs related to the million in senior debt that was repaid in october  as a result of the termination of the meristar merger 
in connection with the issuance of favorably priced fixed rate debt  and the prepayment of floating rate debt  we terminated million of interest rate swaps  resulting in a million swap termination cost 
in june  we announced our intention to sell non strategic hotels and  in  recorded an expense of million representing the difference between the net book value of these hotels and their estimated net proceeds from sale 
in  an additional million loss provision was recorded related to the remaining hotels held for sale 
equity in income from unconsolidated entities decreased million in  compared to the principal reasons for the decrease in were a gain of million recorded in from the development and sale of condominiums by an entity in which we own a equity interest and a decline in percentage lease revenue in from these unconsolidated entities  related to a decline in the revpar of the hotels owned by them during minority interests decreased million in  compared to this decrease in minority interest principally reflects felcor lp s partners share of our net loss of million in we recorded a net loss applicable to common stockholders of million in  compared to a net income of million in the principal components of the loss in were the decrease in hotel revpar of  contraction of hotel operating margins principally associated with the decline in revpar  costs of terminating the meristar merger of million  merger financing costs of million  lease termination costs of million associated with acquiring hotel leases  swap termination costs of million associated with repayment of variable rate debt  and a loss on assets held for sale of million 
comparison of the pro forma years ended december  and between january and july   we acquired the operating leases covering our hotels and contributed them to our trss 
as the leases were acquired  we began directly receiving and recording hotel revenues and expenses  rather than percentage lease revenue 
consequently  a comparison of historical results for the year ended december   to the year ended december   may not be as meaningful as a discussion of pro forma results 
accordingly  we have included a discussion of the comparison of the pro forma results of operations 
the pro forma results of operations for the years ended december   and assumes that the following occurred on january  o our acquisition of djont for  units of limited partnership interest in felcor lp  valued at approximately million  o our acquisition of hotel leases  together with their associated management contracts  from six continents hotels for  shares of our common stock  valued at approximately million  and o our acquisition of the remaining hotel leases held by six continents hotels

pro forma numbers presented represent our historical revenues and expenses  modified as described in the pro forma adjustments below 
pro forma adjustments a total revenue adjustments consist of the changes in our historical revenue from the elimination of historical percentage lease revenue and the addition of historical hotel operating revenues 
b hotel operating expense adjustments consist of i the increase in our historical operating expense from the addition of historical hotel operating expenses and the elimination of percentage lease expense  ii the recording of management fees at their new contractual rates  and iii the elimination of historical franchise fees  which are included in the new management fees for these hotels 
pro forma revenues decreased million in  primarily as a result of the economic downturn and disruptions in business and leisure travel following the terrorist attacks on september  as a result of these events  both business and leisure travel declined significantly during the year ended december   compared to during  our hotels revpar decreased  comprised of a decrease in occupancy of percentage points or  to  and a decline in adr of  to 
during the four week period following the terrorist attacks on september   our hotels recorded average occupancy rates as low as 
however  our hotel revpar performance improved throughout the fourth quarter  with revpar decreases compared to the prior year periods  of in october  in november  and in december 
pro forma hotel operating expenses decreased million in  compared to  but pro forma hotel operating expense as a percentage of total revenue increased from to 
the principal reason for the increased operating expense  as a percentage of total revenue  was a basis point drop in hotel operating margins gross operating profit less franchise and management fees 
this margin compression primarily related to increased labor costs  the cost of frequent guest programs and utility costs as a percentage of total revenue 
the increase in pro forma costs as a percentage of pro forma revenue is principally related to the decrease in hotel revenue previously discussed 
we have been actively working with our managers to implement cost cutting programs at the hotels to stabilize the hotels operating profits 
these measures include reducing labor costs  streamlining staffing  and consolidating operations by closing unused floors in hotels  when possible 
our pro forma operating income was million in  compared to pro forma operating income of million in the principal reasons for the drop in pro forma operating income were the decrease in pro forma hotel revpar of  contraction of pro forma operating margins principally associated with the decline in revpar  costs of terminating the meristar merger of million and lease termination costs of million associated with acquiring the hotel leases 
funds from operations and ebitda we consider ffo and ebitda to be key measures of a reit s performance and should be considered along with  but not as an alternative to  net income and cash flow as a measure of our operating performance and liquidity 
the white paper on funds from operations approved by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit defines ffo as net income or loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of properties  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization  after comparable adjustments for the applicable portion of these items related to unconsolidated entities and joint ventures 
we believe that ffo and ebitda are helpful to investors as a measure of the performance of an equity reit because  along with cash flow from operating activities  financing activities and investing activities  they provide investors with an indication of the ability of the reit to incur and service debt  to make capital expenditures  to pay dividends and to fund other cash needs 
we compute ffo in accordance with standards established by nareit  except that we add back certain significant non recurring items  such as lease termination costs  merger termination costs  merger financing costs  abandoned project costs  impairment losses  charge off of deferred financing costs and interest rate swap termination expenses to derive ffo 
this may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition  or that interpret the current nareit definition differently than we do 
ffo and ebitda do not represent cash generated from operating activities as determined by gaap  and should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of our financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity  nor does it necessarily reflect the funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to make cash distributions 
ffo and ebitda may include funds that may not be available for our discretionary use due to functional requirements to conserve funds for capital expenditures and property acquisitions  and other commitments and uncertainties 
the following table details our computation of ffo and ebitda in thousands years ended december  funds from operations ffo a net income loss    gain on sale of hotel assets   depreciation    depreciation from unconsolidated entities    preferred dividends series a preferred dividends  series b preferred dividends    minority interest in felcor lodging lp

liquidity and capital resources our principal source of cash to meet our cash requirements  including distributions to stockholders and repayments of indebtedness  is from the results of operations of our hotels 
for the year ended december   net cash flow provided by operating activities  consisting primarily of hotel operations  was million 
we currently expect that our operating cash flow for will be within the range of to million using current revpar forecasts 
our debt maturities for are million and we expect capital expenditures to be approximately to million 
cash necessary to fund cash flow shortfalls and distributions  if any  will be funded from our cash balances  which were approximately million at the date of this filing  proceeds from the sale of hotels or additional borrowings 
however  due to the sharp reduction in travel that began in  and the resultant drop in revpar and profits from our hotel operations  we expect our board of directors to defer future common dividends until our hotels experience a to increase in revpar  and to determine the amount of preferred dividends  if any  for each quarterly period  based upon the operating results of that quarter  economic conditions  other operating trends and minimum reit distribution requirements 
currently  we do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock during recent events  including the threat of additional terrorist attacks  the commencement of war in iraq and the bankruptcy of several major corporations  have had an adverse impact on the capital markets 
these events  new terrorist attacks  a prolonged war in iraq or additional bankruptcies could further adversely affect the availability and cost of capital for our business 
in addition  should the anticipated recovery of the overall economy  and of the lodging industry  continue to be delayed significantly  that too could adversely affect our operating cash flow and the availability and cost of capital for our business 
as a consequence of the economic slowdown in our business  and the travel and lodging industries generally  standard poor s lowered its ratings on our billion in senior unsecured debt from bb to b with a stable outlook  in february although moody s affirmed its current rating on our senior debt in february ba  we remain on negative outlook 
should moody s downgrade our current rating  the interest rate on million of our billion in senior unsecured debt would increase by basis points  which would increase our interest expense by million on an annual basis 
we are also subject to the risks of fluctuating hotel operating margins at our hotels  including but not limited to wage and benefit costs  repair and maintenance expenses  utilities  liability insurance  and other operating expenses that can fluctuate disproportionately to revenues 
these operating expenses are difficult to predict and control  resulting in an increased risk of volatility in our results of operations 
the economic slowdown and the sharp drop in occupancy and adr that began in  have resulted both in declines in revpar and an erosion in operating margins 
if the declines in hotel revpar and or operating margins worsen or continue for a protracted time  they could have a material adverse effect on our operations  earnings and cash flow 
on april   we completed the private placement of approximately million of our series b preferred stock 
these shares of preferred stock were issued at a discount to yield an effective rate of 
the proceeds were used for working capital  and allowed us to accelerate certain capital expenditures 
in august  we contributed five of our hotels held for sale to a joint venture in which one of our subsidiaries holds a equity interest  and a subsidiary of our joint venture partner holds the other equity interest 
an affiliate of our joint venture partner manages these hotels 
pursuant to the joint venture agreement  our joint venture partner contributed million to the new venture 
the venture closed on a million line of credit  of which approximately million was drawn at closing  with the cash proceeds going to us 
the remaining million under the line of credit is being used for capital improvements at the hotels 
in addition to our equity interest  we retained a preferred right to receive approximately million from the venture 
in  we entered into two amendments to our line of credit 
in june  we amended our line of credit to relax covenant levels to provide us with greater financial flexibility 
in december  we further amended our line of credit to relax covenant levels and to reduce capacity under the line to million from million 
the maturity of the line of credit remains at october   but we have the right to extend the maturity date for two consecutive one year periods  subject to certain conditions 
we recorded a million expense to write off unamortized deferred financing costs associated with the reduction in our line of credit 
although we were in compliance with our existing covenants prior to the amendments  it was necessary to amend the line of credit in anticipation of a continued negative revpar environment 
the amended line allows for the relaxation of certain financial covenants through the maturity date  with a step up in covenants on june   including the unsecured interest coverage  fixed charge coverage  secured leverage  and total leverage tests 
the interest rate remains on the same floating rate basis with a tiered spread based on our debt leverage ratio  but with an added tier to reflect the higher permitted leverage 
there was no amount outstanding under the facility at december  as of the date of this filing  we had million outstanding under our line of credit and cash and cash equivalents of approximately million 
the primary reason for the outstanding balance on our line of credit was our decision to carry excess cash because of the current geopolitical and economic uncertainties and their potential impact on our operating results 
in addition to financial covenants  our line of credit includes certain other affirmative and negative covenants  including restrictions on our ability to create or acquire wholly owned subsidiaries  restrictions on the operation ownership of our hotels  limitations on our ability to lease property or guarantee leases of other persons  limitations on our ability to make restricted payments such as distributions on common and preferred stock  share repurchases and certain investments  limitations on our ability to merge or consolidate with other persons to issue stock of our subsidiaries and to sell all or substantially all of our assets  restrictions on our ability to construct new hotels or acquire hotels under construction  limitations on our ability to change the nature of our business and limitations on our ability to modify certain instruments  to create liens  to enter into transactions with affiliates and limitations on our ability to enter into joint ventures 
under the most recent amendment to our line of credit  at higher permitted leverage levels we agreed to certain more stringent limitations on acquisitions  restricted payments and discretionary capital expenditures 
at december   we were in compliance with all of these covenants 
unless our business and cash flow stabilizes  we may not be able to satisfy the relaxed financial covenant requirements 
in such an event  we may need to obtain further amendments from our lenders under the line of credit to continue being able to borrow under it 
we are not certain whether  to what extent  or upon what terms the lenders may be willing to further relax the covenants 
further amendments to our line of credit may result in additional restrictions on us that  together with any limitation on our ability to borrow under the line  may adversely affect our ability to run our business and manage our financial affairs 
the breach of any of the covenants and limitations under our line of credit could result in the acceleration of amounts outstanding 
our failure to satisfy any accelerated indebtedness  if in the amount of million or more  could result in the acceleration of most of our other unsecured recourse indebtedness 
we may not be able to refinance or repay our debt in full under those circumstances 
our other borrowings contain affirmative and negative covenants that are generally equal to or less restrictive than the line of credit 
most of our mortgage debt is non recourse to us and contains provisions allowing for the substitution of collateral upon satisfaction of certain conditions 
most of our mortgage debt is prepayable  subject to various prepayment penalties  yield maintenance or defeasance obligations 
at december   we had unencumbered investments in hotels with a net book value totaling billion 
our publicly traded senior unsecured notes require that we satisfy a total leverage  a secured leverage and an interest coverage test in order to incur additional indebtedness  except under our line of credit or to refinance maturing debt with replacement debt  as defined under our indentures  to pay dividends in excess of the minimum dividend required to meet the reit qualification test  to repurchase stock  or to merge 
as of the date of this filing  we have satisfied all such incurrence tests 
we currently expect that we will have the flexibility to meet these tests unless revpar declines continue or become more severe 
we have debt maturing of million in and million in  including million of our senior unsecured notes that mature in october we anticipate meeting these obligations through a combination of cash on hand  cash flow from operations  borrowing under our line of credit  additional secured debt and sale of non strategic hotel assets 
we currently anticipate that we will meet our financial covenant and incurrence tests under the revpar guidance provided by us at our fourth quarter earnings conference call on february  for the first quarter of  we currently anticipate that our portfolio revpar will be to below the comparable period of the prior year 
ffo is expected to be within the range of to million for the first quarter of  and ebitda is expected to be within the range of million to million for the same period 
the revpar decline in  compared to the same periods in  was approximately for january  for february  and was for the first days of march 
we currently anticipate that full year hotel portfolio revpar will be approximately the same as  plus or minus 
ffo  for the year  is anticipated to be within the range of to million and ebitda is expected to be within the range of to million 
certain significant credit and debt statistics at december   and  are as follows consolidated debt to annual ebitda x x total debt to annual ebitda x x consolidated debt to investment in hotels  at cost consolidated debt to total market capitalization consolidated debt to assets ebitda to consolidated interest paid a x x ebitda to total interest expense b x x fixed charge coverage ratio c x x a ebitda to consolidated interest paid represents consolidated ebitda divided by interest expense before capitalized interest and amortization of debt costs 
b ebitda to total interest expense represents consolidated ebitda divided by interest expense  including our pro rata share of unconsolidated interest expense 
our interest coverage incurrence test under our senior unsecured notes allows the exclusion of certain unrestricted subsidiaries that are included in the consolidated numbers used to compute this ratio 
c fixed charge coverage ratio represents consolidated ebitda divided by consolidated interest expense  our pro rata share of unconsolidated interest expense and preferred dividends 
at december   we had o million of cash and cash equivalents  o no balance outstanding under our million line of credit  o fixed interest rate debt equal to of our total debt  o weighted average maturity of fixed interest rate debt of approximately six years  and o secured debt to total assets of the following details our debt outstanding at december   and in thousands december  collateral a interest rate maturity date floating rate debt line of credit none october  publicly traded term notes swapped none b october   publicly traded term notes swapped none b october  promissory note none june total floating rate debt c   fixed rate debt publicly traded term notes none october   publicly traded term notes none september   publicly traded term notes none june   mortgage debt hotels november   mortgage debt hotels april   mortgage debt hotels june   mortgage debt hotels may   mortgage debt hotels may   mortgage debt hotels   other hotel   total fixed rate debt c   total debt c   a at december   we had unencumbered investments in hotels with a net book value totaling billion 
b at december   our million in publicly traded notes due october  and million of our publicly traded notes due october  were matched with interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted the fixed interest rate on these notes to a floating interest rate tied to libor 
the differences to be paid or received by us under the terms of the interest rate swap agreements are accrued as interest rates change and are recognized as an adjustment to interest expense 
the interest rate swaps decreased our interest expense by million during c calculated based on the weighted average of outstanding debt at december  all of our floating rate debt at december   was based upon libor 
six month libor at december   was 
at december   we had million of publicly traded term notes due october  and million of publicly traded term notes due october  that were matched with interest rate swap agreements which effectively convert the fixed interest rate on these notes to a variable interest rate 
these interest rate swap agreements have maturity dates coinciding with the maturity dates of these publicly traded term notes 
we entered into seven separate interest rate swap agreements with three different financial institutions 
under these agreements  we receive a fixed rate of for the agreements maturing in october  and for the agreement maturing in october we pay the six month libor rate plus a spread ranging from to 
the weighted average spread over libor at december   was in january and february  we executed two additional interest rate swaps 
these new fair value swaps are similar to those that existed at december   they modify a portion of the interest characteristics of our outstanding fixed rate debt without an exchange of the underlying principal amount and effectively convert fixed rate debt to a variable rate 
as designated fair value hedges  these swaps will be marked to market through the income statement  but are offset by the change in fair value of our swapped outstanding fixed rate debt 
the notional amount of these new swaps is million  on which we receive a fixed rate of and pay a rate of libor plus an average spread of 
we spent approximately million on upgrading and renovating our hotels during the year ended december  our unconsolidated entities spent approximately million on upgrading and renovating hotels  and approximately million on a residential condominium development project  during the year ended december  notwithstanding the current significant economic downturn  we believe that our hotels will continue to benefit from our extensive capital expenditure programs in previous years 
we currently anticipate our capital expenditures to be between and million

the following schedule details these obligations and maturity dates at december  in thousands total amounts committed loan guarantee   investments in unconsolidated entities at december   we had unconsolidated investments in ventures that own an aggregate of hotels referred to as hotel joint ventures  and we had unconsolidated investments in ventures that operate of those hotels referred to as operating joint ventures

none of our directors  officers or employees owns any interest in any of these hotel or operating joint ventures 
the hotel ventures had approximately million of non recourse mortgage debt relating to of the hotels 
this debt is not reflected as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
the liability of our subsidiaries that are members or partners in these ventures is generally limited to the guarantee of the borrowing venture s personal obligations to pay for the lender s losses caused by misconduct  fraud or misappropriation of funds by the venture and other typical exceptions from the nonrecourse provisions in the mortgages  such as for environmental liabilities 
one hotel joint venture had a full recourse loan outstanding of million at december   that we guaranteed 
at december   we also had an unconsolidated investment in a venture that is developing a residential condominium project in myrtle beach  south carolina 
this joint venture has a million full recourse construction loan 
we and our joint venture partner  hilton  have each guaranteed of the amount outstanding under this loan 
at december   an aggregate of million had been drawn under this loan  of which we have guaranteed our pro rata share of million 
our pro rata share of the entire amount available under the construction loan is million 
the anticipated completion date of this development is late capital expenditures on the hotels owned by our hotel joint ventures are generally paid from the capital reserve account  which is funded from the income from operations of these ventures 
however  if a venture has insufficient cash to make necessary capital improvements  the venture may make a capital call upon the venture members or partners to fund such necessary improvements 
it is possible that  in the event of a capital call  the other joint venture member or partner may be unwilling or unable to make the necessary capital contributions 
under such circumstances  we may elect to make the other party s contribution as a loan to the venture or as an additional capital contribution by us 
under certain circumstances  a capital contribution by us may increase our investment equity to greater than and may require that we consolidate the venture  including all of its assets and liabilities  into our consolidated financial statements 
with respect to those ventures that are partnerships  any of our subsidiaries that serve as a general partner will be liable for all of the recourse obligations of the venture  to the extent that the venture does not have sufficient assets or insurance to satisfy the obligations 
in addition  the hotels owned by these ventures could perform below expectations and result in the insolvency of the ventures and the acceleration of their debts  unless the members or partners provide additional capital 
in some ventures  the members or partners may be required to make additional capital contributions or have their interest in the venture be reduced or offset for the benefit of any party making the required investment on their behalf 
in the foregoing and other circumstances  we may be faced with the choice of losing our investment in a venture or investing additional capital under circumstances that do not assure a return on that investment 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   approximately of our consolidated debt had fixed interest rates 
currently  market rates of interest are below the rates we are obligated to pay on our fixed rate debt 
the following tables provide information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including interest rate swaps and debt obligations 
for debt obligations  the tables present scheduled maturities and weighted average interest rates  by maturity dates 
for interest rate swaps  the tables present the notional amount and weighted average interest rate  by contractual maturity date 
the fair value of our fixed rate debt indicates the estimated principal amount of debt having the same debt service requirements that could have been borrowed at the date presented  at then current market interest rates 
the fair value of our variable to fixed interest rate swaps indicates the estimated amount that would have been received or paid by us had the swaps been terminated at the date presented 
expected maturity date at december  dollars in thousands thereafter total fair value liabilities fixed rate debt         interest rate swaps a    average interest rate floating rate debt interest rate swaps a     average interest rate b total        discount accretion  total debt  a at december   our million in publicly traded notes due october  and million of our publicly traded notes due october  were matched with interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted the fixed interest rate on these notes to a variable interest rate tied to libor 
the interest rate swap agreements also have maturities that coincide with those notes 
the differences to be paid or received by us under the terms of the interest rate swap agreements are accrued as interest rates change and are recognized as an adjustment to interest expense 
the interest rate swaps decreased our interest expense by million during b the average floating rate of interest represents the implied forward rates in the yield curve at december  expected maturity date at december  dollars in thousands thereafter total fair value liabilities fixed rate debt         interest rate swaps a   average interest rate floating rate debt    interest rate swaps   average interest rate a total        discount accretion  total debt  a the average floating rate of interest represents the implied forward rates in the yield curve at december  swap contracts  such as described above  contain a credit risk  in that the counterparties may be unable to fulfill the terms of the agreement 
we minimize that risk by evaluating the creditworthiness of our counterparties  who are limited to major banks and financial institutions  and we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties 
the credit ratings for the financial institutions that are counterparties to the interest rate swap agreements range from a to aa 
inflation operators of hotels  in general  possess the ability to adjust room rates daily to reflect the effects of inflation 
competitive pressures may  however  require us to reduce room rates in the near term and may limit our ability to raise room rates in the future 
seasonality the lodging business is seasonal in nature 
generally  hotel revenues are greater in the second and third calendar quarters than in the first and fourth calendar quarters  although this may not be true for hotels in major tourist destinations 
revenues for hotels in tourist areas generally are substantially greater during tourist season than other times of the year 
seasonal variations in revenue at our hotels can be expected to cause quarterly fluctuations in our revenues 
quarterly earnings also may be adversely affected by events beyond our control  such as extreme weather conditions  economic factors and other considerations affecting travel 
historically  to the extent that cash flow from operations has been insufficient during any quarter  due to temporary or seasonal fluctuations in revenues  we have utilized cash on hand or borrowings under our line of credit to make distributions to our equity holders 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  the carrying value of investments in hotels  litigation  and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
o we are required by gaap to record an impairment charge when we believe that an investment in one or more of our hotels has been impaired  such that future undiscounted cash flows would not recover the book basis  or net book value  of the investment 
we test for impairment when certain events occur  including one or more of the following projected cash flows are significantly less than recent historical cash flows  significant changes in legal factors or actions by a regulator that could affect the value of our hotels  events that could cause changes or uncertainty in travel patterns  and a current expectation that  more likely than not  a hotel will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
in february  we announced our plan to sell non strategic hotels over the next months 
the shorter probable holding periods related to our decision to sell these hotels was the primary factor that led to an impairment charge of million on of these hotels 
additional impairment charges of million were recorded in the fourth quarter of  resulting from decreased estimates of future cash flows from two hotels not included in our disposition plan 
we revised our estimates of future cash flows in the fourth quarter of  when it became apparent that the recovery of the travel industry would take longer than we had originally expected 
in the evaluation of impairment of our hotel assets  and in establishing the impairment charge  we made many assumptions and estimates on a hotel by hotel basis  which included the following o annual cash flow growth rates for revenues and expenses  o holding periods  o expected remaining useful lives of assets  o estimates in fair values taking into consideration future cash flows  capitalization rates  discount rates and comparable selling prices  and o future capital expenditures 
changes in these estimates  future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying hotels could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the hotels that may not be reflected in the hotel s current carrying value  thereby requiring additional impairment charges in the future 
o we own a interest in various real estate joint ventures reported under the equity method of accounting 
in accordance with gaap  we record an impairment of these equity method investments when they experience an other than temporary decline in value 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined that certain of our equity method investments had experienced an other than temporary decline in value  because a recovery of their value in excess of previously recorded book values was not expected to occur within the next year 
as such  we recorded a related impairment loss of million 
changes in our estimates or future adverse changes in the market conditions of the hotels owned by equity method investments could result in additional declines in value that could be considered other than temporary 
o we make estimates with respect to contingent liabilities for losses covered by insurance in accordance with fas  accounting for contingencies 
we record liabilities for self insured losses under our insurance programs when it becomes probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of our financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
in  we became self insured for the first  per occurrence  of our general liability claims with regard to of our hotels 
we review the adequacy of our reserves for our self insured claims on a regular basis 
our reserves are intended to cover the estimated ultimate uninsured liability for losses with respect to reported and unreported claims incurred as of the end of each accounting period 
these reserves represent estimates at a given accounting date  generally utilizing projections based on claims  historical settlement of claims and estimates of future costs to settle claims 
estimates are also required since there may be reporting lags between the occurrence of the insured event and the time it is actually reported 
because establishment of insurance reserves is an inherently uncertain process involving estimates  currently established reserves may not be sufficient 
if our insurance reserves of million  at december   for general liability losses are insufficient  we will record an additional expense in future periods 
property and catastrophic losses are event driven losses and  as such  until a loss occurs and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated  no liability is recorded 
we have recorded no contingent liabilities with regard to property or catastrophic losses at december  o credit is extended to hotel guests  and terms of credit range from one day for the clearing of credit card receivables to days for corporate accounts 
we make estimates with respect to the collectability of our trade receivables and provide an allowance for doubtful accounts for our estimate of probable losses 
our estimate of losses is based on several factors  including historical losses  the aging of the outstanding receivables  and the financial condition of the customers 
if a customer becomes insolvent or files for bankruptcy  we charge off the entire amount due from that customer 
at both december  and  we had an allowance for doubtful accounts of million and had recorded bad debt expense of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
no bad debt expense was recorded during the year ended december   as this period was prior to our purchase of the hotel leases 
significant judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing allowances in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our allowances for any period if adverse economic conditions cause widespread financial difficulties among our customers  in general 
specifically  additional bankruptcies of other companies in the travel industry  such as airlines  may result in additional charges to bad debt expense 
o sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments 
in accordance with this pronouncement  all of our interest rate swap agreements outstanding at december   were designated as fair value hedges because they are hedging our exposure to the changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt 
our swaps meet the criteria necessary to assume no ineffectiveness of the hedge 
these instruments are marked to our estimate of their fair market value through the income statement  but are offset by the change in the estimated fair value of our swapped fixed rate debt 
we estimate the fair value of our interest rate swaps and fixed rate debt through the use of a third party valuation 
we may use other methods and assumptions to validate the fair market value 
at december   our estimate of the fair market value of the interest rate swaps was approximately million and represents the amount that we estimate we would currently receive upon termination of these instruments  based on current market rates and reasonable assumptions about relevant future market conditions 
o our trss have cumulative future tax deductions totaling million 
the gross deferred income tax asset associated with these future tax deductions was million 
we have recorded a valuation allowance equal to of our million deferred tax asset related to our trss  because of the uncertainty of realizing the benefit of the deferred tax asset 
sfas  accounting for income taxes  establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
in accordance with sfas we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase operating income in the period such determination was made 
recent accounting announcements during the year ended december   we elected early adoption of the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statement no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
sfas  among other things  rescinds sfas  which required that gains and losses from extinguishments of debt be classified as an extraordinary item  net of related income tax effects 
we have reclassified all losses from extinguishment of debt reported in prior periods to be included in income before equity in income of unconsolidated entities  minority interests and gain on sale of assets in the accompanying financial statements to conform to sfas the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued sfas no 
 accounting for exit or disposal activities 
sfas addresses significant issues regarding the recognition  measurement  and reporting of costs that are associated with exit and disposal activities  including restructuring activities that are currently accounted for pursuant to the guidance that the emerging issues task force eitf of the fasb  has set forth in eitf issue no  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the scope of sfas also included costs related to terminating a contract that is not a capital lease and termination benefits that employees who are involuntarily terminated receive under the terms of a one time benefit arrangement that is not an ongoing benefit arrangement or an individual deferred compensation contract 
sfas will be effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  we do not currently expect sfas to have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
the fasb has issued sfas no 
 acquisitions of certain financial institutions  which is effective for certain transactions arising on or after october  sfas will have no impact on us 
the fasb has issued sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to a fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
we have adopted the disclosure requirements of sfas the company currently accounts for stock based employee compensation in accordance with apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
in accordance with one of the alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to a fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation mandated by sfas  we intend to adopt the prospective method as of january  under this method  compensation expense will be recognized for any new awards issued after december  we do not currently expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations
