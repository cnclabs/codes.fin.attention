item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of the company included elsewhere in this form k 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under cautionary note regarding forward looking statements and risk factors in this section 
critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america necessarily requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reported period 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the accounting policies that the company believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating reported financial results include the following revenue recognition sales are recognized upon purchase by customers at the company s retail store locations or through the company s website 
the company has recorded reserves of 
million to estimate sales returns by customers based on historical sales return results 
actual return rates have historically been within management s expectations and the reserves established 
however  in the unlikely event that the actual rate of sales returns by customers increased significantly  the company s operational results could be adversely affected 
inventory valuation merchandise inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
cost is determined using the retail inventory method 
at any one time  inventories include items that have been marked down to management s best estimate of their fair market value 
management bases the decision to mark down merchandise upon the age of the item and its current rate of sale 
to the extent that management estimates differ from actual results  additional markdowns may have to be recorded  which could reduce the company s gross margins and operating results 
long lived assets in the normal course of business  the company acquires tangible and intangible assets 
the company periodically evaluates the recoverability of the carrying amount of its long lived assets including property  plant and equipment  and other intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
an impairment is assessed when the undiscounted expected future cash flows derived from an asset or asset group are less than its carrying amount 
impairments are recognized in operating earnings 
the company uses its best judgment based on the most current facts and circumstances surrounding its business when applying these impairment rules to determine the timing of the impairment test  the undiscounted cash flows used to assess impairments  and the fair value of a potentially impaired asset 
changes in assumptions used could have a significant impact on the company s assessment of recoverability 
numerous factors  including changes in the company s business  industry segment  and global economy  could significantly impact management s decision to retain  dispose of  or idle certain of its long lived assets 
goodwill and other intangible assets the company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill at least annually based on a two step impairment test 
the first step compares the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount exceeds fair value  then the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of any impairment loss 
fair value is determined based on estimated future cash flows  discounted at a rate that approximates the company s cost of capital 
such estimates are subject to change and the company may be required to recognize impairment losses in the future 

table of contents income taxes current income tax expense is the amount of income taxes expected to be payable for the current year 
a deferred income tax asset or liability is established for the expected future consequences of temporary differences in the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the company considers future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning in assessing the value of its deferred tax assets 
if the company determines that it is more likely than not that these assets will not be realized  the company would reduce the value of these assets to their expected realizable value  thereby decreasing net income 
evaluating the value of these assets is necessarily based on the company s judgment 
if the company subsequently determined that the deferred tax assets  which had been written down  would be realized in the future  the value of the deferred tax assets would be increased  thereby increasing net income in the period when that determination was made 
corporate rent reserve during fiscal  the company recorded a million charge to accrue for rent expense associated with the company s former corporate offices  which remain unused at the end of fiscal the current accrual at march  of million is approximately the amount of rent expense for one year  within which time the company currently believes a tenant will be identified to sublease the premises 
to the extent management s estimate relating to the company s ability to sublease these premises within one year changes  additional charges may be recorded in the future up to the net remaining obligation under the lease depending on the facts and circumstances in existence at the time 
as of february   the aggregate net remaining obligation under this lease was approximately million 
litigation the company is involved from time to time in litigation incidental to its business 
management believes that the outcome of current litigation will not have a material adverse effect upon the results of operations or financial condition of the company and  from time to time  may make provisions for potential litigation losses 
depending on the actual outcome of pending litigation  charges in excess of any provisions could be recorded in the future that may have an adverse effect on the company s operating results see note to the consolidated financial statements

expansion and management of growth 
pacsun s continued growth depends to a significant degree on its ability to open and operate stores on a profitable basis and on management s ability to manage the company s planned expansion 
during fiscal  the company plans to open approximately net new stores  of which approximately will be pacsun stores  approximately four will be pacsun outlet stores and approximately ten will be demo stores 
the company s planned expansion is dependent upon a number of factors  including the ability of the company to locate and obtain favorable store sites  negotiate acceptable lease terms  obtain adequate supplies of merchandise and hire and train qualified management level and other employees 
factors beyond the company s control may also affect the company s ability to expand  including general economic and business conditions affecting consumer spending

stores in the demo format 
comparable store net sales results for demo stores did not meet management s expectations during the first half of fiscal 
or during fiscal 
although comparable store net sales results improved significantly for demo stores during the second half of fiscal  the company is not certain that demo stores will achieve acceptable levels of sales or profitability in the future 
negative comparable store net sales results for demo stores may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations and may result in a greater number of store closings 
internet sales 
the company s internet operations are subject to numerous risks  including unanticipated operating problems  reliance on third party computer hardware and software providers  system failures and the need to invest in additional computer systems 
there can be no assurance that the internet operations will achieve sales and profitability levels that justify the company s investment therein

economic impact of terrorist attacks or war threat of war 
the majority of the company s stores are located in regional shopping malls 
in response to the terrorist attacks of september   security has been heightened in public areas 
any further threat of terrorist attacks or actual terrorist events  particularly in public areas  could lead to lower customer traffic in regional shopping malls 
in addition  local authorities or mall management could close regional shopping malls in response to any immediate security concern 
for example  on september   a substantial number of the company s stores were closed early due to closure of the malls in response to the terrorist attacks 
mall closures  as well as lower customer traffic due to security concerns  could result in decreased sales 
additionally  war or the threat of war could significantly diminish consumer spending  resulting in decreased sales for the company 
decreased sales would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
reliance on foreign sources of production 
the company purchases merchandise directly in foreign markets for its private label brands 
in addition  the company purchases merchandise from domestic vendors  some of which is manufactured overseas 
the company does not have any long term merchandise supply contracts and its imports are subject to existing or potential duties  tariffs and quotas 
the company faces competition from other companies for production facilities and import quota capacity 
the company also faces a variety of other risks generally associated with doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from abroad  such as i political instability  ii imposition of new legislation relating to import quotas that may limit the quantity of goods which may be imported into the united states from countries in a region that the company does business  iii imposition of duties  taxes  and other charges on imports  and iv local business practice and political issues  including issues relating to compliance with domestic or international labor standards which may result in adverse publicity 
new initiatives may be proposed that may have an impact on the trading status of certain countries and may include retaliatory duties or other trade sanctions which  if enacted  would increase the cost of products purchased from suppliers in countries that the company does business with 
the inability of the company to rely on its foreign sources of production due to any of the factors listed above could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
credit facility financial covenants 
a significant decrease in the company s operating results could adversely affect the company s ability to maintain required financial ratios under the company s credit facility 
required financial ratios include total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio  limitations on capital expenditures and achievement of certain rolling four quarter ebitda requirements 
if these financial ratios are not maintained  the bank will have the option to require immediate repayment of all amounts outstanding under the credit facility 
the most likely result would require the company to either renegotiate certain terms of the credit agreement  obtain a waiver from the bank  or obtain a new credit agreement with another bank  which may contain different terms 
stock options 
a number of publicly traded companies have recently announced that they will begin expensing stock option grants to employees 
in addition  the fasb and the commission have indicated that possible rule changes requiring expensing of stock options may be adopted in the near future 
currently  the company includes such expenses on a pro forma basis in the notes to the company s annual financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america but does not include stock option expenses in the company s reported financial statements 
if accounting standards are changed to require the company to expense stock options  the company s reported earnings will decrease and its stock price could decline

management believes that the outcome of current litigation will not have a material adverse effect upon the results of operations or financial condition of the company 
however  management s assessment of the 
table of contents company s current litigation could change in light of the discovery of facts with respect to legal actions pending against the company not presently known to the company or determinations by judges  juries or other finders of fact which do not accord with management s evaluation of the possible liability or outcome of such litigation
