total earnings 
net earnings after tax increased to a profit of million for from a loss of million for this increase in net earnings is due to increases in insurance and real estate income 
another reason for the increase is a reduction in rescission expenses in as compared to liquidity and capital resources the company historically has met its cash requirements and financed its growth principally through cash flows generated from operations 
during the past decade  the company has operated in a soft market cycle which was characterized by excess insurance capacity and declining insurance premium rates  however  commencing in fiscal year the company has operated in a hardening market with increased insurance premium rates for workers compensation and excess and surplus lines 
the company s primary sources of cash flow are proceeds from the sale or maturity of invested assets  premiums written  investment income  income from real estate development sales  commission income  management fees and reinsurance recoverables from reinsurers 
the company s short term cash requirements are primarily for claims payments  reinsurance premiums  commissions  salaries  employee benefits  real estate development expenses  other operating expenses  and the purchase of investment securities  which have historically been satisfied from operating cash flows 
due to the uncertainty regarding settlement of unpaid claims  the long term liquidity requirements of the company may vary  and the company has attempted to structure its investment portfolio to take into account the historical payout patterns 
the company also purchases reinsurance to mitigate the effect of large claims and to help stabilize demands on its liquidity 
notwithstanding the company s dispute with one of its former reinsurers  berkley insurance company  as described in item of this report  management believes that the company s current cash flows are sufficient for the short term needs of its insurance business and the company s invested assets are sufficient for the long term needs of its insurance business 
as discussed in item legal proceedings  the company has a pending material dispute with berkley insurance company  one of the company s former reinsurers  with respect to unreimbursed paid claims under treaties totaling million and additional ceded case reserves and reserves for incurred but not reported losses totaling approximately million as of december  the company recognized a million expense in for reinsurance recoverables relating to the berkley dispute as a result of a settlement offer made by the company 
the company does not believe this dispute will have a material adverse effect on the overall financial condition or liquidity of the company as management believes the company has sufficient current cash flows and invested assets to meet its insurance obligations 
however  due to the fact that the final decision rests in the hands of an arbitration panel  it is uncertain whether the panel s decision will be on terms favorable to the company 
on a consolidated basis  net cash provided from operations was million for the twelve months ended december  and million as of december  the positive cash flows for said periods were primarily attributable to net premiums written  net earnings and sales of real estate 
because workers compensation and general liability claims may be paid over an extended period of time  the company has established loss reserves for such lines of business 
the assets supporting the company s reserves continue to earn investment income until claims payments are made 
total assets increased from million at december  to million at december  primarily due to increases in invested assets  cash and reinsurance recoverables 
cash  invested assets and notes receivable increased from million at december  to million at december   as a result of increases in fixed maturities and cash 
at december   the company has repurchased  shares of its common stock at a total cost of million since january american safety is an insurance holding company whose principal assets are its investment portfolio and its investment in the capital stock of its subsidiaries 
american safety s ability to pay dividends to its shareholders will depend  to a significant degree  on the ability of the company s subsidiaries to generate earnings from which to pay dividends to american safety 
the jurisdictions in which american safety and its insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are domiciled place limitations on the amount of dividends or other distributions payable by insurance companies in order to protect the solvency of insurers 
management has planned that the harbour village project would be developed in three phases with projected completion in through december   the company had outstanding borrowings of million from an initial million development and construction loan facility 
the estimated completion cost for the remainder of the harbour village project was approximately million at december  see item legal proceedings with respect to the settlement of material zoning litigation involving the harbour village project

critical accounting policies the accounting policies described below are those the company considers critical in preparing its financial statements 
these policies include significant estimates made by management using information available at the time the estimates are made 
however  as described below  these estimates could change materially if different information or assumptions were used 
the descriptions below are summarized and have been simplified for clarity 
a more detailed description of the significant accounting policies used by the company in preparing its financial statements is included in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
reinsurance 
one of the company s former reinsurers  berkley insurance company  has disputed its obligations under several reinsurance treaties entered into during the soft reinsurance market that existed in and as of december   unreimbursed paid claims totaled million and additional ceded case and incurred but not reported reserves totaled approximately million 
a reserve of million for this dispute has been established because of the conditions set forth in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
if any of these factors change in the future  the company may have to establish additional reserves at that time  which could be material 
see item legal proceedings for a discussion of the company s pending material reinsurance recoverables dispute with berkley insurance company  one of the company s former reinsurers 
unpaid losses loss adjustment expenses 
the company is required to estimate its liability for loss and loss adjustment expenses 
the estimated liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses recorded on the company s balance sheet at the end of any given period should be adequate to cover all future payments required to be made on account of insured events that occurred on or before the balance sheet date 
however  because the future cannot be predicted with certainty  the actual future payments are usually different from the previously recorded estimates  and sometimes the differences may be material 
these differences are included in the company s results of operations in the future periods in which they become known 
deferred income taxes 
the company is required to establish a valuation allowance for the portion of any deferred tax asset  which amounted to million at december   that management believes will not be realized 
the company believes that it is more likely than not that the company will realize the full benefit of its deferred tax assets in future periods 
accordingly  no valuation allowance has been established 
construction accounting 
the company recognizes revenue on harbour village  its real estate development project  when title to each condominium unit and boat slip transfers to the purchaser 
when title transfers  the company uses a percentage of completion method based on actual costs to total estimated costs including allocated common costs to recognize revenue 
the estimated future common costs of amenities at december  were million  of which  related to condominium units that were closed in the percentage of completion method is based upon future estimated costs  and actual costs may vary greatly from these estimated costs requiring an adjustment to be recorded in future periods 
income taxes american safety is incorporated under the laws of bermuda and  under current bermuda law  is not obligated to pay any taxes in bermuda based upon income or capital gains 
american safety has received an undertaking from the minister of finance in bermuda pursuant to the provisions of the exempted undertakings tax protection act  which exempts american safety and its shareholders  other than shareholders ordinarily resident in bermuda  from any bermuda taxes computed on profits  income or any capital asset  gain or appreciation  or any tax in the nature of estate  duty or inheritance until march  the company  exclusive of its united states subsidiaries  does not consider itself to be engaged in a trade or business in the united states and accordingly does not expect to be subject to direct united states income taxation 
the company s us subsidiaries are subject to taxation in the united states 
impact of inflation property and casualty insurance premiums are established before the amounts of losses and loss adjustment expenses are known and therefore before the extent by which inflation may affect such expenses is known 
consequently  the company attempts  in establishing its premiums  to anticipate the potential impact of inflation 
however  for competitive and regulatory reasons  the company may be limited in raising its premiums consistent with anticipated inflation  in which event the company  rather than its insureds  would absorb inflation costs 
inflation also affects the rate of investment return on the company s investment portfolio with a corresponding effect on the company s investment income 
combined ratio the combined ratio of an insurance company measures only the underwriting results of insurance operations and not the profitability of the overall company 
the company s reported combined ratio for its insurance operations may not provide an accurate indication of the company s overall profitability from insurance and reinsurance programs due to the exclusion of fee and commission income and expenses generated in related management and agency subsidiaries 
depending on the company s mix of business going forward  the combined ratio may fluctuate from time to time and may not reflect the overall profitability of the company s insurance and reinsurance programs 
reserves certain of the company s insurance policies and reinsurance assumed  including general and pollution liability policies covering environmental remediation  excess and surplus  and workers compensation risks  may be subject to claims brought years after an incident has occurred or the policy period has ended 
the company is required to maintain reserves to cover its estimated liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to reported and unreported claims incurred 
the company engages an independent internationally recognized actuarial consulting firm to provide reserve studies  rate studies  and opinions 
reserves are estimates at a given time  which are established from actuarial and statistical projections by the company of the ultimate settlement and administration costs of claims occurring on or prior to such time  including claims that have not yet been reported to the insurer 
the establishment of appropriate loss reserves is an inherently uncertain process  and there can be no assurance that the ultimate payments will not materially exceed the company s reserves

interest rate risk the company s fixed maturity investments and borrowings are subject to interest rate risk 
increases and decreases in interest rates typically result in decreases and increases in the fair value of these financial instruments 
approximately three quarters of the company s investable assets come from premiums paid by policyholders 
these funds are invested predominantly in high quality corporate  government and municipal bonds with relatively short durations 
the fixed maturity portfolio is exposed to interest rate fluctuations  as interest rates rise  their fair values decline and as interest rates fall  the fair value of the fixed maturity portfolio rises 
the changes in the fair market value of the fixed maturity portfolio are presented as a component of shareholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income  net of taxes 
the company works to manage the impact of interest rate fluctuations on its fixed maturity portfolio 
the effective duration of the fixed maturity portfolio is managed with consideration given to the estimated duration of the company s liabilities 
the company has investment policies which limit the maximum duration and maturity of the fixed maturity portfolio
