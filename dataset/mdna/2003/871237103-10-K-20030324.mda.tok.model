these offshore operations represented over of consolidated revenues for compared to for  exclusive of us fulfillment and distribution operations 
as our offshore business grows and becomes a larger percentage of revenues  the total revenue and revenue growth rate may decline since the average revenue per seat generated offshore is less than it is in the united states and europe 
although the average offshore revenue per seat is less than it is in the united states and europe  the lower average revenue is somewhat offset by higher operating margins in the offshore operations 
the decrease in emea s revenue of million  or  for was primarily related to the loss of a dot

net income loss per basic and diluted share are computed independently for each of the quarters presented and therefore may not sum to the total for the year 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated by operating activities and from available borrowings under our credit facilities 
we have utilized our capital resources to make capital expenditures associated primarily with our technical and customer support services  invest in technology applications and tools to further develop our service offerings and for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
in future periods  we intend similar uses of these funds 
during the fourth quarter of  we paid million for the million uninsured portion of the class action litigation settlement and will pay approximately million to million which has been accrued for in through the first half of in connection with the restructuring plan to close and consolidate several customer support centers in the united states and europe 
we may also use capital resources to fund possible acquisitions and repurchase common stock in the open market 
on august   we announced that our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to three million shares of our outstanding common stock 
the shares of common stock will be purchased  from time to time  through open market purchases or in negotiated private transactions  and the purchases will be based on factors such as  including but not limited to  the stock price and general market conditions 
the amendment to our revolving credit facility  which was effective as of september  see note long term debt  limits the dollar amount of stock that we may repurchase to no more than million and the amount of cash we may spend in making acquisitions 
at december   we have repurchased  common shares under the repurchase program at prices ranging from to per share for a total cost of million 
in  we generated million in cash from operating activities  million in funds from the sale of facilities  property and equipment and million in funds from issuance of stock to provide a million increase in available cash net of the effects of international currency exchange rates on cash of million  used million in funds for investments in capital expenditures and million for acquisition of intangible assets and purchased million of stock in the open market

the net decrease in assets and liabilities of million was due to a million decrease in receivables primarily due to a decrease in revenues and concentrated efforts to reduce trade days sales outstanding  a decrease of million in other assets offset by an increase in income taxes receivable of million primarily due to increases in refunds due on carry back of net operating losses  an increase in deferred revenue of million and an increase in accounts payable and other accrued accounts of million 
capital expenditures  which are generally funded by cash generated from operating activities and borrowings available under our credit facilities  were million for compared to million for  a decline of million 
in  approximately of the capital expenditures were the result of investing in new and existing customer support centers  primarily offshore  and was expended primarily for systems infrastructure 
in  we anticipate capital expenditures in the range of million to million 
the primary sources of cash flows from financing activities are from borrowings under our credit facility 
we amended our revolving credit facility with a group of lenders the amended credit facility  effective as of september   as a result of a million charge for the uninsured portion of the class action litigation settlement in the third quarter of see note commitments and contingencies 
according to the terms of the amended credit facility  the amount of the revolving credit facility was reduced  at our request  from million to a maximum of million  subject to certain borrowing limitations 
the million revolving credit facility includes a million swingline subfacility  a million letter of credit subfacility and a million multi currency subfacility 
borrowings under the amended credit facility are restricted to of eligible accounts receivable 
terms of the amendment increased the interest rate basis points to basis points depending on debt levels  reduced the maximum judgment limitation to million previously million and other unsecured indebtedness to million previously million  required cash and cash equivalents of million and minimum eligible accounts receivable of million and further limited certain investments and capital expenditures 
the amended credit facility  which includes certain financial covenants  may be used to provide for working capital and general corporate purposes and to fund future acquisitions 
the amended credit facility accrues interest  at our option  at a the lender s base rate plus an applicable margin up to  b the london interbank offered rate libor plus an applicable margin up to  or c the interbank offered rate ibor plus an applicable margin up to  that varies with our debt levels and certain financial ratios 
in addition  a commitment fee of up to is charged on the unused portion of the amended credit facility on a quarterly basis 
the borrowings under the amended credit facility  which terminates may   are guaranteed by a pledge of all of the common stock of each of our material domestic subsidiaries and of the stock of each of our material direct foreign subsidiaries 
the amended credit facility prohibits  without the consent of the lenders  sykes from incurring additional indebtedness  limits certain investment advances or loans and restricts substantial asset sales  capital expenditures  stock repurchases and dividends 
there were no outstanding balances on the amended credit facility as of december  at december   we were in compliance with all loan requirements of the amended credit facility 
at december   we had million in cash and approximately million of availability under the amended credit facility 
approximately million of our cash balances at december  were held in international operations and may be subject to additional taxes if repatriated to the united states 
we believe that our current cash levels  accessible funds under our credit facilities and cash flows from future operations will be adequate to meet anticipated working capital needs  future debt repayment requirements if any  continued expansion objectives and anticipated levels of capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
the following summarizes our contractual cash obligations at december   and the effect these obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years after years contractual cash obligations capital lease obligations operating leases unconditional purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations at december  and  we did not have any other material commercial commitments  including guarantees or standby repurchase obligations  or any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  including entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires estimations and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical since these policies require significant judgment or involve complex estimations that are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results we recognize revenue associated with the grants of land and the grants for the acquisition of property  buildings and equipment for customer support centers over the corresponding useful lives of the related assets 
should the useful lives of these assets change for reasons such as the sale or disposal of the property  the amount of revenue recognized would be adjusted accordingly 
deferred grants totaled million as of december  we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts of million as of december   or of receivables  for estimated losses arising from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in a reduced ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required which would reduce income 
we maintain valuation allowances of million as of december   or of deferred tax assets  for the amount of deferred tax assets that is more likely than not to be recognized 
while we consider taxable income in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  in the event we determine we would be able to realize the deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment would be made and income increased in the period of such determination 
likewise  in the event we determine we would not be able to realize all or part of the deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment would be made and charged against income in the period of such determination 
we hold a minority interest in shps  incorporated as a result of the sale of a ownership interest in june  that we account for at cost which was million as of december  we would record an impairment charge or loss if we believe the investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the underlying investment could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment  and therefore  might require an impairment charge in the future 
we review long lived assets  which had a carrying value of million as of december   including goodwill and property and equipment  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
upon our determination that the carrying value of the asset is impaired  we would record an impairment charge or loss 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the underlying investment could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment  and therefore  might require an impairment charge in the future 
self insurance related liabilities of million as of december  include estimates for  among other things  projected settlements for known and anticipated claims for worker s compensation and employee health insurance 
key variables in determining such estimates include past claims history  number of covered employees and projected future claims 
we periodically evaluate and  if necessary  adjust the estimates based on information currently available 
revisions to these estimates  which could result in adjustments to the liability and additional charges  would be recorded in the period when these adjustments or charges are known 
related party transactions during  we terminated a ten year operating lease agreement with our chairman and majority shareholder for the corporate aircraft and paid a lease termination fee of million 
this lease termination payment is included in restructuring and other charges in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  since the lease termination  we paid the chairman and majority shareholder million  million and million for the use of the corporate aircraft in  and  respectively

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency and interest rate risk our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in non us currency exchange rates 
we are exposed to non us exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of non us subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  those results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
the cumulative translation effects for subsidiaries using functional currencies other than the us dollar are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders equity 
movements in non us currency exchange rates may affect our competitive position  as exchange rate changes may affect business practices and or pricing strategies of non us based competitors 
under our current policy  we do not use non us exchange derivative instruments to manage exposure to changes in non us currency exchange rates 
during  we had no debt outstanding at variable interest rates 
we have not historically used derivative instruments to manage exposure to changes in interest rates
