such assumptions may not materialize to the extent assumed  and such risks and uncertainties may cause actual results to differ from anticipated results

critical accounting policies the sec issued statements regarding disclosure by companies within their management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in those statements  the sec encouraged companies to identify critical accounting policies 
critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results  and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
in response to the sec statements  management has identified the following critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements and accompanying notes 
revenue recognition and deferred contract revenue the company recognizes revenues and the related costs for its services in the periods for which such services are provided 
many customers pay for these services in advance 
the amounts recorded as deferred contract revenue in the consolidated balance sheet represent customer deposits invoiced in advance during the preceding twelve months for services rendered over the succeeding twelve months  and are net of services rendered through the respective consolidated balance sheet date 
such advance billings amounted to  and  respectively  as of september  and september   are included in deferred contract revenue  and are stated net of services rendered through the respective consolidated balance sheet dates 
management believes that the amount of deferred revenue shown at the respective consolidated balance sheet dates fairly represents the level of business activity it expects to conduct with customers invoiced under this arrangement 
allowance for doubtful accounts management judgments and estimates are utilized in connection with establishing an allowance for the possibility that portions of the company s accounts receivable balances may become uncollectible 
specifically  management analyzes accounts in relation to receivable aging trends  economic factors  and changes in customer payment history in establishing this allowance 
accounts receivable reduced by this allowance of  as of september  and  as of september   amounted to  and  respectively  as of september  and september  property  plant equipment plant and equipment including dosimetry badges and software are recorded at cost and are depreciated amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives  which are primarily thirty years for buildings and three to eight years for equipment 
landauer assesses the carrying value of its property  plant and equipment and the remaining useful lives whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable or the estimated useful life may no longer be appropriate 
factors considered important which could trigger this review included competitive conditions  government regulations and technological changes 
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense  and renewals and betterments are capitalized 
landauer capitalizes internal software costs in accordance with sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
goodwill and other intangible assets the company s intangible assets are comprised of goodwill  purchased customer lists  licenses and patents 
on october   the company adopted sfas no 
which requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets no longer be amortized to earnings  but be reviewed periodically for impairment 
for acquisitions completed prior to june   the amortization of goodwill and certain intangible assets has ceased beginning in fiscal year under sfas no 
 the impairment review of goodwill and other intangible assets that are not being amortized must be based generally on fair values 
as a result of applying the impairment provisions of sfas no 
 no impairment loss was required 
purchased customer lists are recorded at cost and are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives  which are primarily ten years 
patents and licenses are also recorded at cost and are amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives  which range from to years 
other assets are reviewed for impairment whenever circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist 
such review is based on estimates of future undiscounted cash flows and an assessment of fair value based on discounted cash flows or other indicators of fair market value 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk significant risk factors the company s business and operations are subject to certain risks and uncertainties  including foreign currency exchange and interest rate risks the company is exposed to market risk  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
as discussed in note to the financial statements in this annual report on form k  summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements  the financial statements of the company s non us subsidiaries are remeasured into us dollars using the us dollar as the functional currency 
to date  the market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rates has not been material in relation to the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
these risks could increase  however  as the company expands in international markets 
the company does not have any significant trade accounts receivable  trade accounts payable  commitments or borrowings in a currency other than that of the reporting units functional currencies 
as such  the company does not currently use derivative financial instruments to manage the exposure in its non us operations 
reliance upon single manufacturing facility landauer  inc conducts its primary manufacturing and laboratory processing operations from a single facility in glenwood  il 
in addition  the company performs significant functions for some of its international joint ventures from the glenwood facility 
if the company were to lose availability of its primary facility due to fire  natural disaster or other disruptions  the company s operations could be significantly impaired 
although the company maintains business interruption insurance  there can be no assurance that the proceeds of such insurance would be sufficient to offset any loss the company might incur or that the company would be able to retain its customer base if operations were so disrupted 
single source for crystal materials crystal material is a key component in landauer s osl technology 
the company operates a single crystal manufacturing facility in stillwater  oklahoma that currently supplies all crystal material used by the company 
if the company were to lose availability of its stillwater facility due to a fire  natural disaster or other disruptions  such loss could have a material adverse effect on the company and its operations 
prior to acquiring the stillwater facility  the company purchased the majority of its raw crystal material from one external source 
there can be no assurance that the company could secure additional crystal raw materials from external sources in the event of a disruption at the stillwater facility 
technology landauer s technological expertise has been an important factor in its growth 
the company regularly pursues product improvements to maintain its technical position 
the development and introduction of new technologies  the adaptability of osl to new platforms and new formats  the usefulness of older technologies as well as the introduction of new technologies by the competition present various risks to the company s business 
the failure or lack of market acceptance of a new technology or the inability to respond to market requirements for new technology could adversely affect the company s operations or reputation with customers 
the cancellation of technology projects or the cessation of use of an existing technology can result in impairments and charges to the company s earnings 
in the normal course of its business  landauer must record and process significant amounts of data quickly and accurately and relies on various computer and telecommunications equipment and software systems 
any failure of such equipment or systems could adversely affect the company s operations 
international operations pose risks landauer conducts business in numerous international markets such as japan  france  the united kingdom  brazil  canada  china  and others 
foreign operations are subject to a number of special risks  including among others  currency exchange rate fluctuations  disruption in relations  political and economic unrest  trade barriers  exchange controls  expropriation  and changes in laws and policies  including those governing foreign owned operations 
government regulations regulation  present and future  is a constant factor affecting the company s business 
the radiation monitoring industry is subject to federal and state governmental regulation 
unknown matters  new laws and regulations  or stricter interpretations of existing law or regulations may materially affect landauer s business or operations in the future and or could increase the cost of compliance 
competition the company competes on the basis of advanced technologies  competent execution of these technologies  the quality  reliability and price of its services and its prompt and responsive performance 
in much of the world  radiation monitoring activities are conducted by a combination of private entities and governmental agencies 
the company s primary competitor in the united states is large and has substantial resources 
this entity recently came under new ownership and the company is currently evaluating the impact  if any  of the change in ownership on this competitor 
the company also faces competitive pressures from a number of smaller competitors
