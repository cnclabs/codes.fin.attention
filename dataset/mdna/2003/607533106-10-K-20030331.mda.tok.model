table of contents application of critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during a reporting period 
actual results can differ from those estimates and it is possible that the differences could be material 
we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the accuracy of the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  accounting for restructuring liabilities  accounting for income taxes  valuation of long lived assets  investments and goodwill  and lease guarantees 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues as services are rendered in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab no 

a majority of our revenues are derived from fixed bid and retainer based assignments 
unbilled revenues represent labor costs incurred and estimated earnings in excess of billings and production and other client reimbursable out of pocket costs incurred in excess of billings 
amounts billed to clients in excess of revenues recognized to date are classified as deferred revenues 
our clients hire us on a fixed bid  retainer or time and materials basis 
we reassess our estimated costs on fixed bid engagements periodically and  as needed for specific engagements  losses are accrued to the extent that costs incurred and anticipated costs to complete engagements exceed total anticipated billings 
provisions for losses on uncompleted fixed bid contracts  if any  are recognized in the period in which such losses are determined 
out of pocket and other pass through expenses are recognized as revenue in the period incurred 
allowance for doubtful accounts we assess the required amount of allowance for doubtful accounts based on past experience and the review of the aging and analysis of specific accounts 
accounting for restructuring liabilities restructuring charges include the costs associated with our restructuring actions taken in the periods presented 
charges were recorded at the time the decision was made and plans were approved to restructure operations 
the charges consisted of actual and estimated costs that were incremental to our ongoing operations and were incurred to close offices  reduce excess office facilities and equipment  and terminate employees 
due to the continuing high level of available office space and lack of demand in the san francisco  norwalk and london real estate markets  management determined that expected lease terms are significantly less favorable than the original assumptions and will not improve in the foreseeable future 
the liability is equal to the future minimum lease payments under contractual obligations offset by estimated future sublease payments 
in determining these estimates  we evaluated our potential to sublease our excess space and our ability to renegotiate various leases at more favorable terms and in some instances obtain relief through relocation of office space 
these sublease estimates  which were made in connection with our real estate advisers  are based on 
table of contents current and projected conditions in the real estate and economic markets in which we have excess office space 
if actual market conditions are more or less favorable than those we have projected  we may be required to record or reverse restructuring expenses associated with this excess office space see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
accounting for income taxes we follow the provision of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate an income tax provision for each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax provision or benefit together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent it is determined that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance is established 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision or benefit for income taxes and the amount of valuation allowance that would be required 
historically  we have not taken benefits for losses generated by most of our foreign entities and accordingly have recorded a valuation allowance against their deferred tax assets 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance  that could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations 
at december   we had a valuation allowance of million associated with million of gross deferred tax assets 
the net deferred tax asset of million represents net operating loss carryforwards and deductible temporary differences  which is more likely than not to be utilized in the future 
we considered all of the available evidence in evaluating the recoverability of our deferred tax assets  however  a change in circumstances  including our projected future taxable income  may have a material impact on future operating results 
valuation of long lived assets  investments and goodwill we have a significant amount of long lived assets including fixed assets  goodwill and investments 
we periodically evaluate the realizability of all of our long lived assets 
future events could cause us to conclude that an impairment exists and that the asset values associated with a given operation have become impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of and determined that no impairment had occurred 
we will continue to perform a goodwill impairment test annually  as well as when a triggering event indicating impairment may have occurred 
if our projections of future cash flows are lower than the current estimates  we may be required to recognize an impairment charge up to the carrying value of the goodwill of million 
lease guarantee we are the guarantor for centrport s obligations under their lease for office space at post road east  westport  connecticut  for  square feet  which expires on june   subject to renewal 
as of december   the aggregate remaining base rent and operating expenses due under this lease was million  subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the lease 
this balance reduces by approximately million per year through june  the lease provides that once of the original lease term has expired  which will occur in july  this guaranty may be replaced with an irrevocable letter of credit in favor of the landlord in an amount not to exceed the remaining base rent 
upon expiration of of the lease term  centrport is required to obtain such a letter of credit 
additionally  centrport has agreed to cooperate with us to secure our release from our guaranty prior to that time  if possible 
in the event that centrport were to default on its lease obligation  we would be liable for the aggregate remaining base rent and operating expenses at the time of default by centrport 
in the event of a default  we would take all appropriate action to be reimbursed for this liability 
as of december   no provision has been recorded for this potential liability 

table of contents restructuring and other charges  net continuing operations we initiated a series of restructuring actions in to align capacity with both revenue and the demand from our clients 
these actions were completed in the third and fourth quarters of and included staff reductions of employees and a reduction in office space in our us and london offices 
as a result of these actions  restructuring charges of million were recorded during the year ended december  in  we implemented various restructuring plans to reduce our operating expenses and strengthen our competitive and financial positions 
these actions were completed in the third quarter of and first quarter of and included the following a staff reductions and an increase in our accrual for excess office space in our san francisco office  established in  b the closure of our new york city office and its subsequent consolidation into our norwalk  connecticut office  c the decision to cease operations and close our office in tokyo  japan d the decision made in the fourth quarter of to cease operations in our office in paris  france and e the permanent decline in the value of certain marketable securities 
as a result of these actions  restructuring charges of million were recorded during the year ended december  in  we recorded charges related primarily to leased office space reductions in san francisco and tokyo  japan  the reduction in headcount and reorganization of capacity across multiple offices and the write off of deferred costs related to the proposed secondary public offering of our common stock that was cancelled 
as a result of these actions  restructuring charges of million were recorded during the year ended december  as a result of these office closures  restructuring and staff attrition  our full time equivalent employees defined as employees plus temporary workers  were reduced by  from full time equivalents at september  to full time equivalents at december  discontinued operations as noted above  due to the decline in client demand  we decided in the second quarter of to close our offices in toronto  munich and hong kong 
these offices ceased their operations in the third quarter of as a result of this decision  there were staff reductions of employees during the closedown period in and restructuring charges of million were recorded during the year ended december  these charges are recorded within the operating loss from discontinued operations in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
in  we approved various restructuring plans to reduce our operating expenses and strengthen our competitive and financial positions 
these actions  which were completed by the fourth quarter of  include staff reductions and the cancellation of our move to new office space in toronto as a result of the landlord s breach of contract 
as a result of these actions  restructuring charges of million were recorded during the year ended december  these charges are recorded within the operating loss from discontinued operations in our accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
centrport inc transaction and investment we and certain employees formed centrport llc in november to focus on developing intelligent marketing platforms to build and enhance customer relationships across multiple communication channels 
in december  centrport llc  which was originally organized as a delaware limited liability company  was reorganized as centrport  inc centrport  a delaware corporation 
immediately after this reorganization  we sold a portion of our ownership in centrport  which was formerly our majority owned subsidiary 
a consortium of third party investors the centrport investors purchased  shares of preferred stock of centrport from us centrport preferred stock sale in exchange for million in cash and a million note receivable originally due in december  subject to certain conditions 
in addition  we received a warrant to purchase  shares of centrport common stock from centrport centrport warrant 

table of contents concurrent with the centrport preferred stock sale  the centrport investors agreed to invest up to million directly into centrport 
at the closing of the transaction  million was paid by the centrport investors to centrport in exchange for  shares of newly issued centrport preferred stock 
subject to centrport s securing certain revenue commitments by april   an additional payment of million contingent payment would be due from the centrport investors to centrport in december centrport did not secure these certain commitments and as such the contingent payment was not made by the centrport investors to centrport 
in addition  concurrent with the centrport preferred stock sale  we purchased  shares of centrport common stock from certain minority centrport stockholders in exchange for approximately million of our common stock  or  shares the founders stock transaction 
in connection with the founders stock transaction  we recorded a charge to equity of approximately million based on the excess of the value paid for the founders stock and its estimated fair value on the date we acquired the stock 
the centrport preferred stock sale  the centrport warrant  the investment by the centrport investors directly into centrport and the founders stock transaction are hereinafter collectively referred to as the centrport transactions 
as a result of the centrport transactions  our ownership in centrport preferred and common stock  combined  was reduced from to  which was later reduced as discussed below 
through the date of the centrport transactions  we consolidated centrport and recognized of the losses incurred by centrport in consideration that we were centrport s sole funding source 
such losses aggregated approximately million 
subsequent to the centrport transactions we have accounted for our investment in centrport under the cost method 
in conjunction with the centrport transactions  we designated centrport as a preferred vendor and committed to resell at least million of centrport s products and services during pursuant to a value added reseller agreement centrport commitment 
based primarily on the uncertain nature of our ability to meet this centrport commitment  we deferred our gain of million on the centrport preferred stock sale 
the original agreement provided that  if the centrport commitment was not met  we were to remit the value of the shortfall to centrport in either centrport common stock from our holdings pursuant to a contractual per share fixed value  or in cash  at our election 
as of december   we had sold million in centrport products and services applicable to the centrport commitment 
as a result  we recognized million in the fourth quarter of of the million deferred gain that was recorded as of december  the remaining balance of the deferred gain on our balance sheet was equal to million as of december  in february  we  centrport and the centrport investors were party to agreements which amended various conditions and commitments including the extinguishment of our centrport commitment to sell further centrport products and services  the extinguishment of our obligation to pay the value of the shortfall in either cash or centrport common stock and the extension of our million note receivable due from the centrport investors to us until december   which was subsequently satisfied 
accordingly  we recognized the remaining deferred gain of million in the first quarter of in addition  as a result of a valuation we received from an independent firm regarding our investment in centrport as of december   we concluded that our investment in centrport was impaired 
accordingly we reduced our investment in centrport from million  reflected at december   to million by recording a million charge in the fourth quarter of in october  centrport closed on a second series of equity financing whereby centrport issued new equity to some of the centrport investors in exchange for cash the secondary financing 
we did not participate in the secondary financing 
as a result of the secondary financing  our ownership interest in centrport s common and preferred stock was reduced from to 
approval on non audit related services in the fourth quarter of  our audit committee approved the engagement of pricewaterhousecoopers llp  our independent accountants  to conduct an audit of our k plan  including a review of our form for our k plan  and to provide state local income and capital tax planning consulting 

table of contents historical results of operations clients hire us on a fixed fee  retainer or time and material basis 
a majority of our revenues are derived from fixed fee engagements 
we recognize revenues as services are rendered in accordance with sab no 
we reassess our estimated costs on fixed fee engagements periodically and  as needed for specific engagements  losses are accrued to the extent that costs incurred and anticipated costs to complete engagements exceed anticipated billings 
provisions for losses on uncompleted fixed fee contracts  if any  are recognized in the period in which such losses are determined 
our results of operations and our business depend on our relationships with a limited number of large clients with which we generally do not have long term contracts 
our clients generally have the right to terminate their relationships with us without penalty and with relatively short or no notice 
once an engagement is completed  we cannot be assured that a client will engage us for further services 
as a result  a client that generates substantial revenue for us in one period may not be a substantial source of revenue in a subsequent period 
the termination of our business relationships with any of our significant clients  or a material reduction in the use of our services by any of our significant clients  could adversely affect our future financial performance 
our ten largest clients accounted for  and of consolidated revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
three clients individually accounted for  and of our revenues in two clients accounted for and of our revenues in no clients accounted for or greater of our revenues in we expect a relatively high level of client concentration to continue which may not necessarily involve the same clients from period to period 
cost of revenues consists of salaries  employee benefits and incentive compensation for our professional services staff  costs for temporary staff that we use to provide professional services and certain other direct costs 
selling  general and marketing expenses consist of salaries  employee benefits and incentive compensation of new business development  sales and marketing  administrative and other non billable employees  certain other marketing costs  office rent  utilities  professional and consulting fees  travel  telephone and other related expenses 
year ended december   compared to year ended december  revenues 
revenues decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decline in revenues was primarily attributable to a decrease in the total billed hours and average revenue per hour for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the decrease in billed hours was primarily due to the decrease in demand for our services attributable to the general decline in the global economy  which resulted in reduced marketing spending from some of our significant clients  the winding down of a large project for one client in europe and the closure of our offices in paris  france and tokyo  japan 
revenues attributable to reimbursable pass through expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
cost of revenues and gross profit 
cost of revenues decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease in cost of revenues was primarily due to a decrease in full time equivalent employees as a result of restructuring actions taken in due to the decrease in demand for our services 
gross profit margin increased to of revenues for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  due to higher utilization defined as billed hours divided by local capacity hours for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this increase in utilization was primarily attributable to the decrease in capacity as a result of the restructuring actions taken during and selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended 
table of contents december  selling  general and administrative expenses represented of revenues for the year ended december   as compared to for the year ended december  the dollar decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of expense reduction actions representing reduced headcount and infrastructure costs during and  and the favorable settlement during the third quarter of of million of previously accrued liabilities 
restructuring and other charges  net 
restructuring and other charges  net of reversals  were million during  an increase of million  or  compared with million incurred in the charges represent costs incurred in connection with the initiation of a series of global restructuring actions to align capacity with expected revenue levels

the restructuring charges include million in lease related costs primarily related to office leases for our excess facilities  million in fixed asset dispositions and million for severance and other costs 
the charges primarily represent costs incurred in connection with the following a a significant and rapid deterioration in the commercial real estate market in san francisco resulting in an increase in the accrual for excess office space  established in  for an additional million  b the reduction of corporate headcount and reorganization of capacity across multiple offices for million  c the closure of our new york city office and its subsequent consolidation into our norwalk  connecticut office for million  d the decision to cease operations and close our office in tokyo  japan for million  e the decision made in the fourth quarter of to cease operations in our office in paris  france for million and f the permanent decline in the value of certain marketable securities for million 
impairment of goodwill 
in  we concluded that due to adverse market conditions as well as deteriorating operating results and cash flows in our paris  france office our goodwill associated with that office was no longer recoverable 
as such  we recorded an impairment of goodwill charge of million in the third quarter of see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in depreciation and amortization was primarily attributable to the restructuring actions taken which included the write off of certain property and equipment

impairment of investment in centrport 
as a result of the information we received from an independent firm regarding the valuation of our investment in centrport  we concluded that our investment in centrport was impaired and accordingly reduced our investment in centrport as of december  to million by recording a million charge 
we will continue to review our remaining centrport investment for impairment on an annual basis as well as when a triggering event indicating impairment may have occurred 
interest income 
interest income decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates realized on short term investment balances partially offset by higher average cash balances during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  
table of contents other expense  net 
other expense  net  decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this reduction in expense is primarily a result of a benefit of million from the favorable settlement during the third quarter of of previously accrued liabilities partially offset by the recognition of interest expense related to the accrual for the present value of the future costs of our excess office space in san francisco  norwalk and london 
loss from continuing operations before income taxes 
our loss from continuing operations before income taxes was million for the year ended december  as compared to a loss of million for the year ended december  the decrease in loss from continuing operations before income taxes of million was primarily due to the decrease in operating expenses  the elimination of goodwill amortization and the gain on the sale of centrport stock 
income taxes 
the benefit for income taxes for the year ended december  was million compared to a benefit for income taxes of million for the year ended december  the effective income tax rate was for the year ended december  compared to an effective income tax benefit rate of for the year ended december  during the year ended december   our effective income tax rate is less than the statutory rate primarily due to foreign tax losses for which no benefit was recorded and the difference in foreign tax rates 
the effective tax rate is more than the statutory tax rate during the year ended december  primarily due to the tax benefit in the us resulting from the shutdown of foreign offices partially offset by goodwill amortization and other items that were not tax deductible and foreign tax losses for which no benefit was recorded 
loss from continuing operations 
our loss from continuing operations was million  or per common share  for the year ended december  as compared to a loss from continuing operations of million  or per common share  for the year ended december  this increase in loss from continuing operations of million was primarily due to a different effective income tax rate applied to our loss before income taxes as mentioned above 
income loss from discontinued operations 
our income from discontinued operations was million for the year ended december  as compared to a loss from discontinued operations of million for the year ended december  cumulative effect of accounting change 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we performed the required transitional impairment test on our goodwill as of january  as a result of completing this test  we determined that the goodwill associated with our munich  germany operation was fully impaired as of january  accordingly  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million as a cumulative effect of an accounting change retroactive to january  there was no income tax benefit associated with this charge as we believe it is more likely than not that future taxable income in germany will not be sufficient to realize the related income tax benefit 
year ended december   compared to year ended december  revenues 
revenues decreased by million  or  to million for from million for this decline in revenues was primarily attributable to lower billed hours as the demand from our clients decreased due to the general decline in the global economy  partially offset by an increase in international revenue attributable to a large project for a european client 
cost of revenues and gross profit 
cost of revenues decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  gross profit margin declined to of revenues for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease in cost of revenues was primarily due to company wide reductions in capacity as a result of a decrease in revenues

as a result  our effective tax rate differs significantly from the statutory rate 
the effective tax during the year ended december  rate is more than the statutory tax rate primarily due to the tax benefit in the us resulting from the shutdown of foreign offices partially offset by goodwill amortization and other items which were not tax deductible and foreign tax losses for which no benefit was recorded

loss from discontinued operations 
our loss from discontinued operations was million for the year ended december  as compared to a loss from discontinued operations of million for the year ended december  factors affecting operating results our operating results have fluctuated in the past  and may continue to fluctuate in the future  as a result of a variety of factors  including our history of operating losses  the scope and timing of new assignments and client initiatives  the spending levels and budget constraints of our clients  our dependence on a limited number of clients  our allocation of resources to new business development  our effectiveness in attracting and retaining qualified staff  including management  our dependence on key management staff  our need and ability to manage the level of our staff and capacity in the future  our ability to accurately estimate costs in fixed fee engagements  exclusivity arrangements with clients that may limit our ability to provide services to others and other factors that are outside of our control 
other factors that may affect our future operating results are centrport s ability to execute its strategy and business plan and to meet its obligations under a lease for which we are guarantor  the potential future impairment of our goodwill  our ability to utilize our deferred tax asset  the variability of our operating results  our ability to integrate acquired companies  timing and amount of our capital expenditures  the ability of our sub tenants to continue to meet their obligation under our sub lease agreements  our ability to sub lease our unoccupied office space  our ability to manage future growth  pricing pressure for our services  the timing of collections from our clients  our ability to respond to rapid technological change  our dependence on the continued growth of the internet  the long term effects of the global recession  the effect of terrorist activities and military actions  and changes in government regulations  including regulation of privacy issues 
as a result  period to period comparisons of our operating results cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance

partially offsetting these items for the years ended december   and were repayments of debt and capital lease obligations of million  million and million  respectively 
we believe that our cash on hand and short term investments together with funds available from operations will be sufficient to meet our capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
we are the guarantor for centrport s obligations under our lease for office space at post road east  westport  connecticut  for  square feet  which expires on june   subject to renewal 
as of december   the aggregate remaining base rent and operating expenses due under this lease was million  subject to adjustment in accordance with the terms of the lease 
this balance reduces by approximately million per year through june  the lease provides that once of the original lease term has expired  which will occur in july  this guaranty may be replaced with an irrevocable letter of credit in favor of the landlord in an amount not to exceed the remaining base rent 
upon expiration of of the lease term  centrport is required to obtain such a letter of credit 
additionally  centrport has agreed to cooperate with us to secure our release from our guaranty prior to that time  if possible 
in the event that centrport were to default on its lease obligation  we would be liable for the aggregate remaining base rent and operating expenses at the time of default by centrport 
in the event of a default  we would take all appropriate action to be reimbursed for this liability 
in october  we established a program to repurchase over an eighteen month period up to million of our common stock 
the timing and amount of purchases will be dependent upon a number of factors including the price availability of our common stock  general market conditions and other uses of funds 
the program may be discontinued at any time 
during  we repurchased  shares of common stock at an average price of per share under this program 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
replaces eitf no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan as was required by eitf no 
examples of costs covered by sfas no 
include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring  discontinued operation  plant closing or other exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
is to be applied to exit or disposal activities initiated after december  sfas no 
is not expected to have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents in november  the fasb issued fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of other  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
 and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
fin elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements of guarantees and obligations to stand ready to perform over the term of the guarantee in the event that specified triggering events or conditions occur and the identification of those contingent obligations to make future payments if those triggering events or conditions occur 
additional disclosures have been added to commitments and contingencies footnote describing the nature of the guarantee  the amount and event triggering our obligation under the guarantee and our recourse to recover in such an event see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of sfas no 
 which provides optional transition guidance for those companies electing to voluntarily adopt the accounting provisions of sfas no 
in addition  the statement mandates certain interim disclosures that are incremental to those required by sfas no 
we will continue to account for stock based compensation in accordance with apb no 
as such  we do not expect this standard to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
we have adopted the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 
at december  
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars 
in  we derived of our revenues from operations outside of the us we face foreign currency risks primarily as a result of the revenues that we receive from services delivered through our foreign subsidiaries 
these subsidiaries incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  our foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations with respect to the british pound and brazilian real as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars for consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results when translated may vary from expectations and adversely impact net income loss and operating performance 
the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuation for the year ended december  was not material 
currently  we do not hedge foreign currency transactions into us dollars because we believe that  over time  the cost of a hedging program will outweigh any benefit of greater predictability in our us dollar denominated results 
however  we will from time to time reconsider the issue of whether a foreign currency hedging program would be beneficial to our operations 
we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily through our investments in cash equivalents and short term investments 
our investment policy calls for investment in short term  low risk instruments 
we have limited our exposure to interest rate risk by investing in securities with maturities of one year or less
