item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview mgi pharma  inc 
is an oncology focused biopharmaceutical company that acquires  develops and commercializes proprietary pharmaceutical products that meet cancer patient needs 
we focus our direct sales efforts solely within the united states and create alliances with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies for the commercialization of our products in other countries 
we promote products directly to physician specialists in the united states using our own sales force 
these products include salagen r tablets pilocarpine hydrochloride  hexalen r altretamine capsules  and didronel r etidronate disodium iv infusion 
salagen tablets are approved in the united states for two indications the symptoms of dry mouth associated with radiation treatment in head and neck cancer patients and the symptoms of dry mouth associated with sjogren s syndrome  an autoimmune disease that damages the salivary glands 
sales of salagen tablets in the united states accounted for percent of our product sales during hexalen capsules  which we began selling after we acquired the product from medimmune  inc in november  is an orally administered chemotherapeutic agent approved in the united states for treatment of refractory ovarian cancer patients 
didronel iv infusion is approved for the treatment of hypercalcemia elevated blood calcium in late stage cancer patients 
we rely on third parties to manufacture our commercialized and development stage products 
in april  we obtained the exclusive us and canadian license and distribution rights to palonosetron  a cancer supportive care product candidate for the prevention of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting 
the us food and drug administration accepted the filing of the new drug application for palonosetron on november  our current product development efforts include preclinical and clinical trials for irofulven  our novel anti cancer agent with demonstrated activity in a variety of cancers and a unique mechanism of action 
we are also developing mg and inhibitors of dna methyltransferase for north american markets 
dna methyltransferase is an enzyme that has been associated with uncontrolled tumor growth 
we also provide ongoing clinical support of salagen tablets 
results of operations critical accounting policies in preparing our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  our management must make decisions which impact reported amounts and related disclosures 
such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates 
in reaching such decisions  our management applies judgment based on our understanding and analysis of relevant circumstances 
note to the financial statements provides a summary of the significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of the financial statements 
our critical accounting policies include the following our accounting policy on revenue recognition is fully described in notes  and to the financial statements 
the majority of our revenue relates to product sales 
we recognize product sales revenue upon shipment to wholesalers 
as is common in the pharmaceutical industry  our domestic sales are made to pharmaceutical wholesalers for further distribution through pharmacies to the ultimate consumers of our products 
as such  our product sales revenue may be less than or greater than the underlying demand for our products 
we report sales revenue net of allowances for product returns  cash discounts  and other rebates 
to determine our estimates for product returns and other allowances  we use a combination of historical data and an estimate of future activity 
our estimates are sometimes made with limited data  and are therefore reviewed periodically and subject to change 
we also recognize revenue related to licensing agreements 
licensing revenue recognition requires management to estimate effective terms of agreements and identify points at which performance is met under the contracts such that the revenue earnings process is complete 
under this policy for out licensing arrangements  revenue related to up front  time based and performance based licensing payments is recognized over the entire contract performance period 
for our major licensing contracts  this results in the deferral of significant revenue amounts approximately million at december  where non refundable cash payments have been received  but the revenue is not immediately recognized due to the long term nature of the respective agreements 
following our initial estimate of the effective terms of these arrangements  subsequent developments such as contract modifications or terminations could increase or decrease the period over which the deferred revenue is recognized 
research and development expense includes work performed for us by outside vendors and research organizations 
at each reporting period  we estimate expenses incurred but not reported or billed to us by these outside vendors 
these expense estimates typically cover a period of to weeks of expense 
actual results are recorded on a timely basis and  historically  have not been materially different from our estimates 
in addition  costs related to in licensing arrangements for product candidates are expensed as research and development until their first commercial sale 
revenues sales sales revenue increased percent from  in  to  in  but decreased percent to  in as is common in the pharmaceutical industry  our domestic sales are made to pharmaceutical wholesalers for further distribution through pharmacies to the ultimate consumers of our products 
the increase in sales revenue from to reflects increased revenue from salagen tablets  resulting from an increase in demand  an increase in stocking of inventory by wholesalers and retail pharmacies  and an increase in selling price 
the increase in sales revenue also reflects revenue from hexalen capsules  which we purchased from medimmune inc in november  with sales commencing in december  and active field promotion commencing in march the decrease in sales revenue from to reflects decreased revenue from salagen tablets  resulting from a draw down of wholesaler inventory amounts  partially reduced by an increase in selling price and a continued increase in patient demand 
beginning in the second quarter of  and continuing throughout the rest of  a substantial increase in wholesaler inventory amounts occurred 
a reduction of wholesaler inventories occurred throughout the first half of in the second half of  sales realigned with underlying demand  which grew approximately percent from to  as measured by prescription growth 
sales of salagen tablets in the united states provided percent of our sales revenue in  percent in  and percent in we expect sales revenue for our currently marketed products for to range from million to million 
sales revenue for palonosetron is expected to range from million to million for the first month period following launch of the product 
promotion promotion revenue was  in we did not recognize any promotion revenue in or the change in promotion revenue reflects changes in our product promotion relationships 
in  we were promoting products under agreements with pharmacia corporation for azulfidine en tabs r and connetics corporation for ridaura r and luxiq r 
under the ridaura agreement  we recognized  in  based on achieving certain sales call activity 
the agreements for ridaura and luxiq concluded in the third quarter of we did not recognize any revenue for luxiq during the term of the agreement 
we concluded the azulfidine en tabs agreement in the first half of  without the recognition of any promotion fee revenue 
we do not expect any promotion revenue in licensing licensing revenue decreased six percent from  in to  in  and decreased four percent to  in in  the company adopted staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements and recorded a cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle for previously received  non refundable licensing payments 
this resulted in a million one time  non cash charge and a corresponding increase in deferred revenue effective as of the beginning of this deferred amount is being amortized into license revenue over the expected periods of benefit for the related collaborative arrangements 
licensing revenue is a combination of deferred revenue amortization from licensing arrangements and from royalties that are recognized when the related sales occur 
in  we received milestone payments of  from kissei related to the development of salagen tablets in japan   from novartis ophthalmics ag related to the licensing of salagen tablets in europe  and  from dainippon related to acylfulvene rights in japan 
in  we received a milestone payment of  from novartis ophthalmics ag related to the licensing of salagen tablets in europe 
we recognized   and  of amortized deferred revenue in  and  respectively  related to all payments received under these license agreements 
we will recognize the december  unamortized balance of  from our license agreements into licensing revenue over the expected periods of benefit for the related collaborative arrangements 
in the first quarter of  dainippon and mgi agreed to terminate their collaborative acylfulvene license agreement in august under sab  all remaining unamortized licensing revenue for dainippon will be amortized into license revenue in for  we expect to amortize  of deferred revenue into licensing revenue 
this includes  related to the dainippon agreement  of which  is expected to be recognized in the third quarter of future licensing revenue will fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on the level of recurring royalty generating activities  and changes in amortization of deferred revenue  including the initiation or termination of licensing arrangements 
we expect licensing revenue for  including approximately million related to the dainippon agreement  to be approximately million 
costs and expenses cost of sales cost of sales as a percent of sales was eight percent for  percent for and percent for the increases result from a change in our product mix  including the addition of hexalen capsules to our oncology product portfolio  and an increase in production costs 
we believe that cost of sales as a percent of product sales for our currently marketed products for will range from to percent 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased percent from  in to  in  and increased one percent to  in the increase from to resulted primarily from increased costs related to our expanded business objectives  such as costs associated with the expansion of our us based sales force  costs related to commencement of active field promotion in march of hexalen capsules and mylocel tablets  costs associated with the growth in the number of corporate based associates  and increased facility costs in conjunction with our move to a new office location in the second quarter of although total costs remained essentially unchanged from to  our costs increased for field selling expense and decreased for direct product promotion and facility expenses 
promotion costs decreased from to due to our initiating promotion of hexalen capsules and mylocel tablets in facility costs decreased from to due to an accrual in for lease obligations for the former office space in excess of estimated sublease income  and physical move costs related to our move to a new office location in the second quarter of also includes  in expense related to a reduction in our workforce in the second quarter of as described in note to the financial statements  we used a related party for consulting services prior to  and  of related party consulting costs are included in selling  general and administrative expense for and  respectively 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses for to be approximately million 
the increase from is primarily a result of expenses related to the potential launch of palonosetron in the second half of research and development research and development expense increased percent from  in to  in  but decreased percent to  in all three periods include non recurring license payments million in related to our license agreement with methylgene inc  million in related to our license agreement for palonosetron  and million in related to our license agreement for palonosetron 
exclusive of non recurring license payments  research and development expense increased percent from  in to  in  but decreased percent to  in excluding non recurring license payments  the increase from to reflected the expanded development of irofulven  our novel anti cancer agent  and expenses related to the development of mg and inhibitors of dna methyltransferase under a license that began in the third quarter of the decrease from to represents decreased spending for irofulven 
in april  we stopped our phase trial of irofulven in advanced stage  gemcitabine refractory pancreatic cancer patients 
we are currently conducting a series of clinical trials designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of irofulven administered as a single chemotherapy agent or in combination with marketed chemotherapy agents for the treatment of patients with solid tumor cancers who are generally refractory to current therapies 
the decrease in irofulven spending was partially offset by  in expense related to a reduction in our workforce in the second quarter of we expect research and development expense for to range from million to million  including an million non recurring license payment that will become due upon the approval of the nda for palonosetron 
interest income interest income decreased percent from  in to  in  and decreased percent to  in the decreases are a result of decreases in the investment yields  partially reduced by increases in the average amount of funds available for investment 
funds available in increased as a result of the sales of stock in the second and fourth quarters of funds available in additionally increased as a result of the issuance of convertible notes and warrants in the fourth quarter of interest income for will fluctuate depending on the timing of cashflows and changes in interest rates for marketable securities 
interest expense we recognized interest expense of  in related to our issuance of convertible debt in the fourth quarter of we had no debt in or we expect interest expense for to be approximately million  of which  will be paid using cash 
the non cash portion of interest expense is primarily related to the issuance of warrants in conjunction with the issuance of our convertible debt see note to the financial statements 
tax expense the tax amount for reflects the percent foreign tax rate on licensing payments received 
there is no provision for tax expense in or  due to the net loss of million in and the net loss of million in our ability to achieve profitable operations is dependent upon our successful launch of palonosetron  and therefore  we continue to maintain a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
net loss we had a net loss of  in  which includes a non cash charge of  relating to the adoption of sab we had a net loss of  in  and a net loss of  in the increased net loss from to reflects a percent increase in revenues from to  and an percent increase in costs and expenses from to  including a percent increase in research and development 
the increased loss from to reflects a percent decrease in revenues from to  and a six percent decrease in costs and expenses 
during the next several years  we expect to direct our efforts towards activities intended to grow long term revenues  including the continued development and launch of palonosetron and continued development of irofulven and other product candidates 
increased spending on these initiatives will likely result in substantial net losses until after our successful launch of palonosetron 
we expect our net loss for to be approximately million  excluding any favorable net contribution from the potential product launch of palonosetron 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash and marketable investments of  and working capital of  compared with  and  respectively  at december  for the year ended december   we received gross proceeds of  from the issuance of convertible notes and warrants   in cash from issuance of shares under stock award plans  and  in cash as a deposit from one of our international partners 
we used  of cash to fund our operating activities 
in addition   of restricted cash was used to pay a palonosetron milestone 
we also paid the final installment of  related to the acquisition of hexalen capsules  and purchased  in equipment and furniture 
significant cash use in will be required to fund operating activities  pay million to helsinn healthcare upon approval by the fda of the nda for palonosetron  and pay million to dainippon following the termination of our licensing agreement 
substantial amounts of capital are required for pharmaceutical development and commercialization efforts 
for continued development and commercialization of our product candidates and marketed products  and the acquisition and development of additional product candidates  we plan to utilize cash provided from product sales  collaborative arrangements and existing liquid assets 
we will seek other sources of funding  including additional equity or debt issuances as appropriate 
excluding the potential favorable effect on cash of palonosetron product sales  we expect cash use for to be approximately million  which includes cash required to launch and promote palonosetron 
we have no arrangements or covenants that would trigger acceleration of our lease obligations or long term liabilities 
under the terms of our convertible debt agreement  we are precluded from raising additional capital at less than per share  until the earliest to occur of our anticipated disclosure of phase palonosetron data in june  or december our liquidity is affected by a variety of factors  including sales of our products  the pace of our research and development programs  the in licensing of new products and our ability to raise additional debt or equity capital 
as identified in our risk factors  adverse changes that affect our continued access to the capital markets  continued development and expansion of our product candidates  and future demand for our marketed products would affect our longer term liquidity 
we believe we have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to fund all known cash requirements through december  if the approval of palonosetron is delayed from our expectations  we may not have sufficient capital to continue operations as planned 
our significant future  noncancellable  contractual commitments  including the anticipated payment to helsinn upon approval by the fda  are summarized in the following table thereafter lease payments       approval of palonosetron payment  dainippon payment  convertible debt  total       selected quarterly operating results the following table shows our unaudited financial information for each of the quarters in the two year period ended december  in our opinion  this unaudited quarterly information has been prepared on the same basis as the audited financial statements and includes all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of the information for the quarters presented  when read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes included elsewhere in this annual report
