critical accounting policies the securities and exchange commission sec has issued disclosure guidance for critical accounting policies 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
management of the company is required to make certain estimates and assumptions during the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these estimates and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
however  management considers the following policies to be critical within the sec definition 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or average or market value and have been reduced by an allowance for excess and obsolete inventories 
the estimate is based on management s review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales 
cost includes material  labor and manufacturing overhead 
long lived assets long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset  which is generally based on discounted cash flows 
goodwill  which is not subject to amortization  is tested annually for impairment  and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of an applicable reporting unit exceeds its fair value 
accounts receivable the company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts after considering the collectibility of balances due  the credit worthiness of the customer and its current level of business with the customer 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
postemployment benefits the company provides life insurance and health care benefits for eligible retirees and health care benefits for retirees eligible survivors 
the costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect the company s assumptions as to general economic conditions and health care cost trends 
the cost of providing plan benefits also depends on demographic assumptions including retirements  mortality  turnover  and plan participation 
if actual experience differs from these assumptions  the cost of providing these benefits could increase or decrease 
intangible assets the useful life of an intangible asset is based on the company s assumptions regarding expected use of the asset  the relationship of the intangible asset to another asset or group of assets  any legal  regulatory or contractual provisions that may limit the useful life of the asset or that enable renewal or extension of the asset s legal or contractual life without substantial cost  the effects of obsolescence  demand  competition and other economic factors  and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the asset and their related impact on the asset s useful life 
if events or circumstances indicate that the life of an intangible asset has changed  it could result in higher future amortization charges or recognition of an impairment loss 
related party transactions the company is not engaged and has not engaged in related party transactions 
all transactions of the company have been at arms length 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of operations  the company is exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in interest rates 
market risk is defined for these purposes as the potential change in the fair value of debt instruments resulting from an adverse movement in interest rates 
as of december   the company s only borrowings were under a bank term loan  which bears interest at libor plus 
a basis point increase in interest rates  applied to the company s borrowings at december   would result in an increase in annual interest expense and a corresponding reduction in cash flow of approximately the company s short term working capital borrowings have historically borne interest based on the prime rate 
the company believes that its exposure to market risk relating to interest rate risk is not material 
the company has no derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments  nor does the company have any financial instruments entered into for trading or hedging purposes 
foreign sales are generally billed in us dollars 
the company believes that its business operations are not exposed in any material respect to market risk relating to foreign currency exchange risk or commodity price risk
