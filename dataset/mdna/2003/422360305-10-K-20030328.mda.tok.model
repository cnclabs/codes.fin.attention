helix owned or managed  prior to the combination  hearing healthcare clinics located in massachusetts  new york  ohio  michigan  wisconsin  minnesota  washington and missouri as well as in the provinces of ontario and quebec 
the transaction is effective for financial reporting purposes on june   the first day of the company s third quarter of in connection with the completion of the helix combination  on july  the company changed its name from hearx ltd 
to hearusa  inc and increased its authorized capital 
the company s common stock continues to trade on the american stock exchange under the symbol ear

as a result of the recent combination with helix  the company has a network consisting of company owned or managed centers in states and canadian provinces and approximately affiliated providers in states 
the company intends  as its long term goal  to establish a nationwide network of affiliated providers and company owned hearing care centers 
critical accounting policies management believes the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements goodwill and intangible assets the majority of the company s goodwill and other intangible assets resulted from the combination with helix 
on at least an annual basis  the company is required to assess whether its goodwill is impaired 
in order to do this  management applied judgment in determining its reporting units  which represent distinct parts of the company s business 
the definition of the company s reporting units affects the company s goodwill impairment assessments 
the company s annual goodwill impairment assessment involves estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and comparing it with its carrying amount 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  additional steps are required to calculate a potential impairment loss 
calculating the fair value of the reporting units requires significant estimates and long term assumptions 
any changes in key assumptions about the business and its prospects  or changes in market conditions  interest rates or other externalities  could result in an impairment charge 
the company estimates the fair value of its reporting units by applying a weighted average of three methods quoted market price  external transactions  and discounted cash flow 
revenue recognition hearusa recognizes revenues from the sale of audiological products at the time of delivery and revenues from hearing care services at the time those services are performed 
the company has capitation contracts with certain health care organizations under which the company is paid an amount for each enrollee of the health maintenance organization to provide to the enrollee a once every three years discount on certain hearing products and services 
the amount paid to the company by the healthcare organization is calculated on a per capita basis and is referred to as capitation revenue 
the company defers recognition of capitation revenue until the earlier of the actual utilization by the member populations of the benefit  or the end of the contract term 
sales returns the company provides to all patients purchasing hearing aids a specific return period of at least days if the patient is dissatisfied with the product 
the company provides an allowance in accrued expenses for returns 
the return period can be extended to days if the patient attends the company s help program 
estimates the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates these estimates  including those related to allowances for doubtful accounts receivable and sales returns 
management bases these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates

in addition  approximately million of the decrease in working capital resulted from the combination of helix s current assets of approximately million less current liabilities of approximately million as of june  on december   hearusa obtained a  secured credit facility from siemens comprised of a a  secured five year term loan credit facility the tranche a loan  b a  secured five year revolving loan credit facility the tranche b loan  c a  secured five year term loan facility the tranche c loan  and d a  secured five year term loan credit facility the tranche d loan

the siemens credit facility imposes certain financial and other covenants on the company  which are customary for loans of this size and nature 
if the company cannot maintain compliance with these covenants  siemens may terminate future funding under the credit facility and declare all then outstanding amounts under the facility immediately due and payable 
the tranche a  b and c loans are payable quarterly over five years with the outstanding principal and interest at  due and payable on the final maturity date 
principal and interest  at the prime rate as defined plus one percent  on the tranche d loan is payable on the final maturity date 
quarterly principal and interest payments on the tranche a  b and c loans may be paid through preferred pricing reductions received from siemens by hearusa as long as the company purchases certain minimum percentages of its requirements of hearing aids from siemens 
as of december   the company has an excess of current liabilities over current assets of approximately million 
for the year ended december   the company incurred a net loss of approximately million 
the company is dependent upon generating sufficient cash flow from operations or financings to repay its liabilities 
additionally  the company s supply agreement with siemens requires full payment for hearing aids purchased from siemens within days 
as of december   the company was not in compliance with those payment provisions 
upon such noncompliance  siemens may declare the company to be in default of the supply agreement by written notification  which  if not cured within days of the date of written notification  would be an event of default under the company s  secured credit facility with siemens

the additional funding was obtained pursuant to an amendment to the company s credit agreement with siemens and is otherwise subject to the terms and conditions of the credit agreement and related security agreement 
as a result of the completion of the combination with helix and significant cost cutting initiatives taken throughout and  the company believes that funds available under the siemens credit facility  current cash  investment securities and revenues from operations  at current net revenue levels  will be sufficient to support the company s operational needs through the next twelve months  although there can be no assurance that the company can maintain compliance with siemens loan covenants  meet the day payment terms of the siemens supply agreement  that net revenue levels will remain at or higher than current levels or that unexpected capital needs will not arise for which the credit facility  cash  investments and revenues from operations will be sufficient 
in the event the company needs to raise additional money to fund unexpected cash needs or otherwise to meet requirements  one or more of the following opportunities will be evaluated accounts receivable financing  short term debt or equity offerings 
there can be no assurance  however  that such financing would be available to the company on favorable terms or at all
