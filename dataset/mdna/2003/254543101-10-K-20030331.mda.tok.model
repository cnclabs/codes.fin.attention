in addition  diodes china leases its manufacturing facilities from  subcontracts a portion of its manufacturing process metal plating to  and pays a consulting fee to xing international 
all such transactions are on terms no less favorable to the company than could be obtained from unaffiliated third parties 
manufacturing and significant vendors the company s far east subsidiary  diodes china  manufactures product for sale primarily to north america and asia 
diodes china s manufacturing focuses on sot and sod products  as well as sub miniature packages such as sot  sot  and sc these surface mount devices smd are much smaller in size and are used in the computer and communication industries  destined for cellular phones  notebook computers  pagers  pcmcia cards  modems  and garage door transmitters  among others 
diodes china s state of the art facilities have been designed to develop even smaller  higher density products as electronic industry trends to portable and hand held devices continue 
although diodes china purchases silicon wafers from fabtech  the majority are currently purchased from other wafer vendors 
the company plans to increase the number of diodes fabtech wafers used at diodes china over the next several years 
acquired in december from lsc  fabtech s wafer foundry is located in lee s summit  missouri 
fabtech manufactures primarily inch silicon wafers  which are the building blocks for semiconductors 
fabtech has full foundry capabilities  including processes such as silicon epitaxy  silicon oxidation  photolithography and etching  ion implantation and diffusion  low pressure and plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition  sputtered and evaporated metal deposition  wafer backgrinding  and wafer probe and ink 
diodes fabtech purchases polished silicon wafers  and then by using various technologies  in conjunction with many chemicals and gases  fabricates several layers on the wafers  including epitaxial silicon  ion implants  dielectrics  and metals  with various patterns 
depending upon these layers and the die size which is determined during the photolithography process and completed at the customer s packaging site where the wafer is sawn into square or rectangular die  different types of wafers with various currents  voltages  and switching speeds are produced 
all of the products sold by the company  as well as the materials used by the company in its manufacturing operations  are available both domestically and abroad 
in  the largest external supplier of products to the company was lsc  a related party 
approximately and of the company s sales were from product manufactured by lsc in and  respectively 
also  in and  approximately and  respectively of the company s sales were from product manufactured by companies owned by xing international  the minority partner in diodes china  and a related party 
in addition  sales of products manufactured by diodes china and diodes fabtech  the company s manufacturing subsidiaries  were approximately and in  respectively  versus and in  respectively 
the company anticipates that diodes china will become an increasingly valuable supplier 
no other manufacturer of discrete semiconductors accounted for more than and of the company s sales in and  respectively 
although the company believes alternative sources exist for the products of any of its suppliers  the loss of any one of its principal suppliers or the loss of several suppliers in a short period of time could have a materially adverse effect on the company until an alternate source is located and has commenced providing such products or raw materials 
recent results the discrete semiconductor industry has historically been subject to severe pricing pressures 
at times  although manufacturing costs have decreased  excess manufacturing capacity and over inventory have caused selling prices to decrease to a greater extent than manufacturing costs 
to compete in this highly competitive industry  the company has committed substantial new resources to the further development and implementation of sales and marketing functions  and expanded manufacturing capabilities 
emphasizing the company s focus on customer service  additional sales personnel and programs have been added  primarily in asia  and most recently europe 
in order to meet customers needs at the design stage of end product development  the company also continues to employ additional applications engineers who work directly with customers to assist them in designing in the correct products to produce optimum results 
regional sales managers in the us  working closely with manufacturers representative firms and distributors  have also been added to help satisfy customers requirements 
in addition  the company continues to develop relationships with major distributors who inventory and sell the company s products 
beginning in the second half of  and continuing through the first three quarters of  industry demand significantly exceeded industry capacity 
in addition  oem customers and distributors increased their purchasing and inventory levels in anticipation of further increases in end product demand 
the company s gross profit margin reached a peak of in the third quarter of then  as semiconductor manufacturers  including the company  continued to increase manufacturing capacity  the global economy slowed causing a sharp decline in sales beginning in the fourth quarter of the semiconductor industry as a whole experienced a sharp inventory correction primarily in two key markets  communications and computers 
the effect on the company of these unforeseen economic and market conditions  and the risks of becoming a fully integrated manufacturer were amplified with the december completion of the wafer facility acquisition because of the fixed costs associated with the additional manufacturing facility 
although the company s market share increased in  average selling prices for discrete products decreased approximately and silicon wafer pricing fell approximately 
due to decreased demand in  the company also experienced reduced capacity utilization of its manufacturing facilities and demand induced changes in product mix  both of which had a negative impact on gross margins 
due to market conditions  capacity utilization at diodes fabtech decreased to  while diodes china s utilization was  during the third quarter of during  the company responded to the downturn by implementing programs to cut operating costs  including reducing its worldwide workforce by  primarily at the fabtech and diodes china manufacturing facilities 
some improvement was seen in the fourth quarter of when capacity utilization increased to and for diodes china and diodes fabtech  respectively  but gross margins still ended the year at 
year continued to be a year where demand improved  the company s manufacturing capacity utilization increased  and pricing pressures eased somewhat 
average selling prices decreased approximately for discrete products and for wafer products 
gross margins increased from in the first quarter to a high of in the third quarter when diodes china s capacity utilization reached approximately and diodes fabtech approximately 
the gross margin was for the year 
the company continues to actively adjust its cost structure as dictated by market conditions 
long term  the company believes that it will continue to generate value for shareholders and customers  not just from its expanded diodes china manufacturing and diodes fabtech s foundry assets  but also by the addition of an enhanced technology component to the company 
this is a multi year initiative that will increase the company s ability to serve its customers needs  while establishing the company at the forefront of the next generation of discrete technologies 
in december  the company completed its implementation of oracle s enterprise resource planning erp software 
the company anticipates increased efficiency through improved management of its global supply chain  manufacturing  customer service  planning and financial analysis 
income taxes in accordance with the current taxation policies of the people s republic of china prc  diodes china was granted preferential tax treatment for the years ended december  through earnings were subject to tax rates from through  and in earnings in will be taxed at one half the normal central government tax rate  and at normal rates thereafter 
earnings of diodes china are also subject to tax of by the local taxing authority in shanghai 
the local taxing authority waived this tax in earnings of diodes taiwan are currently subject to a tax rate of  which is comparable to the us federal tax rate for c corporations 
in accordance with united states tax law  the company receives credit against its us federal tax liability for corporate taxes paid in taiwan and china 
the repatriation of funds from taiwan and china to the company may be subject to state income taxes 
in the years ending december  and  diodes taiwan distributed dividends of approximately million and million respectively  which is included in federal and state taxable income 
as of december   accumulated and undistributed earnings of diodes china was approximately million 
through march   the company had not recorded deferred federal or state tax liabilities estimated to be million on these cumulative earnings since the company  at that time  considered this investment to be permanent  and had no plans or obligation to distribute all or part of that amount from china to the united states 
beginning in april  the company began to record deferred taxes on a portion of the earnings of diodes china in preparation of a possible dividend distribution 
as of december   the company has recorded  in deferred taxes and has made no distributions 
the company is evaluating the need to provide additional deferred taxes for the future earnings of diodes china to the extent such earnings may be appropriated for distribution to the company s corporate office in north america  and as further investment strategies with respect to diodes china are determined 
should the company s north american cash requirements exceed the cash that is provided through the domestic credit facilities  cash can be obtained from the company s foreign subsidiaries 
however  the distribution of any unappropriated funds to the us will require the recording of income tax provisions on the us entity  thus reducing net income

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves and income taxes  among others 
our estimates are based upon historical experiences  market trends and financial forecasts and projections  and upon various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and at that certain point in time 
actual results may differ  significantly at times  from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates  among others  affect the significant estimates and judgments we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition revenue is recognized when the product is actually shipped to both end users and electronic component distributors 
the company reduces revenue in the period of sale for estimates of product returns  distributor price adjustments and other allowances 
actual returns and adjustments could be different from our estimates and provisions  resulting in future adjustments to revenues 
allowance for doubtful accounts management evaluates the collectability of our accounts receivable based upon a combination of factors  including the current business environment and historical experience 
if we are aware of a customer s inability to meet its financials obligations to us  we record an allowance to reduce the receivable to the amount we reasonable believe we will be able to collect from the customer 
for all other customers  we record an allowance based upon the amount of time the receivables are past due 
if actual accounts receivable collections differ from these estimates  an adjustment to the allowance may be necessary with a resulting effect to bad debt expense 
inventory reserves inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is determined principally by the first in  first out method 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our inventory for obsolescence and slow moving items 
this evaluation includes analysis of sales levels  sales projections and purchases by items 
based upon this analysis we accrue a reserve for obsolete and slow moving inventory 
if future demand or market conditions are different than our current estimates  an inventory adjustment may be required  and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period the revision is made 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves using an asset and liability approach whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for differences in the financial reporting bases and tax bases of the company s assets and liabilities 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities 
management continually evaluates its deferred tax asset as to whether it is likely that the deferred tax assets will be realized 
if management ever determined that its deferred tax asset was not likely to be realized  a write down of the asset would be required and would be reflected as an expense in the accompanying period 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage that certain items in the statement of income bear to net sales and the percentage dollar increase decrease of such items from period to period

this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere herein 
year compared to year net sales for increased  to  from  for the increase was due primarily to a increase in units sold as a result of increased demand for the company s products  as well as an easing of pricing pressures 
although selling prices stabilized compared to  suggesting an easing of pricing pressures  there can be no assurance this trend will continue for average selling prices in decreased approximately for discrete products and for wafer products 
gross profit for increased to  from  for of the  increase   was due to the increase in gross profit margin from in to in  while  was due to the increase in net sales 
gross profit increases for wafer products was the primary contributor to the gross profit increase in gross profit in was adversely affected by higher fixed costs associated with the company s wafer fabrication facility  reduced capacity utilization at both the wafer facility and the china manufacturing facility  as well as by demand induced product mix changes and inventory pricing adjustments at distributors related to lower market prices 
for  selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased  to  from  for the increase in sg a was due primarily to higher sales commissions associated with the increase in sales  and higher wages and benefits expenses 
sg a also increased due to higher corporate and administrative expenses  including insurance expense partly offset by reduced goodwill amortization expense per the new account pronouncements 
sg a  as a percentage of sales  decreased to for from last year 
research and development expenses r d increased to  or of sales  in from  or of sales  in r d expenses are primarily related to new product development at the silicon wafer level 
the company plans to further expand its investment in r d in to develop new specialized products 
net interest expense for decreased  to  from  in  due primarily to a decrease in the use the company s credit facilities 
in  the company paid down its credit facilities by million  from million to million 
other income for decreased approximately  compared to last year  primarily due to i a severance payment as per a separation agreement  ii discontinuance of income diodes fabtech was receiving from an external company s use of its testing facilities  and iii currency exchange losses primarily in asia 
the company recorded a provision for income taxes in the amount of  for the year  compared to an income tax benefit of  for  due primarily to increased income in the us at higher tax rates 
included in the tax provision in is  in deferred taxes recorded for a portion of the earnings at diodes china 
minority interest in joint venture represents the minority investor s share of the diodes china joint venture s income for the period 
the increase in the joint venture earnings for is primarily the result of increased gross profit margins due to increased capacity utilization 
the joint venture investment is eliminated in consolidation of the company s financial statements  and the activities of diodes china are included therein 
as of december   the company had a controlling interest in the joint venture 
the company generated net income of  or basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share in  as compared to  or basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share for this  increase is due primarily to the sales increase at gross profit margins of compared to gross profit margins of in year compared to year net sales for decreased  to  from  for the decrease was due primarily to i a decrease in units sold  and ii a decrease in average selling prices of  both as a result of decreased demand attributable to a slower economy  above normal customer inventories and market pricing pressures 
average selling prices in decreased approximately 
gross profit for decreased to  from  for of the  decrease   was due to the decrease in gross profit margin from in to in  while  was due to the decrease in net sales 
gross profit for was adversely affected by higher fixed costs associated with the company s wafer fabrication facility  reduced capacity utilization at both the wafer facility and the china manufacturing facility  as well as by demand induced product mix changes and inventory pricing adjustments at distributors related to lower market prices 
for  selling  general and administrative expenses sg a decreased  to  from  for the decrease in sg a was due primarily to lower sales commissions associated with the decrease in sales  and lower wages and benefits expenses resulting from a work force reduction which began in the fourth quarter of sg a also decreased due to lower corporate and administrative expenses  partly offset by the inclusion of sg a expenses and goodwill amortization associated with the december fabtech acquisition 
sg a  as a percentage of sales  decreased to for from last year 
research and development expenses r d increased to  or of sales  in from  or of sales  in r d expenses are primarily related to new product development at the silicon wafer level 
net interest expense for increased  due primarily to an increase use of the company s credit facility to support the expansion of diodes china and the acquisition of fabtech 
other income for increased approximately  compared to the previous year  primarily due to high technology grants received by diodes china  rental income generated by diodes fabtech for the use of some of its testing facilities  and currency exchange gains at the company s subsidiaries in taiwan and china  partially offset by management incentives associated with the fabtech acquisition 
as per the terms of the stock purchase agreement  the company has entered into several management incentive agreements with members of fabtech s management 
the agreements provide members of fabtech s management guaranteed annual payments as well as contingent bonuses based on the annual profitability of fabtech  subject to a maximum annual amount 
in  the contingent bonuses were not earned or paid 
the total guaranteed commitment is  per year 
although the  is reimbursed by lsc the previous owner of fabtech to the company  because lsc is a principal shareholder in the company  the  per year is accounted for as an expense 
the company recorded an income tax benefit in the amount of  for the year  compared to an income tax provision of  for the reported income tax rate as a percentage of pretax income differs from the statutory combined federal and state tax rates of approximately due primarily to i currently the effective tax rate of diodes china is approximately  and deferred us federal and state income taxes are not provided on these earnings  and ii deferred income tax benefits at a rate of have been recognized on losses incurred at diodes fabtech 
minority interest in joint venture represents the minority investor s share of the diodes china joint venture s income for the period 
the decrease in the joint venture earnings for is primarily the result of decreased gross profit margins due to excess capacity and demand induced product mix changes 
the joint venture investment is eliminated in consolidation of the company s financial statements  and the activities of diodes china are included therein 
as of december   the company had a controlling interest in the joint venture 
the company generated net income of  or basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share in  as compared to  or basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share for this  or decrease is due primarily to the sales decrease at gross profit margins of compared to gross profit margins of in  partly offset by a decrease of  in operating expenses 
financial condition liquidity and capital resources the company s liquidity requirements arise from the funding of its working capital needs  primarily inventory  work in process and accounts receivable 
the company s primary sources for working capital and capital expenditures are cash flow from operations  borrowings under the company s bank credit facilities and borrowings from principal stockholders 
any withdrawal of support from its banks or principal stockholders could have serious consequences on the company s liquidity 
the company s liquidity is dependent  in part  on customers paying within credit terms  and any extended delays in payments or changes in credit terms given to major customers may have an impact on the company s cash flow 
in addition  any abnormal product returns or pricing adjustments may also affect the company s source of short term funding 
cash provided by operating activities in was million compared to million in and million in the primary sources of cash flows from operating activities in were depreciation and amortization of million and net income of million 
the primary sources of cash flows from operating activities in were a decrease in inventories of million and depreciation and amortization of million 
the primary sources of cash flows from operating activities in were net income of million and depreciation and amortization of million 
the primary use of cash flows from operating activities in was an increase in accounts receivable of million 
the primary use of cash flows from operating activities in was a decrease in accrued liabilities of million and an increase in deferred income taxes of million 
the primary use of cash flows from operating activities in was an increase in inventories of million and an increase in accounts receivable of million 
for the year ended december   accounts receivable increased compared to the increase in sales due to a slowing trend in payments  primarily from major distributors and far east customers 
the company continues to closely monitor its credit terms  while at times providing extended terms  required primarily by far east customers 
the ratio of the company s current assets to current liabilities on december  was to  compared to a ratio of to and to as of december  and  respectively 
cash used by investing activities was million in  compared to million in and million in the primary investments were for additional manufacturing equipment and expansion at the diodes china manufacturing facility  as well as the fabtech acquisition payments in and on december   the company purchased all the outstanding capital stock of fabtech incorporated  a inch wafer foundry located in lee s summit  missouri from lite on semiconductor corporation lsc  the company s largest stockholder 
the acquisition purchase price consisted of approximately million in cash and an earn out of up to million if fabtech meets specified earnings targets over a four year period 
in and  these earnings targets were not met  and  therefore  no earn out was paid 
in addition  fabtech was obligated to repay an aggregate of approximately million  consisting of i approximately million note payable to lsc  ii approximately million note payable to the company  and iii approximately million note payable to a financial institution  which amount was repaid on december  with the proceeds of a capital contribution by the company 
the acquisition was financed internally and through bank credit facilities 
in june  according to the company s us bank covenants  diodes fabtech was not permitted to make regularly scheduled principal and interest payments to lsc on the remaining million payable related to the fabtech acquisition note  but was  however  able to renegotiate with lsc the terms of the note 
under the terms of the amended and restated subordinated promissory note  payments of approximately  plus interest were scheduled to begin again in july  provided the company met the terms of its us bank s covenants 
in may  the company renegotiated the terms of the note to extend the payment period from two years to four years  and therefore  payments of approximately  plus interest began in july cash used by financing activities was million in  as the company reduced its overall debt  compared to cash provided by financing activities of million in and million in in  the company paid down its total credit facilities by million  from million to million 
at december   the company s total bank credit facility of million encompasses one major us bank  three banks in mainland china and four in taiwan 
as of december   the total credit lines were million  million  and million  for the us facility secured by substantially all assets  the unsecured chinese facilities  and the unsecured taiwanese facilities  respectively 
as of december   the available credit was million  million  and million  for the us facility  the chinese facilities  and the taiwanese facilities  respectively 
in february  the company and its us bank renewed its million revolving credit line  extending it for two years  and obtained an additional million credit facility to be used for capital expenditure requirements at its wafer fabrication facility 
this million facility increases the company s total credit facility to million  with the total available and unused credit of million 
the agreements have certain covenants and restrictions  which  among other matters  require the maintenance of certain financial ratios and operating results  as defined in the agreements  and prohibit the payment of dividends 
the company was in compliance with its covenants as of december  the company has used its credit facilities primarily to fund the expansion at diodes china and for the fabtech acquisition  as well as to support its operations 
the company believes that the continued availability of these credit facilities  together with internally generated funds  will be sufficient to meet the company s current foreseeable operating cash requirements 
the company has entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a major us bank which expires november   to hedge its exposure to variability in expected future cash flows resulting from interest rate risk related to of its long term debt 
the interest rate under the swap agreement is fixed at and is based on the notional amount 
the swap contract is inversely correlated to the related hedged long term debt and is therefore considered an effective cash flow hedge of the underlying long term debt 
the level of effectiveness of the hedge is measured by the changes in the market value of the hedged long term debt resulting from fluctuation in interest rates 
during and  variable interest rates decreased resulting in an interest rate swap liability of  as of december  as a matter of policy  the company does not enter into derivative transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
total working capital increased approximately to million as of december   from million as of december  the company believes that such working capital position will be sufficient for foreseeable operations and growth opportunities 
the company s total debt to equity ratio decreased to at december   from at december  it is anticipated that this ratio may increase should the company use its credit facilities to fund additional inventory sourcing opportunities 
the company has no material plans or commitments for capital expenditures other than in connection with manufacturing expansion at diodes china  diodes fabtech equipment requirements  and the company s implementation of the erp software package 
however  to ensure that the company can secure reliable and cost effective inventory sourcing to support and better position itself for growth  the company is continuously evaluating additional internal manufacturing expansion  as well as additional outside sources of products 
the company believes its financial position will provide sufficient funds should an appropriate investment opportunity arise and thereby  assist the company in improving customer satisfaction and in maintaining or increasing market share 
based upon plans for new product introductions  product mixes  capacity restraints on certain product lines and equipment upgrades  the company expects that year capital expenditures for the manufacturing facilities will be in excess of the million spent in inflation did not have a material effect on net sales or net income in fiscal years through a significant increase in inflation could affect future performance

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk 
the company faces exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily in asia 
the company s foreign currency risk may change over time as the level of activity in foreign markets grows and could have an adverse impact upon the company s financial results 
certain of the company s assets  including certain bank accounts and accounts receivable  and liabilities exist in non us dollar denominated currencies  which are sensitive to foreign currency exchange fluctuations 
these currencies are principally the chinese yuan  the taiwanese dollar  the japanese yen  and the hong kong dollar 
because of the relatively small size of each individual currency exposure  the company does not employ hedging techniques designed to mitigate foreign currency exposures 
therefore  the company could experience currency gains and losses 
interest rate risk 
the company has credit agreements with us and far east financial institutions at interest rates equal to libor or similar indices plus a negotiated margin 
a rise in interest rates could have an adverse impact upon the company s cost of working capital and its interest expense 
the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement to hedge its exposure to variability in expected future cash flows resulting from interest rate risk related to a portion of its long term debt 
the interest rate swap agreement applies to million of the company s long term debt at december  and expires november  the swap contract is inversely correlated to the related hedged long term debt and is therefore considered an effective cash flow hedge of the underlying long term debt 
the level of effectiveness of the hedge is measured by the changes in the market value of the hedged long term debt resulting from fluctuation in interest rates
