item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company  including the notes thereto  included elsewhere in this document 
overview the company designs  develops  markets and supports portable  software driven  measurement systems that are used in a broad range of manufacturing and industrial applications 
the company s principal products are the control station and the control station pro measuring devices and their companion soft check tool and cam software  respectively  which provide for cad based inspection and factory level statistical process control 
together  these products integrate the measurement and quality inspection function with cad software to improve productivity  enhance product quality and decrease rework and scrap in the manufacturing process 
the company s products bring precision measurement  quality inspection and specification conformance capabilities  integrated with leading cad software  to the factory floor 
the company is a pioneer in the development and marketing of d measurement technology in manufacturing and industrial applications and currently holds patents 
the company s products have been purchased by approximately  customers worldwide  ranging from small machine shops to such large manufacturing and industrial companies as audi  bell helicopter  boeing  british aerospace  caterpillar  daimlerchrysler  general electric  general motors  honda  johnson controls  komatsu dresser  lockheed martin  siemens and volkswagen among many others 
from its inception in through  the company focused on providing computerized  d measurement devices to the orthopedic and neurosurgical markets 
during this period  the company introduced a knee laxity measurement device  a diagnostic tool for measuring posture  scoliosis and back flexibility  and a surgical guidance device utilizing a six axis articulated arm 
in  in an effort to capitalize on a demand for d portable measurement tools for the factory floor  the company made a strategic decision to target its core measurement technology to the manufacturing and industrial markets 
in order to focus on manufacturing and industrial applications of its technology  the company phased out the direct sale of its medical products and entered into licensing agreements with two major neurosurgical companies for its medical technology 
since  the company has entered into additional licensing agreements for the use of its technology for medical applications 
prior to the company accounted for royalty revenues from these licensing agreements as other income 
in  the company reclassified royalty revenues from other income to sales on the basis that the licensing of technology is consistent with the company s main business of d measurement 
in  the company made a strategic decision to target international markets 
the company established sales offices in france and germany in  great britain in  japan and spain in and italy in international sales represented   and of sales in   and  respectively 
the company derives revenues primarily from the sale of its measurement equipment  and its related multi faceted soft check tool and cam software 
revenue related to these products is recognized upon shipment 
going forward  the company expects to generate an increasing percentage of its revenue from the sale of its laser tracker product 
historically  the company s sales growth has resulted from increased unit sales due to an expanded sales effort that included the addition of sales personnel and expanded promotional efforts 
in  the company introduced the control station with softcheck tools  new accessory items such as the faro rail  the faro powerhouse and new versions of all the members of the cam software family 
in january  the company acquired spatialmetrix corporation smx  a leading manufacturer and supplier of laser trackers and metrology software 
the new generation laser tracker is a high accuracy  portable dimensional measurement technology 
in addition to providing a one year basic warranty without additional charge  the company offers its customers one and three year extended maintenance contracts  which include on line help services  software upgrades and hardware warranties 
in addition  the company sells training and technology consulting services relating to its products 
the company recognizes the revenue from extended maintenance contracts proportionately  in the same manner as costs are incurred for such revenues 
cost of sales consists primarily of material  production overhead and labor 
selling expenses consist primarily of salaries and commissions to sales and marketing personnel  and promotion  advertising  travel and telecommunications 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries for administrative personnel  rent  utilities and professional and legal expenses 
research and development expenses represent salaries  equipment and third party services 
accounting for wholly owned foreign subsidiaries is maintained in the currency of the respective foreign jurisdiction and  therefore  fluctuations in exchange rates may have an impact on intercompany accounts reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements 
in the normal course of business  the company from time to time employs off balance sheet financial instruments to hedge its exposure to foreign currency exchange rates  including cross currency swaps  forward contracts  and foreign currency options see foreign exchange exposure below 
during fiscal years and  the company s sales growth has been adversely affected by the economic slowdown currently affecting the united states and europe 
this effect  however  was partially offset by sales growth resulting from the acquisition of smx in january in the company adopted a cost reduction plan  which continued into this plan included reducing discretionary spending  canceling certain non strategic product developments  and a reduction of the company s existing us workforce  primarily in administration  research and development  and manufacturing 
new products the company commenced shipments of its new generation laser tracker product line late in the third quarter of the company also released a new generation of its faroarm production under the names platinum and titanium 
the arms replace previous generation arms that were released in the company expects the new generation arms to allow the company to maintain its market leadership in this segment of the portable measure market 
manufacture of both the new generation laser trackers and the new generation portable measurement arms involve both new and distinct manufacturing designs as well as innovative production processes when compared to the company s previous product offering

gross margins on sales are expected to ultimately meet or exceed the company s historic levels once both production facilities are at full production levels 
plant capacity utilization is expected to increase with additional manufacturing efficiencies expected in selling expenses 
selling expenses increased by  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was a result of higher sales commissions on higher sales in the us million and higher expenses in japan  offset largely by cost reduction measures implemented in the united states  and europe 
while an increase in total expenses was experienced in compared to  this amount represents a decrease in the percentage of sales from in to in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by million or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase was due to administrative expenses resulting from the integration of the former smx in  professional fees unrelated to smx  a provision for doubtful accounts receivable  recorded in the second quarter of related to the recently acquired laser product line  and a shifting of personnel from research and development to administrative positions 
depreciation and amortization expenses

research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased by  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  principally as a result of research and development expenses of the new laser tracker product line million offset in part by lower expenses for the new generation arm development in the us  and shifting of personnel to administrative positions costs in europe  see general and administrative expenses above 
interest income 
interest income decreased by  or  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily attributable to lower interest bearing cash balances see liquidity and capital resources below and lower interest rates prevailing in other income loss

income tax expense 
income tax expense decreased by  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  net loss

depreciation and amortization expenses 
depreciation and amortization expenses decreased by  or  from million in to million in primarily as a result of assets becoming fully amortized in research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased by  or  from million in to million in the decrease was due to decline across many expense categories in europe  and the translation effect of the stronger us dollar in  on the european r d expenses  offset in part by increase across many expense categories in the united states 
interest income 
interest income increased by  from  in to  in primarily as a result of higher average principal amounts invested in  including loans to smx see liquidity and capital resources below 
other income  net 
net expenses decreased by  from  in to  in the decrease resulted principally from lower foreign exchange losses in europe in income tax expense 
income tax expense decreased by  from  in to  in the net tax expense resulted from an increase in the valuation allowance for the company s us deferred income tax assets offset by benefits realized by the utilization of german net operating loss carryforwards which were previously reserved 
at december  the company has deferred income tax assets of approximately million including million related to the us operations and million related to foreign operations which are offset by a valuation allowance of approximately million 
these deferred income tax assets are primarily attributable to net operating loss carryforwards and intangible assets for which future income tax benefits may be realized 
net income loss 
the company s net income loss decreased by million  from net income of  in to a loss of million in to due to the factors mentioned above 
acquisition of smx on january   the company acquired spatialmetrix corporation smx  a leading manufacturer and supplier of laser trackers and targets  metrology software and contract inspection services  in exchange for  shares of faro common stock  shares of which are being held in escrow and the satisfaction by the company of certain obligations of smx 
in connection therewith  the company issued an additional  shares of faro common stock and paid million in cash to fully satisfy smx s obligations to its two lenders 
the company also assumed and or satisfied other obligations of smx  including approximately million in financing provided by the company to smx prior to january  the company estimates that smx had of the installed laser tracker market 
the company exercised its contractual right to acquire smx only after the successful design by smx of a new generation laser tracker  which the company sells at competitive prices compared to both the previous generation smx tracker  and competitor s current products 
smx s previous generation laser tracker  which was introduced in  was sold until september smx halted production and sale of its earlier generation laser tracker in september the operations of the new laser product line are contributing favorably to the company s revenue growth and  beginning in the third quarter of  results of operations 
the company sold approximately million in laser products and services in and expects to continue to ramp up sales of the laser tracker in the operating expenses of the new laser product line are  beginning in the third quarter of  consistent with the company s historic operating expense ratios 
liquidity and capital resources since  the company has financed its operations primarily from cash provided by operating activities and from the proceeds of its initial public offering of common stock approximately million 
total marketable securities cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and investments at december  were million  compared to million at december  this significant million reduction is primarily due to the acquisition of smx in january and the related operating expenses for the year ending december  we believe that our working capital  together with anticipated cash flow from our operations  will be sufficient to fund our long term liquidity requirements 
our liquidity is not dependant upon the use of off balance sheet financing arrangements  such as scrutinization of receivables or obtaining access to assets through special purpose entities 
for the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities was million compared to  in net cash used in operating activities was from increases in accounts receivable and inventories million and a decrease in accounts payable million offset by net profit before depreciation  and provisions for expenses million and other items million 
net cash used by investing activities for the year ended december  was  compared to net cash provided of  in the change in investing activities was due primarily to the acquisition of smx 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million compared to  in in a line of credit was utilized in the amount of million 
the company invests excess balances in short term investment grade securities  such as money market investments  obligations of the us government and its agencies  and obligations of state and local governmental agencies 
on january   in connection with its acquisition of smx  the company issued  shares of faro common stock and satisfied certain obligations of smx 
additionally  the company issued an additional  shares of faro common stock and paid million in cash to fully satisfy smx s obligations to its two lenders see acquisition of smx above 
the company also assumed and or settled other obligations of smx  including approximately million in financing provided by the company to smx prior to january  the company recently commenced shipments of its new generation laser tracker product line and released a new generation platinum and titanium advanced portable measure arm products see new products above 
manufacture of both the new generation laser trackers and the new generation portable measure arms involve new and distinct manufacturing designs  and production processes  when compared to the company s previous product offering 
plant capacity utilization is expected to increase with additional manufacturing efficiencies expected in the fourth quarter 
the company s principal commitments at december  consisted of leases on its headquarters and regional offices see contractual obligations and commercial commitments below 
there were no material commitments for capital expenditures at that date 
the company believes that its cash  investments and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to satisfy its working capital and capital expenditure needs at least through contractual obligations and commercial commitments the company was a party to a term loan that expires in  capital leases for automotive and other equipment with an initial term of to months and non cancelable operating leases  including leases with related parties see note of notes to consolidated financial statements that expire on or before commitments under these agreements are as follows at december  payments due under total year term loan capital leases operating leases and thereafter total critical accounting policies in response to the sec s financial reporting release  fr  cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we have selected our most subjective accounting estimation processes for purposes of explaining the methodology used in calculating the estimate in addition to any inherent uncertainties pertaining to the estimate and the possible effects on the company s financial condition 
the two accounting estimation processes discussed below are the company s process of recognizing research and development expenditures  and determining the allowances for both obsolete and slow moving inventory and doubtful accounts receivable 
these estimation processes affect current assets and operating results and are therefore critical in assessing the financial and operating status of the company 
these estimates involve certain assumptions that if incorrect could create an adverse impact on the company s operations and financial position 
research and development costs incurred in the discovery of new knowledge and the resulting translation of this new knowledge into plans and designs for new products  prior to the attainment of the related products technological feasibility  are recorded as expenses in the period incurred 
product design costs incurred in the development of products after technological feasibility is attained are capitalized and amortized using the straight line method over the estimated economic lives of the related products  not to exceed years 
the company considers technological feasibility to be established when the company has completed all planning  designing  coding and testing activities that are necessary to establish design specifications including function  features and technical performance requirements 
capitalization of product design costs ceases and amortization of such costs begins when the product is available for general release to customers 
the company periodically assesses the value of capitalized product design costs and records a write down for impairment when  in the circumstances including the discontinuance or probable discontinuance of the related products from the market  it deems the asset to be obsolete or impaired 
the reserve for obsolete and slow moving inventory was   and  at december   and  respectively 
the reserve for obsolete and slow moving inventory is used to state the company s inventories at the lower of average cost or net realizable value 
since the amount of inventorial cost that the company will truly recoup through sales cannot be known with exact certainty  the company relies on past sales experience and future sales forecasts 
inventory is considered as obsolete if the company has withdrawn it from the market or if the company has had no sales of the product for the past months nor sales forecasted for the next months  therefore an allowance in an amount equal to of the average cost of such inventory is recorded 
the company classifies as slow moving inventory with quantities of on hand greater than the amounts we have sold in the past months or have forecasted to sell in the next months  and reserve such amount as is adequate to reduce the carrying value to net realizable value 
the company performs ongoing evaluations of its customers and adjusts their credit ratings accordingly 
the company continuously monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains a provision for un collectable amounts based on its historical experience and any other issues it has identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within its expectations  the company cannot guarantee this will continue in the future 
the allowances recorded for  and were approximately    and  respectively 
transactions with related and other parties the company leases its headquarters from xenon research  inc xenon  all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of which is owned by simon raab  the company s president and chief executive officer  and diana raab  his spouse 
the term of the lease expires on february   and the company has two five year renewal options 
base rent under the lease was  for base rent during renewal periods will reflect changes in the us bureau of labor statistics consumer price index for all urban consumers 
in june  the company and each of the former cats shareholders entered into an amended and restated loan agreement pursuant to which the company granted loans to the former shareholders of cats gmbh in the aggregate amount of million the loans 
the loans were made to fund the tax obligations incurred by the former cats shareholders in connection with the company s acquisition of cats gmbh in the company agreed to the terms of the loans are part of the acquisition agreement for cats gmbh 
the loans are for a term of three years  at an interest rate of approximately  and grant the borrowers an option to extend the term for an additional three years 
as collateral for the loans  the former cats shareholders pledged to the company  shares of the company s common stock 
the loans are a non recourse obligation of the former cats shareholders 
the company engaged cole partners  a mergers and acquisition and corporate finance advisory service firm  to serve as the company s financial advisor in connection with the company s acquisition in january  of spatialmetrix  inc stephen r 
cole  one of the company s directors and member of the audit committee  is the founding partner and president of cole partners 
the company paid to cole partners total fees of approximately  for its services  of which  was paid in foreign exchange exposure the company conducts a significant portion of its business outside the united states 
at present  the majority of the company s revenues are invoiced  and a significant portion of its operating expenses paid  in foreign currencies 
fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and such foreign currencies may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition  and could specifically result in foreign exchange gains and losses 
the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on the results of the company s operations cannot be accurately predicted 
to the extent that the percentage of the company s non us dollar revenues derived from international sales increases in the future  the company s exposure to risks associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates will increase further 
see additional discussion under impact of recently issued accounting standards below 
inflation the company believes that inflation has not had a material impact on its results of operations in recent years and does not expect inflation to have a material impact on its operations in conversion to the euro on january   certain member countries of the european union adopted the euro as their national currency 
the transition period for the introduction of the euro ended june  the adoption of the euro did not have a material effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations

sfas requires companies to recognize all their derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the statement of position 
in september  the company entered into a foreign exchange rate swap allowing the company the right to purchase up to million at a base rate of euros per 
under the agreement  the company and the bank are to compensate one another based on the exchange rate agreement differential at specified measurement dates 
this foreign exchange rate agreement does not qualify for special hedge accounting treatment  as it does not meet the specified criteria under sfas therefore the changes in fair value are included in the determination of earnings 
in june  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets statement  was issued stating that indefinite life identifiable intangible assets and goodwill are not amortized 
the company periodically reviews its identifiable assets and goodwill  considering factors such as projected cash flows and revenue and earnings multiples  to determine whether the value of the assets are impaired and the amortization periods are appropriate 
if an asset is impaired  the difference between the value of the asset reflected on the financial statements and its current fair value is recognized as an expense in the period in which the impairment occurs 
goodwill is impaired when the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the reporting unit

 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when a liability is incurred rather than when an exit or disposal plan is approved 
we are required to adopt the provisions of sfas for any exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the effect of adoption of sfas will be a change on a prospective basis of the timing of when restructuring charges are recorded from a commitment date approach to when a liability is recorded 
the company does not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on its financial statements or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the disclosure requirements of this interpretation are effective for interim and annual periods after december  the initial recognition and initial measurement requirements of this interpretation are effective prospectively for guarantees issued or modified after december  the interpretation s expanded disclosures will not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in november  the eitf reached a consensus on issue  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements eitf 
eitf addresses how to account for arrangements that may involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services  and or rights to use assets 
the consensus mandates how to identify whether goods or services or both that are to be delivered separately in a bundled sales arrangement should be accounted for separately because they are separate units of accounting 
the guidance can affect the timing of revenue recognition for such arrangements  even though it does not change rules governing the timing or pattern of revenue recognition of individual items accounted for separately 
the final consensus will be applicable to agreements entered into in fiscal years beginning after june  with early adoption permitted 
additionally  companies will be permitted to apply the consensus guidance to all existing arrangements as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in accordance with apb opinion no
