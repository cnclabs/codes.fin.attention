item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that are subject to many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ significantly from expectations 
for more information on forward looking statements  refer to the special note on forward looking statements at the front of this annual report on form k 
our products have historically centered on fax and print servers and related technologies 
starting in  our revenues have declined as competition increased  primarily with the print server products in the asia pacific region  while at the same time the internet and other networking technologies advanced 
as a result  we experienced annual operating losses beginning in through we redirected our efforts to focus on server appliances and on development efforts to integrate existing and future products with the internet and emerging networking technologies 
we introduced our new products  the faxpress in february  faxpress in november  faxpress sbe in february  the faxpress in september and a major release of our faxpress software in november through mainly the release of these enhanced products in the fax messaging family and continuous efforts in product cost reductions  our gross profit margins improved from in to in on march   we received a notice from the nasdaq stock market that our common stock had failed to maintain the minimum bid price of per share required for continued listing on the nasdaq smallcap market 
on november   we were granted a temporary exception to nasdaq s minimum bid price requirement  subject to us meeting certain conditions during the term of the exception 
on december   our common stock bid price closed at per share and since then the bid price has closed above 
on january   we received a letter from the nasdaq stating that we have demonstrated full compliance with the nasdaq qualifications exception issued to us on november  in the fourth quarter of  our board of directors authorized us  from time to time  to repurchase at market prices  up to million shares of our common stock for cash in open market  negotiated or block transactions 
the timing of such transactions has depended and will depend on market conditions  other corporate strategies and has been and will be at the discretion of our management 
no time limit was set for the completion of this program 
as of december   we have repurchased from open market and negotiated transactions a total of million shares for million  representing an average per share price of additionally  improved cash management resulted in positive operating cash flows in and despite the use of million of cash  including legal and professional fees of  to repurchase our common stock in open market and negotiated transactions following the announcement of our stock repurchase program in october  cash balances at december  remained at million  as compared to million at the end of critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and to the understanding of our results of operations 
we have defined a critical accounting policy as one that is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requires our management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
the impact of any risks associated with these policies on our business operations is discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k  beginning on page f note that preparation of this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
estimates about future events and their effects cannot be made with certainty 
we based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue based on the provisions of staff accounting bulletin sab no 
revenue recognition in financial statements and statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revenue recognition when right of return exists 
product revenue is recognized upon shipment if a signed contract or purchase order exists  the fee is fixed and determinable  collection of the resulting receivable is probable and product returns are reasonably estimable 
shipment generally occurs and title is transferred when product is delivered to a common carrier 
we enter into agreements with some of our distributors which permit limited stock rotation rights 
these stock rotation rights allow the distributor to return products for credit but require the purchase of additional products of equal value 
customers who purchase our products directly from us also have limited return rights  which expire days from product shipment 
revenues subject to stock rotation rights are reduced by our estimates of anticipated exchanges 
we establish our reserve for sales returns for distributors based on historic return rates from these distributors 
if the historical data used by the company to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future returns  these estimates could be revised 
pursuant to our agreements with distributors  we also protect our distributors exposure related to the impact of price reductions 
price adjustments are recorded at the time price reductions are communicated to the company s distributors 
revenue for transactions that include multiple elements such as hardware and post contract customer support is allocated to each element based on its relative fair value and recognized for each element when the revenue recognition criteria have been met for such element 
fair value is generally determined based on the price charged when the element is sold separately 
we recognize revenue from the sale of extended warranty contracts ratably over the period of the contracts 
we recognize royalty income on the sale of lanpress products by a japanese distributor 
royalties are not recognized as revenue until the products are sold by the distributor 
distributor programs and incentives we record estimated reductions to revenues for distributor programs and incentive offerings including special pricing agreements  trade in credits  promotions and other volume based incentives 
if market conditions were to change  we may take actions to increase distributor incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenues at the time the incentive is offered 
warranty provisions for estimated warranty costs are recorded at the time products are shipped as a charge to cost of sales 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should product failure rates  material usage or service delivery cost differ from our estimates  revision to the estimated warranty liability would be required  which could affect the amount of gross profit reported 
credit  collection and allowance for doubtful accounts we perform ongoing customer credit evaluations based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
when credit criteria are not met  we require cash on delivery or payment by credit card before products are shipped 
on a quarterly basis  we specifically analyze accounts receivable  potential returns  historical bad debts  customer concentration  and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts and for potential returns 
such returns and losses have generally been within our expectations 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
three customers accounted for and of accounts receivable at december  and  respectively 
inventories and related allowance for obsolete and excess inventory inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost which approximates cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
inventories are reduced by an allowance for excess and obsolete inventories 
the estimated allowance is based on management s review of inventories on hand on a quarterly basis  compared to management s assumptions about future demand  market conditions and anticipated timing of the release of product upgrades or next generation products 
if actual market conditions for future demand are less favorable than those projected by us or if product upgrades or next general products are released earlier than anticipated  additional inventory write downs may be required 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with the liability method 
under the liability method  deferred assets and liabilities are recognized based upon anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
the provision for income taxes is comprised of the current tax liability and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the company establishes a valuation allowance to the extent that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be recoverable against future taxable income 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and net sales net sales consist of product sales  which are calculated net of returns and allowances  to distributors and end users 
sales of products to end users are recognized upon shipment and reduced by our estimates of anticipated returns 
sales of products to distributors who have limited stock rotation rights are also recognized upon shipment  but are reduced by our estimates of anticipated exchanges and returns 
revenue from the sale of extended warranty contracts is recognized ratably over the period of the contracts 
net sales increased to million in from million in the increase of  in net sales resulted primarily from an increase in sales of our faxpress fax server products of  million to the domestic channels  offset partially by a decrease in our print server product sales of  to international markets 
domestic sales were million in as compared to million in  representing and  respectively  of total net sales 
international sales were million in as compared to million in  representing and  respectively  of total net sales 
lower international sales were largely due to reduced demand for our print server products in the asia pacific region 
most of our international sales are denominated in us dollars and thus could be adversely affected by changes in demand resulting from fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
in  ingram micro  tech data and macnica  the company s top three customers accounted for approximately of our net sales 
in  the same three distributors accounted for of net sales 
cost of sales  gross profit gross profit is equal to net sales less cost of sales 
cost of sales includes cost of materials  including components  manuals  diskettes  packaging materials and shipping 
cost of sales also includes compensation costs and overhead related to the company s manufacturing operations  obsolescence and warranty expenses 
gross profit was million  or of net sales  in  compared to million  or of net sales  in efficiencies realized from the restructuring in  continuous product cost reductions in  outsourcing of manufacturing and the increasingly favorable mix from the sales of our fax server products  which have higher gross profit  contributed to the improvement in gross profit in research and development research and development expenses represent costs associated with the development of new products and consist primarily of employee related expenses  material costs and allocated facility costs 
research and product development expenses were million in  compared to million in  and represented and of net sales for those periods  respectively 
the lower research and development expenses in were mostly due to lower support costs of  and reduced use of outside consulting  resulting in a savings of  research and development spending has supported existing products and the development of new server appliances 
we remain committed to the development of highly competitive new products and services through the efficient utilization of our engineering resources 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses  commissions to sales representatives  product promotion expenses  and allocated facilities expenses  including expenses associated with our regional sales and support offices 
sales and marketing expenses were million and million for and  respectively  and represented and of net sales for those periods 
the reduction in sales and marketing expenses was largely due to a reduction in personnel related costs of  which was partly realized from the restructuring in and lower product promotional expenses of  offset in part by higher support costs of  general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee related expenses for administration  finance  human resources and general management  as well as consulting  outside services  legal and accounting expenses  and allocated facilities expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million and million for and  respectively  or and of net sales for those periods 
the increase in expenses in was mostly due to higher legal expenses of  and outside consulting expenses of  which were chiefly attributable to our stock repurchase and nasdaq listing issues 
increased accounting fees of  compensation to board of directors of  investor relations expenses of  and the absence of benefit obtained from the collection of bad debts written off in of  also contributed to the higher general and administrative expenses in restructuring expenses in april  we terminated regular  temporary and contractor positions  which constituted approximately of our workforce 
this action resulted in a restructuring charge of  in in the second quarter of  a non recurring benefit of  arising from the reversal of previously recorded restructuring charges was included in the results of operations  following the completion of our restructuring program for less than previously anticipated

the decrease in other income in when compared to primarily reflected lower interest income of  due to the decline in interest rates during and miscellaneous income of  offset in part by lower bank fees of  provision for income tax in fiscal  our provision for income taxes was  representing state income taxes 
the tax provision for federal income taxes was offset by the utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards 
in fiscal  we incurred a loss and there were no substantial federal nor state income taxes recognized 
comparison of years ended december  and net sales net sales decreased to million in from million in the decline of million in net sales resulted primarily from lower sales of our fax on demand products of million and fax server products of  or  in the domestic channel and a decrease of our print server products of million mainly due to customers in the asia pacific region 
these declines were in part attributable to the industry wide slowdown in the economy 
domestic sales were million in as compared to million in  representing and  respectively  of total net sales for and  respectively 
international sales were million in as compared to million in  representing and  respectively  of total net sales 
lower international sales were largely due to reduced demand for our print server products in the asia pacific region

sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses were million and million for and  respectively  and represented and of net sales for those periods 
the reduction in sales and marketing expenses compared to was largely due to a reduction in personnel related costs of  which was partly realized from the restructuring  lower product promotional expenses of  reduced outside consulting expenses of  other occupancy related costs of  and the netting of  of expenses against sales following the implementation of eitf general administrative general and administrative expenses were million and million for and  respectively  or and of net sales for those periods 
the decrease in expenses in was mostly due to lower outside consulting expenses of  lower bad debt expense of  reduced recruiting expense of  and other occupancy related costs of  restructuring expenses in response to the continuing economic slowdown and decrease in demand for our products  we terminated regular  temporary and contractor positions in april  which constituted approximately of our workforce 
this action resulted in a restructuring charge of  in the restructuring included an asset write off and other direct expenses associated with the consolidation of our operations in the united kingdom and el dorado hills  california 
of the total restructuring charge of  approximately  represented cash charges   represented non cash charges related to the write down of excess fixed assets from the consolidation of our united kingdom and el dorado hills operations  and  denoted obligations in mainly for costs associated with remaining obligations related to our united kingdom office and the final severance payment to an employee

the increase in other income in when compared to reflected mostly higher miscellaneous income of  provision for income taxes in fiscal  we incurred a loss and there were no substantial federal nor state income taxes recognized 
in fiscal  our provision for incomes taxes was  representing state income taxes 
our federal income tax provision was offset by the utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards 
liquidity and capital resources since our initial public offering of common stock in december  our principal source of funding has been cash from our operations  with some funding from capital equipment lease lines 
as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  a decrease of million from december  the decrease in cash and cash equivalents in was primarily attributable to the use of million  including legal and professional fees of  in the fourth quarter of to repurchase our stock  offset partially by an improvement in cash inflows from operating activities of  in december  as a source of capital asset financing  we entered into a loan and security agreement with a finance company for an amount of  this loan is subject to interest of and is repayable by december as of december   the future minimum payments are  in april  as a source of capital asset financing  we entered into a loan and security agreement with a finance company for an amount of  this loan is subject to interest of and is repayable by april as of december   the future minimum payments are  the company has entered into noncancelable operating leases that expire at various stages ending in  and is responsible for certain maintenance costs  taxes and insurance under the leases 
in august  the company entered into a lease for a new facility in morgan hill  california and relocated its corporate headquarters in december after the lease at the santa clara  california location expired 
the lease on the new facility has a term of years  expiring in december with one conditional three year option  which if exercised would extend the lease to december commencing with rent at ninety five percent of fair market value 
the following represents combined aggregate maturities for all the company s financing and commitments as of december  capital lease total commitments year ended december  operating leases obligations total commitments in addition to the commitments shown above  we have a million secured revolving line of credit with a bank  which expires in march  pursuant to which we may borrow against pledges of cash at the bank s prime rate at december  
borrowings under this line of credit agreement are collateralized by all of our assets 
under the agreement  the company must comply with certain financial and other covenants 
as of december   the company was in compliance with these covenants and there were no borrowings outstanding under the line of credit 
net cash provided by operations in was  as compared to  in the increase was largely a result of sales increases  improving operational efficiencies and cost reductions  offset in part by moderate inventory increases 
net cash used in financing activities of million in was largely for the repurchase of our stock and the professional fees associated with such repurchase 
we acquired additional property and equipment of   and  in   and  respectively 
the spending on property and equipment in and was largely a reflection of the investment in leasehold improvements in our new corporate headquarters  and excluded capital equipment of  and  respectively  purchased through equipment leases in and we believe that our existing cash balances  anticipated cash flows from operations and available lines of credit will be sufficient to meet our anticipated capital requirements for the next months 
if we have a need for additional capital resources  we may be required to sell additional equity or debt securities  secure additional lines of credit or obtain other third party financing 
the timing and amount of such capital requirements cannot be determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors  including demand for our existing and new products  if any  and changes in technology in the networking industry 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available on satisfactory terms when needed  if at all 
failure to raise such additional financing  if needed  may result in our inability to achieve our long term business objectives 
to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities would result in additional dilution to our shareholders 
in addition  because of our dependency on a small number of distributors for a significant portion of the sales of our products  the loss of any of our major distributors or their inability to satisfy their payment obligations to us could have a significant adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
risk factors shareholders or investors considering the purchase of shares of the our common stock should carefully consider the following risk factors  in addition to other information in this annual report on form k 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations 
our revenue and operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future  particularly on a quarterly basis 
our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to many factors  some of which are outside our control 
for example  the following conditions could all affect our results o changes in our product sales and customer mix  o constraints in our manufacturing and assembling operations  o shortages or increases in the prices of raw materials and components  o changes in pricing policy by us or our competitors  o a slowdown in the growth of the networking market  o seasonality  o timing of expenditures  and o economic conditions in the united states  europe and asia 
our sales often reflect orders shipped in the same quarter in which they are received 
in addition  significant portions of our expenses are relatively fixed in nature  and planned expenditures are based primarily on sales forecasts 
therefore  if the company inaccurately forecasts demand for our products  the impact on net income may be magnified by the company s inability to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for the net sales shortfall 
other factors contributing to fluctuations in our quarterly operating results include o changes in the demand for our products  o customer order deferrals in anticipation of new versions of our products  o the introduction of new products and product enhancements by us or our competitors  o the effects of filling the distribution channels following introductions of new products and product enhancements  o potential delays in the availability of announced or anticipated products  o the mix of product and service revenue  the commencement or conclusion of significant development contracts  o changes in foreign currency exchange rates  and o the timing of significant marketing and sales promotions 
based on the foregoing  we believe that quarterly operating results are likely to vary significantly in the future and that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be viewed as indications of future performance 
we have a history of losses and may not be able to sustain profitability 
we have experienced significant operating losses and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of million 
our development and marketing of current and new products will continue to require substantial expenditures 
we incurred  of losses in due to a slowdown in demand for our products due in part to an industry wide adverse economic condition 
we were able to recover and have been profitable since the third quarter of  with a total net income of  in there can be no assurance that growth in net sales will be achieved or profitability sustained in future years 
our common stock is listed on the nasdaq smallcap market  and we have had difficulty satisfying the listing criteria to avoid the delisting of our common stock our common stock has been listed on the nasdaq smallcap market since april in order to maintain our listing on the nasdaq smallcap market  we must maintain total assets  capital and public float at specified levels  and our common stock generally must maintain a minimum bid price of per share 
if we fail to maintain the standards necessary to be quoted on the nasdaq smallcap market  our common stock could become subject to delisting 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the minimum bid price per share of our common stock and thus maintain our listing on the nasdaq smallcap market 
if our common stock is delisted  trading in our common stock could be conducted on the otc bulletin board or in the over the counter market in what is commonly referred to as the pink sheets 
if this occurs  a shareholder will find it more difficult to dispose of our common stock or to obtain accurate quotations as to the price of our common stock 
lack of any active trading market would have an adverse effect on a shareholder s ability to liquidate an investment in our common stock easily and quickly at a reasonable price 
it might also contribute to volatility in the market price of our common stock and could adversely affect our ability to raise additional equity or debt financing on acceptable terms or at all 
failure to obtain desired financing on acceptable terms could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
substantially all of our revenue comes from the sale of fax and print server products  and a decline in demand for those products would harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
we derive substantially all of our revenue from the sale of fax and print server products  with fax server products accounting for of total sales in we expect that our current products will continue to account for most of our sales in the near future 
a decline in demand for our fax and print server products as a result of competition  technological change or other factors  or a delay in the development and market acceptance of new features and products  would have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we sell our products through a limited number of distributors  and any deterioration in our relationship with those distributors would harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
we sell our products primarily through a two tier domestic and international distribution network 
our distributors sell our products to vars  e commerce vendors and other resellers 
the distribution of personal computers and networking products has been characterized by rapid change  including consolidations due to the financial difficulties of distributors and the emergence of alternative distribution channels 
an increasing number of companies are competing for access to these channels 
our distributors typically represent other products that are complementary to  or compete with  our products 
in particular  certain of our competitors  including hewlett packard and intel  sell a substantially higher dollar volume of products through several of our large us distributors  and as a result  we believe these distributors give higher priority to products offered by our competitors 
our distributors are not contractually committed to future purchases of our products and could discontinue carrying our products at any time for any reason 
in addition  because we are dependent on a small number of distributors for a significant portion of the sales of our products  the loss of any of our major distributors or their inability to satisfy their payment obligations to us could have a significant adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we have a stock rotation policy with certain of our distributors that allows them to return marketable inventory against offsetting orders 
if we reduce our prices  we credit certain distributors for the difference between the purchase price of products remaining in their inventory and our reduced price for these products 
in addition  inventory levels of our products held by distributors could become excessive due to industry conditions or the actions of competitors  resulting in product returns and inventory write downs 
the market for our products is affected by rapidly changing technology and if we fail to predict and respond to customers changing needs  our business  operating results and financial condition may suffer 
the market for our products is affected by rapidly changing networking technology  evolving industry standards and the emergence of the internet and other new communication technologies 
we believe that our future success will depend upon our ability to enhance our existing products and to identify  develop  manufacture and introduce new products which o conform to or support emerging network telecommunications standards  o are compatible with a growing array of computer and peripheral devices  o support popular computer and network operating systems and applications  o meet a wide range of evolving user needs  and o achieve market acceptance 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts 
we have incurred  and expect to continue to incur  substantial expenses associated with the introduction and promotion of new products 
there can be no assurance that the expenses incurred will not exceed research and development cost estimates or that new products will achieve market acceptance and generate sales sufficient to offset development costs 
in order to develop new products successfully  we are dependent upon timely access to information about new technological developments and standards 
there can be no assurance that we will have such access or will be able to develop new products successfully and respond effectively to technological change or new product announcements by others 
we expect that printer and other peripheral manufacturers will add features to their products that make them more network accessible  which may reduce demand for our print servers 
there can be no assurance that products or technologies developed by others will not render our products non competitive or obsolete 
the fax on demand market in general has been negatively affected by the growth of the internet 
although we have new web fax email products in development  there can be no assurance these products will compete successfully 
complex products such as those offered by us may contain undetected or unresolved hardware defects or software errors when they are first introduced or as new versions are released 
changes in our or our suppliers manufacturing processes or the inadvertent use of defective components could adversely affect our ability to achieve acceptable manufacturing yields and product reliability 
we have in the past discovered hardware defects and software errors in certain of our new products and enhancements after their introduction 
there can be no assurance that despite testing by us and by third party test sites  errors will not be found in future releases of our products  which would result in adverse product reviews and negatively affect market acceptance of these products 
the introduction of new or enhanced products requires us to manage the transition from the older products to the new or enhanced products or versions  both internally and for customers 
we must manage new product introductions so as to minimize disruption in customer ordering patterns  avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and ensure that adequate supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customer demands 
we have from time to time experienced delays in the shipment of new products 
there can be no assurance that we will successfully manage future product transitions 
our success depends upon the continued contributions of our key management  marketing  product development and operational personnel 
our success will depend  to a large extent  upon our ability to retain and continue to attract highly skilled personnel in management  marketing  product development and operations 
competition for employees in the computer and electronics industries is intense  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain enough qualified employees 
volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price may also adversely affect our ability to retain and continue to attract key employees  many of whom have been granted stock options 
our inability to retain and attract key employees could have a material adverse effect on our product development  business  operating results and financial condition 
we do not carry key person life insurance with respect to any of our personnel 
the markets for our products are highly competitive and may become more competitive in the future 
the network enhancement products and computer software markets are highly competitive  and we believe that competition will intensify in the future 
the competition is characterized by rapid change and improvements in technology along with constant pressure to reduce the prices of products 
we currently compete principally in the market for network fax servers and network print servers and fax on demand software 
both direct and indirect competition could adversely affect our business and operating results through pricing pressure  loss of market share and other factors 
in particular  we expect that  over time  average selling prices for our print server products will continue to decline  as the market for these products becomes increasingly competitive 
any material reduction in the average selling prices of our products would adversely affect gross margins 
there can be no assurance we will be able to maintain the current average selling prices of our products or the related gross margins 
the principal competitive factors affecting the market for our products include o product functionality  o performance  o quality  o reliability  o ease of use  o quality of customer training and support  o name recognition  o price  and o compatibility and conformance with industry standards and changing operating system environments 
several of our existing and potential competitors  most notably hewlett packard and intel  have substantially greater financial  engineering  manufacturing and marketing resources than us 
we also experience competition from a number of other software  hardware and service companies 
in addition to our current competitors  we may face substantial competition from new entrants into the network enhancement market  including established and emerging computer  computer peripheral  communications and software companies 
in the fax server market we compete with companies such as captaris inc  omtool  ltd 
and computer associates international  inc there can be no assurance that competitors will not introduce products incorporating technology more advanced than the technology used by us in our products 
in addition  certain competing methods of communications such as the internet or electronic mail could adversely affect the market for fax products 
certain of our existing and potential competitors in the print server market are manufacturers of printers and other peripherals  and these competitors may develop closed systems accessible only through their own proprietary servers 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully or that competition will not have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we depend on sales in foreign markets  and political or economic changes in these markets could affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
sales to customers located outside canada and the united states accounted for approximately  and of our net sales in  and  respectively 
we sell our products in approximately foreign countries through approximately international distributors 
our principal japanese distributor accounted for approximately  and of our international sales in  and  respectively  and  and of our total net sales in  and  respectively 
we expect that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of our product revenues and that we will be subject to the normal risks of international sales  such as export laws  currency fluctuations  longer payment cycles  greater difficulties in accounts receivable collections and the requirement of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws 
there can be no assurance that we will not experience difficulties resulting from changes in foreign laws relating to the export of our products in the future 
in addition  because we primarily invoice foreign sales in us dollars  fluctuations in exchange rates could affect demand for our products by causing prices to be out of line with products priced in the local currency 
additionally  any such difficulties would have a material adverse effect on our international sales and a resulting material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
in  we consolidated our operations in the united kingdom and entered into an agreement with a distributor to service the region 
in addition  we entered into a separate agreement in with a japanese distributor to sell our lanpress products in japan  from which we are entitled to receive a royalty on sales of these products 
we may experience fluctuations in european sales on a quarterly basis because european sales may be weaker during the third quarter than the second quarter due to extended holiday shutdowns in july and august 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the level of international sales in the future 
any fluctuations in international sales will greatly affect our operating results and financial condition 
the introduction of new products may reduce the demand for our existing products and increase returns of existing products 
from time to time  we may announce new products  product versions  capabilities or technologies that have the potential to replace or shorten the life cycles of existing products 
the release of a new product or product version may result in the write down of products in inventory if this inventory becomes obsolete 
we have in the past experienced increased returns of a particular product version following the announcement of a planned release of a new version of that product 
there can be no assurance that product returns will not exceed our allowance for these returns in the future and will not have a material adverse effect on the our business  operating results and financial condition 
if we fail to obtain components of our products from third party suppliers and subcontractors  our business could suffer 
our products require components procured from third party suppliers 
some of these components are available only from a single source or from limited sources 
in addition  we subcontract a substantial portion of our manufacturing to third parties  and there can be no assurance that these subcontractors will be able to support our manufacturing requirements 
we purchase components on a purchase order basis  and generally have no long term contracts for these components 
if we are unable to obtain a sufficient supply of high quality components from our current sources  we could experience delays or reductions in product shipments 
furthermore  a significant increase in the price of one or more of these components or our inability to lower component or sub assembly prices in response to competitive price reductions could adversely affect our gross margin 
government regulation could increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect our gross margin 
certain aspects of the networking industry in which we compete are regulated both in the united states and in foreign countries 
imposition of public carrier tariffs  taxation of telecommunications services and the necessity of incurring substantial costs and expenditure of managerial resources to obtain regulatory approvals  or the inability to obtain regulatory approvals within a reasonable period of time  could have a material  adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
this is particularly true in foreign countries where telecommunications standards differ from those in the united states 
our products must comply with a variety of equipment  interface and installation standards promulgated by communications regulatory authorities in different countries 
changes in government policies  regulations and interface standards could require the redesign of products and result in product shipment delays which could have a material  adverse impact on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we depend on proprietary technology  and inability to develop and protect this technology or license it from third parties could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
our success depends to a certain extent upon our technological expertise and proprietary software technology 
we rely upon a combination of contractual rights and copyright  trademark and trade secret laws to establish and protect our technologies 
despite the precautions taken by us  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy our products or to reverse engineer or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries either do not protect our proprietary rights or offer only limited protection 
given the rapid evolution of technology and uncertainties in intellectual property law in the united states and internationally  there can be no assurance that our current or future products will not be subject to third party claims of infringement 
any litigation to determine the validity of any third party claims could result in significant expense and divert the efforts our technical and management personnel  whether or not any litigation is determined in favor of us 
in the event of an adverse result in litigation  we could be required to expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology or to obtain licenses to the technology that is the subject of the litigation 
there can be no assurance that the company would be successful in this development or that any such licenses would be available on commercially reasonable terms 
we also rely on technology licensed from third parties 
there can be no assurance that these licenses will continue to be available upon reasonable terms  if at all 
any impairment or termination of our relationship with third party licensors could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
there can be no assurance that our precautions will be adequate to deter misappropriation or infringement of our proprietary technologies 
we have received  and may receive in the future  communications asserting that our products infringe the proprietary rights of third parties or seeking indemnification against the alleged infringement 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us with respect to current or future products or that any assertion may not require us to enter into royalty arrangements or result in costly litigation 
any claims  with or without merit  can be time consuming and expensive to defend 
there can be no assurance that any intellectual property litigation will not have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our stock price has been volatile  and is likely to continue to be volatile in the future 
the price of our common stock has fluctuated widely in the past 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock  or the perception that sales could occur  could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock 
our management believes past fluctuations may have been caused by the factors identified above  and that these factors may continue to affect the market price of our common stock 
additionally  stock markets have experienced extreme price volatility in recent years 
this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market price of the common stock of us and other high technology companies  often for reasons unrelated to operating performance 
we anticipate that prices for our common stock may continue to be volatile 
future stock price volatility for may result in the initiation of securities litigation against us  which may divert substantial management and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may require additional capital in the future  and may be unable to obtain this capital at all or on commercially reasonable terms 
the development and marketing of products requires significant amounts of capital 
a decline in future orders and revenues might require us to seek additional capital to meet our working capital needs during or beyond the next twelve months if we are unable to reduce expenses to the degree necessary to avoid incurring losses 
if we need additional capital resources  we may be required to sell additional equity or debt securities  secure additional lines of credit or obtain other third party financing 
the timing and amount of such capital requirements cannot be determined at this time and will depend on a number of factors  including demand for our existing and new products and changes in technology in the networking industry 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on satisfactory terms when needed  if at all 
failure to raise such additional financing  if needed  may result in our inability to achieve our long term business objectives 
to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of these securities would result in additional dilution to our shareholders 
recent terrorist activity in the united states and the military action to counter terrorism could adversely impact our business 
terrorist acts or acts of war wherever located around the world could significantly impact our revenue  costs and expenses and financial condition 
the terrorist attacks that took place in the united states on september  have created many economic and political uncertainties  some of which may materially harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
the long term effects on our business of the september  attacks and the ensuing war on terror are unknown 
the potential for future terrorist attacks  the national and international responses to terrorist attacks or perceived threats to national security  and other actual or potential conflicts  acts of war or hostility  including any action against iraq involving the united states  have created many economic and political uncertainties that could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition in ways that cannot presently be predicted 
the costs of compliance with recent developments in corporate governance regulation may affect our business  operating results and financial condition in ways that presently cannot be predicted 
beginning with the enactment of the sarbanes oxley act of  a significant number of new corporate governance requirements have been adopted or proposed through legislation and regulation by the securities and exchange commission and nasdaq national stock market 
we may not be successful in complying with these requirements at all times in the future 
additionally  we expect these developments to increase our legal compliance and accounting costs  and to make some activities more difficult  such as stockholder approval of new stock option plans 
we expect these developments to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage 
these developments could make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors  or qualified executive officers 
we are presently evaluating and monitoring regulatory developments and cannot estimate the timing or magnitude of additional costs we may incur as a result  or the effect that these increased costs may have on our operating results 
voting control by officer  directors and affiliates may delay  defer or prevent a change of control 
at march   our officers and directors and their affiliates beneficially owned approximately of the outstanding shares of common stock 
accordingly  together they had the ability to significantly influence the election of our directors and other corporate actions requiring shareholder approval 
such concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control 
provisions in our charter documents might deter a company from acquiring us  which could inhibit your ability to receive an acquisition premium for your shares 
our board of directors has authority to issue shares of preferred stock and to fix the rights  including voting rights  of these shares without any further vote or action by the shareholders 
the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock  while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes  could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock  thereby delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control 
furthermore  such preferred stock may have other rights  including economic rights  senior to the common stock  and as a result  the issuance thereof could have a material adverse effect on the market 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
examples of costs covered by the standard include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring  discontinued operation  plant closing  or other exit or disposal activity 
sfas no 
replaces eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december  management does not expect this statement to have a material impact on the company s results of operations or consolidated financial statements  although sfas no 
may impact the timing of recognition of costs associated with future restructuring  exit or disposal activities 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  fin 
fin requires that upon issuance of a guarantee  a guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of an obligation assumed under a guarantee 
fin also requires additional disclosures by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about the obligations associated with guarantees issued 
the recognition provisions of fin are effective for any guarantees issued or modified after december  the consolidated financial statements included in this form k comply with the disclosure requirements of this interpretation 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure that amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition to sfas no 
s fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas no

and apb opinion no 
 interim financial reporting  to require disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies of the effects of an entity s accounting policy with respect to stock based employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements

to require companies to account for employee stock options using the fair value method 
sfa no 
is effective for fiscal years ending after december  the consolidated financial statements included in this form k comply with the requirements of sfas no 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we had no holdings of derivative financial or commodity instruments at december  however  we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
while much of our revenue is transacted in u 
s dollars  some revenues and capital spending are transacted in pounds sterling 
these amounts are not currently material to our financial statements  therefore we believe that foreign currency exchange rates should not materially affect our overall financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the fair value of our money market accounts and related income would not be significantly impacted by increases or decreases in interest rates due mainly to the highly liquid nature of these investments 
however  sharp declines in interest rates could seriously harm interest earnings
