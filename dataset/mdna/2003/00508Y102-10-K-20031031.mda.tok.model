the purpose of this discussion and analysis is to enhance the understanding and evaluation of the results of operations  financial position  cash flows  indebtedness  and other key financial information of acuity brands and its subsidiaries for the years ended august    and and to describe certain potential risk factors associated with the company 
for a more complete understanding of this discussion  please read the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report 
also  please refer to the company s registration statement on form a filed with the securities and exchange commission on november  for additional information regarding the company  its formation  and potential risk factors associated with the spin off 

table of contents overview company on november   the board of directors of national service industries  inc approved the spin off of its lighting equipment and specialty products businesses into a separate publicly traded company with its own management and board of directors 
the spin off was effected on november  through a tax free distribution to nsi stockholders of percent of the outstanding shares of common stock of acuity brands  inc  at that time a wholly owned subsidiary of nsi owning and operating the lighting equipment and specialty products businesses 
each nsi stockholder of record as of november   the record date for the distribution  received one share of acuity brands common stock for each share of nsi common stock held at that date 
the company operates on a fiscal year end of august therefore  the results of operations prior to november  are based on certain assumptions more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
acuity brands is a holding company that owns and manages two business units  each operating a collection of businesses  which sell products and provide services to customers in numerous channels  primarily for consumer  commercial  and industrial applications 
the business units of acuity brands operate in two distinct segments based on the different products designed  manufactured  and distributed and the customers served acuity brands lighting abl and acuity specialty products group asp 
the company believes abl is one of the world s leading manufacturers and distributors of lighting fixtures  with a broad  highly configurable product offering consisting of roughly  active products as part of over  product groups that are sold to approximately  customers 
abl operates factories and distribution facilities to serve its extensive customer base 
asp is a leading producer and distributor of cleaning and maintenance products in north america and portions of western europe 
asp manufactures over  different products from six plants and serves over  customers through a network of distribution centers and warehouses 
acuity brands  with its principal office in atlanta  georgia  has approximately  employees worldwide 
while acuity brands is less than two years old  the two segments that make up the company are comprised of organizations with long histories and well known brands 
strategy a long term objective of acuity brands is to be a broader  more diversified manufacturing and distribution organization capable of delivering consistent growth in earnings and cash flow 
a broader and more diversified organization is one that creates less dependency on a single market or customer and generally reduces volatility in earnings and cash flow caused by the cyclicality of a dominant industry 
acuity brands focused on the following four initiatives during fiscal directed at the achievement of the company s long term financial goals of growing earnings per share in excess of percent per annum  generating consolidated operating margins in excess of percent  providing a return on stockholder s equity of percent or better  and reducing the company s debt to total capitalization ratio to below percent provide customers with superior  value added products and services diversify the customer base and channels of distribution implement profit improvement and cost containment programs reduce debt overall  fiscal proved to be a challenging year for acuity brands  enjoying success on many fronts while managing through a number of issues 
these issues included difficult economic conditions that were more prolonged than many economists predicted at the start of the year 
although gross domestic product in the united states  the company s primary area of operation  is expected to increase between two and three percent for calendar year  continued weakness was particularly evident in certain key sectors of the economy  
table of contents including commercial construction  electrical utilities  and industrial manufacturing  many of which have reported declines from the previous year 
for acuity brands  these conditions created a business environment characterized by weak demand in key markets  rising product related costs including steel and petroleum based components  and pricing pressures from certain competitors 
in addition  the company experienced higher costs associated with non discretionary spending for various insurance programs 
the company also resolved the patent litigation with genlyte at abl and addressed certain environmental matters at asp 
however  in spite of these issues  acuity brands grew sales by approximately four percent due primarily to initiatives to diversify the company s customer base and channels of distribution  largely through continued expansion into the home improvement channel at both abl and asp 
further  the company made investments to expand and enlarge its global supply chain  to develop and introduce new products  to accelerate sales and marketing initiatives  and to implement new organizational development programs 
the cost of many of these initiatives and the negative influences impacting the company s key markets was offset by profit improvement programs implemented to better manage working capital and control discretionary spending  to lower product costs  and to enhance manufacturing efficiencies 
these actions allowed the company to generate substantial cash flow and to reduce debt by million during fiscal through a combination of operating income  improved working capital management  and the impact of profit improvement and cost containment programs implemented throughout the company 
during fiscal  management intends to build on the success and momentum of initiatives implemented in prior years as well as new programs to enhance product development  productivity  and profitability 
in  the company will focus on programs to enhance the following areas pricing and selling effectiveness retail channel of distribution global supply chain information technology organizational development the expected outcome of these activities will be to better position the company to deliver on its full potential  to provide a platform for future growth opportunities  and to allow the company to achieve its long term financial goals 
see outlook section below for additional information 
liquidity and capital resources principal sources of liquidity for the company are operating cash flows generated primarily from its business segments and various sources of borrowings 
the capital structure of the company is comprised principally of an asset backed securitization program  borrowings from banks  senior notes  and the equity of its stockholders 
the ability of the company to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and to be able to access certain capital markets  including banks  is necessary for the company to meet its obligations as they become due and maintain compliance with its debt covenants 
the company s ongoing liquidity will depend on a number of factors  including available cash resources  cash flow from operations  and the company s ability to comply with covenants contained in certain of its financing agreements 
based on current earnings projections and prevailing market conditions  both for customer demand and various capital markets  the company believes that over the next twelve months it will have sufficient liquidity and availability under its financing arrangements to fund its operations as currently planned and its anticipated capital investment and profit improvement initiatives  to repay borrowings as currently scheduled  to pay the same quarterly stockholder dividends in as were paid in  and to make required contributions into the 
table of contents company s defined benefit plans 
the company expects to invest between million and million for new plant and equipment during the increase in capital spending in fiscal compared to is due primarily to expenditures related to the consolidation of certain manufacturing facilities and enhancements to information technology capabilities within abl and investments to improve manufacturing and waste management capabilities at asp 
approximately percent of the consolidated capital spending is expected to occur in the first half of as a consequence  the company expects total indebtedness to increase by up to percent in the first half of from million reported at august  overall  the company expects to reduce total debt by the end of fiscal to approximately million 
see further information in the outlook section below 
cash flow the company continues to generate substantial cash flow from operations 
in  the company generated million in cash flow from operations compared to million and million reported in and  respectively 
earnings and improved working capital management in each segment were the primary contributors to the company s cash flow from operations in  partially offset by the payment of approximately million related to the settlement of litigation with genlyte 
the company used its cash flow in primarily to reduce debt  to fund capital expenditures  and to fund quarterly dividend payments 
management believes that achieving the proper returns on its invested capital is a key factor in driving stockholder value 
the company spent million and million in and  respectively  for new tooling  machinery and equipment 
the decrease in spending in is due primarily to a slower pace of investment caused by the timing of the company s supply chain initiative at abl 
over the last three years  the company invested a total of million for new plant  equipment and tooling primarily to improve productivity and product quality  increase manufacturing efficiencies  and enhance its customer service capabilities in each segment 
as noted above  management expects capital spending to increase during primarily due to the consolidation of certain manufacturing facilities and enhancements to information technology capabilities within abl and investments to improve manufacturing and waste management capabilities at asp 
the company believes that these investments will enhance its operations and financial performance in the future 
consolidated working capital at august  was million compared to million at august   an increase of million 
consolidated working capital at august  was million 
the increase in working capital in compared to was primarily due to reduced short term borrowings partially offset by favorable declines in accounts receivable and inventory 
more importantly  operating working capital calculated by adding accounts receivable  net  plus inventory  and subtracting accounts payable declined million percent to million at august  from the end of and million percent from the end of the decline in operating working capital during was due primarily to lower accounts receivable resulting from more favorable terms negotiated with certain customers and lower inventory levels 
the company lowered inventory levels  primarily at abl  because improved manufacturing efficiencies resulted in reduced cycle times and better coordination with vendors  while continuing to meet the needs of customers and increasing net sales 
operating working capital as a percentage of net sales at the end of declined to percent from percent in despite the weak economic environment in  the company did manage to generate a significant amount of operating cash flow  which was used to reduce outstanding debt as more fully described below 
at august   the current ratio of the company improved to compared to at the end of the company s consolidated cash position grew to million at august  compared to million at august   primarily due to the timing of the availability of funds received from customers at year end

the company s operating lease obligations are described in note commitments and contingencies 
capitalization total debt outstanding at august  was million compared to million at august  and million at november  this represents a decrease of million percent and million percent from august  and november   respectively 
the decrease in fiscal was due primarily to the strong cash flow from operations  partially offset by capital expenditures and the payment of dividends 
in april  the company modified certain terms and conditions of its revolving credit facility primarily to extend the day component of the credit facility and to incorporate changes to the maximum leverage ratio  the ratio of total indebtedness to ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation expense  and amortization expense as such terms are defined in the revolving credit facility 
the maximum leverage ratio  currently at  decreases to at november   and then to at may  the leverage ratio is computed at the end of each fiscal quarter 
in addition  maximum available borrowings under the day component of the revolving credit facility  which now matures in april  decreased to million from million 
no changes were made to the maximum available borrowings or the maturity date of the three year component of the credit facility 
at august   the company was in compliance with all financial covenants in the revolving credit facility and had additional borrowing capacity of million under the most restrictive covenant in effect at that time 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding restrictions contained in the revolving credit facility 
during  the company s consolidated stockholders equity increased million to million at august  as net income during was partially offset by dividend payments of million and an after tax adjustment of million related to the company s pension obligations 
the company s debt to total capital ratio was approximately percent at august   down from approximately percent at august  
table of contents dividends the company paid cash dividends on common stock of million per share during compared to million in prior to november   the company was a subsidiary of nsi  as more fully described above  and did not pay dividends separately to stockholders of nsi 
the company does not currently have any plans to change its dividend rate  however  each quarterly dividend must be approved by the board of directors 
results of operations fiscal year compared with fiscal year consolidated results consolidated net sales were billion in compared to billion reported in  an increase of percent 
for the year ended august   the company reported net income of million compared to million earned in earnings per share were in compared to reported in included in net income and earnings per share for were million of pre tax expense per share related to the settlement of patent litigation with genlyte discussed below and approximately million of pre tax expense per share related to environmental matters at asp discussed below 
in addition  the company incurred approximately million in legal costs over the past two years associated with the genlyte patent litigation 
net sales increased approximately percent and percent at abl and asp  respectively  in spite of weak economic conditions in key markets 
the increase in net sales at abl was due primarily to greater shipments of products through channels of distribution serving national accounts and home improvement centers and to price increases for certain products 
this was partially offset by lower shipments to certain other key commercial and industrial markets due primarily to the continued economic weakness that prevailed throughout the year 
net sales at asp increased as greater shipments to mass merchandisers and home improvement centers and higher sales in europe and canada were partially offset by decreased net sales in the core industrial and institutional channel attributable to weak economic conditions 
consolidated operating profit was million percent of net sales in compared to million percent of net sales reported in  a decrease of percent 
as noted above  operating profit included approximately million of pre tax expense related to the settlement of patent litigation with genlyte and approximately million of pre tax expense related to certain environmental matters 
excluding these items  operating profit in would have been approximately million percent of net sales 
the slight increase in operating profit in  excluding the legal settlement and environmental matters  was due primarily to the additional contribution from the increase in sales noted above  offset primarily by pricing pressures from certain competitors  rising product related costs including steel and petroleum based components  and non discretionary spending for various insurance programs 
the company also made investments to expand its global supply chain  to develop and introduce new products  to accelerate sales and marketing initiatives  and to implement a new organizational development program 
overall in  the company was able to offset the cost of many of these new initiatives and the negative influences impacting the company s key markets through profit improvement programs implemented to better manage discretionary spending  to lower product costs including strategic sourcing  and to enhance manufacturing efficiencies 
consolidated gross profit margins increased to percent of net sales in from percent reported in gross profit margins increased largely as a result of the higher net sales noted above and the impact of profit improvement initiatives that helped offset the cost of higher raw materials and expenses associated with the consolidation of certain manufacturing facilities at abl 
operating expenses at acuity brands in were million percent of net sales compared to million percent of net sales in benefits of cost containment programs throughout the company were more than offset by increases in non discretionary spending  the settlement of the genlyte litigation  charges related to environmental matters at asp  higher expenses for sales and marketing initiatives  higher logistics costs  and higher corporate expenses associated primarily with stock based benefit programs 

table of contents other income expense  net  for acuity brands was made up primarily of interest expense and other miscellaneous  non operating activity including the gain or loss on the sale of assets  certain restructuring charges  and gains or losses on foreign currency transactions 
interest expense  net was million and million in and  respectively

the effective tax rate reported by the company was percent and percent in and  respectively 
acuity brands lighting acuity brands lighting reported net sales of approximately billion and billion for the years ending august   and  respectively  an increase of percent 
the increase in net sales during was due primarily to greater shipments of products through channels of distribution serving national accounts and home improvement centers and the impact of price increases for certain products 
this was partially offset by lower shipments to certain other key commercial and industrial markets due to the continued economic weakness that prevailed throughout the year 
the backlog at abl decreased million  or percent  to million at august  from august  operating profit increased percent in to million from million reported in operating profit in included million of pre tax expense related to the settlement of litigation with genlyte discussed below 
excluding this item  operating profit would have increased percent to million 
the increase in operating profit in was primarily the result of the contribution margin from the higher sales noted above and continuous improvement programs  including sourcing initiatives to lower product costs and improvements in the manufacturing operations at many abl locations 
these items were partially offset by costs associated with the consolidation of certain manufacturing facilities  higher raw materials costs  greater spending for sales and marketing initiatives associated with new product introductions and penetration of the home improvement channel  and higher logistics costs 
in august  abl settled a patent infringement suit brought against it by genlyte in march in the united states district court  western district of kentucky 
acuity brands recorded and paid the million pre tax settlement expense in its fiscal quarter ending august  see item legal proceedings for more information regarding the settlement 
abl will discontinue sales of the product as currently designed and will begin manufacturing an alternative design late in calendar so that it will be available by january  the company does not expect any disruption of service to customers 
acuity specialty products net sales at asp were million in compared with million in the increase in net sales was primarily due to greater shipments to mass merchandisers and home improvement centers and higher net sales in europe and canada  partially offset by softness in the core industrial and institutional channel attributable to weak economic conditions 
in the retail channel  sales increased in due primarily to the number of home improvement centers served and greater shipments to mass merchandisers 
operating profit decreased percent in to million from million reported in the decrease in operating profit in was primarily the result of the higher costs for certain initiatives  including new product introductions  increased spending to penetrate the mass merchandise channel  and expanded sales  marketing and logistics programs  rising costs for certain raw materials  partially offset by various initiatives to reduce expenses  a million charge related to environmental matters  and a million charge to reflect the fair market value of certain inventories 
see item legal proceedings for more information regarding the environmental matters at asp 

table of contents corporate corporate expenses increased to million in from million reported in the increase in corporate expense in was primarily due to increased expenses associated with certain stock based benefit programs  liability insurance  and expanded audit services 
fiscal compared with fiscal consolidated results fiscal can best be characterized as managing well to modestly mitigate the effects of a difficult economic environment 
while many economists were predicting a soft landing for the economy  with a rebound expected in the second half of the company s fiscal year  it became evident early on that this was not going to be the case  particularly in the company s largest market  the non residential  commercial construction industry 
the impact on acuity brands of this weak economic environment was lower shipments of products to customers in many of its key sales channels in both segments and severe price competition for remaining orders  primarily in the commercial construction market 
this  along with rising costs in non discretionary areas such as insurance  made expanding profitability very difficult 
as a consequence  management initiated programs to adapt to these changing market conditions by focusing on other levers to drive financial performance  including generating additional revenue from new products and channels of distribution  implementing various profit improvement and cost containment programs to limit spending and improve manufacturing efficiencies  and generating free cash flow through better working capital utilization 
these concerted actions allowed the company to generate substantial cash flow in and modest earnings while continuing to serve its vast customer base 
overall  consolidated net sales were billion in compared to billion reported in for the year ended august   the company reported net income of million compared to million earned in earnings per share were in compared to reported in excluding the results from the divestiture of certain foreign operations of asp in fiscal and the acquisition of american electric lighting american electric in early fiscal  net sales would have been billion in and billion in similarly  excluding the pre tax impact of million in gains on the sale of assets and million for the reversal of certain restructuring expenses  net income in would have been million  or per share 
in  net income would have been million  or per share  excluding the pre tax impact of the million loss from the divested operations at asp  million for restructuring and impairment charges  million for the termination of a purchase obligation  and million in discontinued amortization expense from the adoption of sfas no 
please refer to notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements  which more fully describe the discontinuation of amortization of goodwill and certain intangibles  the acquisition of american electric  and the divestiture of the foreign operations of asp 
excluding the acquisition of american electric and the divesture of the foreign operations noted above  net sales at acuity brands decreased approximately three percent in when compared to the decline occurred at abl and was partially offset by a modest increase at asp 
the decline was primarily due to soft demand and lower selling prices at abl for certain types of fixtures for industrial and office applications  partially offset by an increase in sales through the retail channel at both abl and asp 
consolidated operating profit was down percent in to million percent of net sales from million percent of net sales reported in the decline in operating profit in was primarily a result of the lost contribution margin on the lower sales noted above  including price erosion experienced in certain key lighting fixture markets  and higher spending for non discretionary items  partially offset by various profit improvement and cost containment programs and lower corporate expenses 
consolidated gross profit margins declined to percent of net sales in from percent reported in the decline in gross profit margins occurred primarily at abl due to the impact of significant price competition noted above  partially offset by lower costs and expenses due to various profit improvement initiatives and cost containment programs implemented in gross profit margins remained essentially flat at asp over the two year period 
operating expenses at acuity brands in were million percent of net sales compared to 
table of contents million percent of net sales in excluding amortization expense  operating expenses as a percentage of sales in remained essentially the same as benefits of cost containment programs throughout the company were primarily offset by increases in non discretionary spending 
other income expense  net  for acuity brands is made up primarily of interest expense and other miscellaneous  non operating activity including the gain or loss on the sale of assets  certain restructuring charges  and gains or losses on foreign currency transactions 
interest expense  net was million and million in and  respectively 
interest expense  net was down percent in compared to primarily because of reduced levels of debt outstanding throughout the period and lower interest rates for much of in  the company generated a pre tax gain of million on the sale of certain non core assets 
in  the company incurred other expenses associated with non operating activities totaling a pre tax loss of million  primarily for the loss associated with the disposal of certain foreign assets at asp and restructuring and other charges related to non operating activities of the company 
the effective tax rate reported by the company was percent and percent in and  respectively 
the decline in the tax rate was primarily the result of the legal entity restructuring that occurred in connection with the spin off and the elimination of amortization of goodwill 
acuity brands lighting acuity brands lighting reported net sales of approximately billion for each of the years ending august  and excluding net sales contributed from the acquisition of american electric lighting in october  net sales would have decreased approximately percent during the decline in net sales during was due primarily to lower shipments to certain commercial and industrial markets and reduced selling prices for certain key products due to intense price competition for available orders 
operating profit was down percent in to million percent of net sales from million percent of net sales reported in the decline in operating profit in was primarily the result of the lost contribution on the lower sales noted above due principally to product mix changes and price erosion experienced in certain lighting fixture markets  higher spending for non discretionary items such as medical and property insurance  and greater investments in certain sales and marketing programs 
this decline was partially offset by profit improvement initiatives and cost containment programs that reduced costs and improved productivity in key factories in these programs included efforts to source materials more effectively  streamline production through better integration with suppliers and eliminate costs associated with non value added activities 
also  abl expanded its channels of distribution and the types of customers served in the adoption of a new accounting standard that eliminated amortization of goodwill and certain intangibles contributed approximately million to operating profit at abl 
acuity specialty products net sales at asp were million in  compared with million reported in excluding the results from the divestiture of certain foreign operations during  net sales would have been million in the increase in net sales was primarily due to continued strength in the retail sector and  to a lesser extent  in certain niche markets 
operating profit increased percent in to million percent of net sales from million percent of net sales reported in excluding the results from the divestiture of certain foreign operations during  operating profit would have been million in the increase in operating profit in was primarily the result of the profit contribution on higher volumes  the impact of profit improvement programs  and the elimination of approximately million of amortization expense 
these items were partially offset by greater investments in sales initiatives and higher insurance costs 
asp implemented programs such as sourcing initiatives  cost containment programs and aggressive marketing strategies that allowed the segment to produce solid financial performance while expanding penetration of key market niches and further diversifying the customer base 
unfortunately in  many of those efforts merely offset the impact of rising costs for insurance programs 

table of contents corporate corporate expenses decreased percent in to million from million reported in the decrease in corporate expense in was primarily due to cost containment programs and the reorganization of the corporate staff 
outlook management projects total year earnings for to be between and per share compared to per share reported in the range for is based on the current economic environment and assumes that the company s key markets do not deteriorate further 
included in the projected earnings per share range for for acuity brands are incremental expenses anticipated for stock based plans approximately million pre tax  or per share  primarily related to stock based awards expected to be granted in the second quarter of  and for pension expense approximately million  pre tax  or per share  due primarily to declines in the discount rates used to compute the expense and the august  pension obligations 
in  the company anticipates that various profit improvement programs and changes in product mix will more than offset expected higher costs for wages and employee benefits  insurance programs  and raw materials  all of which could be significant  and the potential impact of pricing pressures driven by over capacity and weak customer demand in key markets in north america 
the company expects earnings in the first half of to approximate those reported in the same period in  given the negative impact of the items noted above and current economic conditions  and expects improvement in the second half of fiscal due primarily to the anticipated seasonal pattern and the benefit of profit improvement programs  some of which are just now getting underway 
management of acuity brands remains confident in the long term potential of the businesses that comprise acuity brands and the expected impact of the initiatives the company continues to implement 
however  management continues to be cautious about near term results due primarily to uncertainty in the economic environment  particularly for non residential construction and certain industrial markets 
while some economists and forecasting organizations continue to predict that the domestic economy will improve in the near term  management does not expect any significant rebound until late in nor does management expect that this late recovery will meaningfully impact as a consequence  the company is preparing for another year of very difficult conditions 
based on management s current view of the economy and demand in the company s key markets  management expects net sales to improve nominally in compared to therefore  the company expects that a substantial portion of any improvement in earnings in compared to will be due primarily to benefits from profit improvement initiatives aimed at creating a stronger  more capable organization 
the focus of the organization will remain on improving the products and services provided to customers  becoming more productive and efficient  and enhancing profitability while continuing to diversify and expand the many end markets and customers served 
as part of that effort in  the company commenced an initiative to improve the capabilities and cost structure of the manufacturing  distribution and procurement base at abl 
this multi faceted initiative  which will take almost three years to complete  will result in the consolidation of certain facilities into abl s most productive and efficient plants as well as expand the worldwide sourcing capabilities of abl 
a significant portion of the capital investment for this initiative will occur in  while the expenses associated with the consolidation for severance and relocation are expected to be largely offset by cost savings and asset sales from the program 
while the timing of expense recognition will depend on the actual dates of certain events and may impact the company s quarterly results differently than management currently anticipates  management expects that the program will have a relatively neutral impact on earnings per share 
the company expects the benefits from this program to have a positive impact on earnings in 
table of contents critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations addresses the financial condition and results of operations as reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to inventory valuation  depreciation  amortization and the recoverability of long lived assets  including intangible assets  medical  product warranty and other reserves  litigation  and environmental matters 
management bases its estimates and judgments on its substantial historical experience and other relevant factors  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a summary of the accounting policies of acuity brands 
the management of acuity brands believes the following represent the company s critical accounting policies inventories acuity brands records inventory at the lower of cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
management reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess or obsolete inventory primarily based on estimated future demand and current market conditions 
a significant change in customer demand or market conditions could render certain inventory obsolete and thus could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results in the period the change occurs 
long lived and intangible assets and goodwill acuity brands reviews goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment on an annual basis or on an interim basis if an event occurs that might reduce the fair value of the long lived asset below its carrying value 
all other long lived and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized based on the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its estimated fair value  which would be determined based on either discounted future cash flows or other appropriate fair value methods 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
acuity brands adopted sfas no 
as of september  sfas no 
requires companies to cease amortizing goodwill that existed at june  and establishes a new method for testing goodwill for impairment 
sfas no 
also requires that an identifiable intangible asset that is determined to have an indefinite useful economic life not be amortized  but be separately tested for impairment using a fair value based approach 
the evaluation of goodwill and intangibles with indefinite useful lives for impairment requires management to use significant judgments and estimates including  but not limited to  projected future net sales  operating results  and cash flow of each of the company s businesses 
although management currently believes that the estimates used in the evaluation of goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives are reasonable  differences between actual and expected net sales  operating results  and cash flow could cause these assets to be deemed impaired 
if this were to occur  the company would be required to charge to earnings the write down in value of such assets  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial position 

table of contents specifically  acuity brands has two unamortized trade names with an aggregate carrying value of million 
management estimates the fair value of these unamortized trade names using a fair value model based on discounted future cash flows 
future cash flows associated with each of the company s unamortized trade names are calculated by applying a theoretical royalty rate a willing third party would pay for use of the particular trade name to estimated future net sales 
the present value of the resulting after tax cash flow is management s current estimate of the fair value of the trade names 
this fair value model requires management to make several significant assumptions  including estimated future net sales  the royalty rate  and the discount rate 
differences between expected and actual results can result in significantly different valuations 
if future operating results are unfavorable compared to forecasted amounts  the company may be required to reduce the theoretical royalty rate used in the fair value model 
a reduction in the theoretical royalty rate would result in lower expected  future after tax cash flow in the valuation model 
accordingly  an impairment charge would be recorded at that time 
to illustrate the potential impact of unfavorable changes in the assumptions underlying the fair value model  a one hundred basis point reduction in the theoretical royalty rate related to the valuation of the holophane trade name acquired in would result in a pre tax impairment charge of approximately percent  or million  of the carrying value of the trade name 
self insurance it is the policy of the company to self insure for certain insurable property and casualty risks consisting primarily of physical loss to property  business interruptions resulting from property losses  workers compensation  comprehensive general liability  and auto liability 
insurance coverage is obtained for catastrophic property and casualty exposures as well as those risks required to be insured by law or contract 
based on an independent actuary s estimate of the aggregate liability for claims incurred  a provision for claims under the self insured program is recorded and revised annually 
the actuarial estimates are subject to uncertainty from various sources  including  among others  changes in claim reporting patterns  claim settlement patterns  judicial decisions  legislation  and economic conditions 
although acuity brands believes that the actuarial estimates are reasonable  significant differences related to the items noted above could materially affect the company s self insurance obligations and future expense 
the company is also self insured for the majority of its medical benefit plans 
the company estimates its aggregate liability for claims incurred by applying a lag factor to the company s historical claims and administrative cost experience 
the appropriateness of the company s lag factor is evaluated and revised  if necessary  annually 
although management believes that the current estimates are reasonable  significant differences related to claim reporting patterns  legislation  and general economic conditions could materially affect the company s medical benefit plan liabilities and future expense 
product warranty acuity brands records an allowance for the estimated amount of future warranty costs when the related revenue is recognized  primarily based on historical experience 
although historical warranty costs have been within expectations  there can be no assurance that future warranty costs will not exceed historical amounts 
if actual future warranty costs exceed historical amounts  additional allowances may be required  which could have a material adverse impact on the company s operating results in future periods 
litigation acuity brands recognizes expense for legal claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and can be reasonably estimated 
due to the difficulty in estimating costs of resolving legal claims  actual costs may be substantially higher than the amounts reserved 

table of contents environmental matters the company recognizes expense for known environmental claims when payments associated with the claims become probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
the actual cost of resolving environmental issues may be higher than that reserved primarily due to difficulty in estimating such costs and potential changes in the status of government regulations 
summary of non gaap financial measures amounts in thousands  except per share data net sales  net income  and operating profit before certain items is reported gaap net sales  net income  and operating profit excluding certain charges or gains recognized during fiscal   and and certain acquired or divested operations

acuity brands was spun off from nsi into a separate publicly traded company with its own management and board of directors through a tax free distribution of percent of the outstanding shares of common stock of acuity brands on november  each nsi stockholder of record as of november   the record date for the distribution  received one share of acuity brands common stock for each share of nsi common stock held at that date 
the following risks associated with acuity brands relate principally to the distribution 
if any of these risks develops into an actual event  the business  financial condition or results of operations of acuity brands could be materially adversely affected 
creditors of nsi may challenge the distribution as a fraudulent conveyance on november   the nsi board of directors made a determination  based on information provided by management and financial experts  that the distribution was permissible under applicable dividend and solvency laws 
there is no certainty  however  that a court would find the decision of the nsi board to be binding on creditors of nsi and acuity brands or that a court would reach the same conclusions as the nsi board in 
table of contents determining whether nsi or acuity brands was insolvent at the time of  or after giving effect to  the distribution 
if a court in a lawsuit by an unpaid creditor or representative of creditors  such as a trustee in bankruptcy  were to find that at the time nsi effected the distribution  nsi or acuity brands was insolvent  was rendered insolvent by reason of the distribution  was engaged in a business or transaction for which their respective remaining assets constituted unreasonably small capital  or intended to incur  or believed it would incur  debts beyond its ability to pay as such debts matured  such court may be asked to void the distribution in whole or in part as a fraudulent conveyance and require that the stockholders return the acuity brands shares in whole or in part to nsi or require acuity brands to fund certain liabilities for the benefit of creditors 
the measure of insolvency for purposes of the foregoing would vary depending upon the jurisdiction whose law is being applied 
generally  however  nsi or acuity brands would be considered insolvent if the fair value of their respective assets was less than the amount of their respective liabilities or if they incurred debt beyond their ability to repay such debt as it matures 
as noted above  the nsi board of directors determined that the distribution was permissible under applicable dividend and solvency laws 
this conclusion was based on numerous factors including  but not limited to  the allocation of assets and liabilities contemplated by the spin off 
the allocation of assets and liabilities associated with the distribution left nsi appropriately capitalized with approximately million in debt 
in addition  certain assets with substantial market value  such as the real property related to nsi s corporate headquarters  remained with nsi 
accordingly  management believes the likelihood that creditors of nsi could successfully challenge the distribution is remote 
during the third quarter of fiscal  a third party acquired nsi through a merger approved by nsi shareholders 
management believes that this transaction is strong confirmation that nsi was solvent at the time of the distribution and remained solvent when it was acquired by the third party 
the acquirer invested equity as well as funds borrowed from secured lenders 
the willingness of the acquirer to invest funds  as well as the willingness of the lenders to loan funds to acquire nsi  represents an independent market assessment of nsi s continuing solvency  which the company believes further diminishes the likelihood that creditors of nsi could successfully challenge the distribution 
failure to qualify as a tax free transaction could result in substantial liability nsi and acuity brands intended for the distribution to be tax free for us federal income tax purposes  and management of acuity brands believes the distribution was tax free for us federal income tax purposes 
the distribution was conditioned upon the receipt by each of nsi and acuity brands of opinions from each of king spalding  counsel to nsi and acuity brands  and ernst young llp  special tax advisor to nsi and acuity brands  that for us federal income tax purposes the receipt of acuity brands shares by nsi stockholders was tax free 
neither nsi nor acuity brands requested an advance ruling from the internal revenue service as to the tax consequences of the distribution 
the opinions of king spalding and ernst young llp are subject to certain assumptions and the accuracy and completeness of certain factual representations and statements made by nsi and acuity brands and certain other data  documentation and other materials that each of king spalding and ernst young llp deemed necessary for purposes of their respective opinions 
if these assumptions and factual representations were incorrect or incomplete in a material respect  the conclusions set forth in the opinions may not be correct 
these opinions represent the views of king spalding and ernst young llp as to the interpretation of existing tax law and accordingly  such opinions are not binding on the internal revenue service or the courts and no assurance can be given that the internal revenue service or the courts will agree with their opinions 
if the distribution does not qualify for tax free treatment  a substantial corporate tax would be payable by the consolidated group of which nsi is the common parent measured by the difference between the aggregate fair market value of the acuity brands shares on the distribution date and nsi s adjusted tax basis in the acuity brands shares on the distribution date 
the corporate level tax would be payable by nsi 
however  acuity brands agreed under certain circumstances to indemnify nsi for all or a portion of this tax liability 
this 
table of contents indemnification obligation  if triggered  could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial position of acuity brands 
in addition  under the applicable treasury regulations  each member of nsi s consolidated group including acuity brands is severally liable for such tax liability 
furthermore  if the distribution does not qualify as tax free  each nsi stockholder who received acuity brands shares in the distribution would be taxed as if he had received a cash dividend equal to the fair market value of his acuity brands shares on the distribution date 
even if the distribution qualifies as tax free  nsi could nevertheless incur a substantial corporate tax liability under section e of the internal revenue code of  as amended  if nsi or acuity brands were to undergo a change in control whether by acquisition  additional share issuance or otherwise pursuant to a plan or series of related transactions which include the distribution 
any transaction  which occurs within the four year period beginning two years prior to the distribution  is presumed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that includes the distribution unless nsi establishes otherwise 
under certain circumstances  acuity brands would be obligated to indemnify nsi for all or a portion of this substantial corporate tax liability under the tax disaffiliation agreement 
this indemnification obligation would have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and financial position of acuity brands 
as required under the tax disaffiliation agreement  king spalding issued an opinion to nsi to the effect that the third party acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of nsi through a merger and the transactions contemplated therein will not cause section e or f of the internal revenue code of  as amended  to apply to nsi s spin off of acuity brands
