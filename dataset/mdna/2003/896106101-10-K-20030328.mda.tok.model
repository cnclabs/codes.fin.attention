item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a leading provider of marine support vessels to the oil and gas industry  primarily in the us gulf of mexico  the north sea  and latin america 
we have a total fleet of vessels  including supply vessels  large capacity platform supply vessels  seven large anchor handling  towing and supply vessels  crew boats and six line handling vessels 
three of the crew boats are under long term leases 
our results of operations are affected primarily by the day rates we receive and our fleet utilization 
demand for our vessels is primarily impacted by the level of offshore oil and gas drilling activity  which is primarily influenced by oil and gas prices and drilling budgets of oil and gas companies 
as a result  oil and gas prices significantly affect our vessel utilization and day rates 
our day rates and utilization rates are also affected by the size  configuration  age and capabilities of our fleet 
in the case of supply boats and psvs  their deck space and liquid mud and dry bulk cement capacity are important attributes 
in certain markets and for certain customers  horsepower and dynamic positioning systems are also important requirements 
for crew boats  size and speed are important factors 
our day rates and utilization can also be affected by the supply of other vessels available in a given market area with similar configurations and capabilities 
our operating costs are primarily a function of fleet size and utilization levels 
the most significant direct operating costs are wages paid to vessel crews  maintenance and repairs and marine insurance 
generally  increases or decreases in vessel utilization only affect that portion of our direct operating costs that is incurred when the vessels are active 
as a result  direct operating costs as a percentage of revenues may vary substantially due to changes in day rates and utilization 
in addition to these variable costs  we incur fixed charges related to the depreciation of our fleet and costs for the routine dry dock inspection  maintenance and repair designed to ensure compliance with us coast guard regulations and to maintain required certifications for our vessels 
maintenance and repair expense and marine inspection amortization charges are generally determined by the aggregate number of dry dockings and other repairs undertaken in a given period 
costs incurred for dry dock inspection and regulatory compliance are capitalized and amortized over the period between such dry dockings  typically two to five years 
results of operations the table below sets forth by vessel class  the average day rates and utilization for our vessels and the average number of vessels we owned during the periods indicated 
we sold all of our six lift boats in the second quarter of year ended december  average vessel day rates supply boats gulf class psvs ahtss north sea crew line handling boats average vessel utilization rates supply boats gulf class psvs ahtss north sea crew line handling boats average number of vessels supply boats gulf class psvs ahtss north sea crew line handling boats average vessel day rate is calculated by dividing a vessel s total revenues in a period by the total number of days such vessel was under contract during such period 
average vessel utilization is calculated by dividing the total number of days for which a vessel is under contract in a period by the total number of days in such period 
set forth below is the internal allocation of our charter revenues and charter revenues less direct operating expenses among vessel classes for each of the periods indicated dollars in thousands 
year ended december  charter revenues supply boats psvs ahtss north sea crew line handling boats other charter revenues less direct vessel operating expenses supply boats psvs ahtss north sea crew line handling boats other comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december our revenues for were million  a decrease of  compared to million for the decrease was due primarily to a decrease in day rates and utilization for our gulf class supply boats and crew boats 
the decrease in utilization and day rates of our gulf class fleet is attributable to decreased gulf drilling activity 
our average gulf class supply boat day rates decreased to  for  compared to  for the average day rates for our fleet of crew boats and line handling vessels decreased to  compared to  for utilization for our gulf class supply boat fleet decreased to in from in due to the decrease in offshore drilling activity in the gulf 
utilization for our crew boats and line handling vessels decreased to in  compared to in  due to the decrease in activity in the gulf 
average day rates for our north sea vessels in decreased to  compared to  for vessel utilization was for  compared to for two large psvs were added to our north sea fleet during during  direct vessel operating expenses increased to million of revenues  compared to million of revenues for the direct vessel operating expenses increased as a result of higher north sea labor costs  higher insurance costs and the addition of two new psvs during the higher north sea labor costs were primarily attributable to the addition of two new psvs during  required union related pay increases and the strengthening of the norwegian kroner against the dollar 
the above rate increases were offset in part by reduced us vessel labor and us maintenance costs 
during the fourth quarter of we recorded a non cash vessel book value write down in the amount of million 
the write down was taken against the book value of two special purpose towing vessels that have limited capabilities as conventional supply vessels 
in response to changes in current and projected market conditions  we will review our long lived assets for impairment as required 
depreciation and amortization expense was million in  down from million for the depreciation and amortization included million of amortization expense associated with goodwill 
pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
no goodwill amortization expense was recorded in amortization of marine inspection costs decreased to million for  from million for due to a reduction in dry docking and marine inspection costs 
our general and administrative expenses increased to million of revenues in  from million of revenues for  principally due to increases in insurance  professional fees and the strengthening of the norwegian kroner against the dollar 
general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of revenues  increased in due primarily to the decrease in average day rates and utilization for our gulf class supply boats and crew boats 
interest expense increased to million during  compared to million during  due to additional borrowings associated with the construction of the two north sea psvs completed in and additional borrowings and interest costs associated with the refinancing of our senior notes 
the tax expense of million is comprised of million in tax expense associated with our north sea operations and in income tax expense associated with our third quarter recordation of a us deferred tax valuation allowance made pursuant to the provisions under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
in  we had an income tax benefit of million and an effective tax rate of 
the variance from our statutory rate is due to income that was contributed by our norwegian operations for which taxes were provided at the norwegian statutory rate of 
we intend to reinvest the unremitted norwegian earnings and postpone their repatriation indefinitely 
we incurred an million extraordinary loss in of this amount million resulted from the early retirement of the company s previously issued senior notes  and approximately  was attributable to the fourth quarter refinancing of our revolving credit facility comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december our revenues for were million  an increase of  compared to million for the increase was due primarily to improved average day rates for our supply boats in the gulf and the increase in day rates and utilization for our north sea fleet resulting from increased north sea drilling activity 
in the third quarter of  we began to experience decreased utilization and day rates for our gulf fleet due to lower oil and gas prices and decreased offshore drilling activity 
our average supply boat day rates in the gulf increased to  for  compared to  for the average day rates for our fleet of crew boats and line handling vessels increased to  compared to  during utilization for our gulf supply boat fleet decreased to in from in due to lower oil and gas prices and the decrease in offshore drilling activity in the gulf in the last half of utilization for the crew boats and line handling vessels decreased to in  compared to in  due to the decrease in activity in the gulf and because two of the line handlers in brazil were off contract for part of the year 
average day rates for our north sea vessels in increased to  compared to  for vessel utilization was for  compared to for as a result of improved market conditions in the north sea in  we reactivated two north sea psvs in mid our last inactive north sea psv was brought back into service in the first quarter of during  direct vessel operating expenses increased to million of revenues  compared to million of revenues for due to increases in labor costs and maintenance expenses and the re activation of a total of nine vessels from mid through direct vessel operating expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased in primarily due to the increase in average vessel day rates for our gulf supply boats and the increase in day rates and utilization for the north sea fleet 
during the third quarter of  we recorded an asset write down in the amount of million  before taxes 
this non cash charge was due to the write down of eight vessels 
six of these vessels had been deactivated or cold stacked for an extended period and have been permanently withdrawn from service 
these vessels were part of larger fleet acquisitions completed in and that had not undergone upgrade and refurbishment as we had done with the rest of our gulf supply boat fleet 
depreciation and amortization expense was million in  down from million for  due to the sale of our lift boats in the second quarter of  and the write down of the book value of eight vessels in the third quarter of amortization of marine inspection costs decreased to million for  from million for our general and administrative expenses increased to million of revenues in  from million of revenues for  principally due to increases in salaries  benefits and professional fees 
general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of revenues  decreased in due to the increase in average day rates for our gulf supply boats and the increase in day rates and utilization for the north sea fleet 
interest expense decreased to million during compared to million during  due to the reduction of our debt in in  we had income tax benefit of million  compared to income tax benefit of million in our effective income tax rate for was 
the variance from our statutory rate is due to income contributed by our norwegian operations  which is deferred at the norwegian statutory rate of  as it is our intent to reinvest the unremitted earnings and postpone their repatriation indefinitely 
liquidity and capital resources our on going capital requirements arise primarily from our need to service debt  acquire  maintain or improve equipment and provide working capital to support our operating activities 
during  million in funds were used in operating activities compared to million in funds provided by operating activities in this decrease in cash generated by operating activities is due principally to decreased revenues generated by our us gulf class fleet due to the low utilization and day rates we experienced in during  we used million in investing activities which consisted primarily of million used to fund construction of five new vessels and other capital additions  partially offset by million from the sale and lease back of two new crew boats and proceeds received from the sale of three line handling vessels and one crew boat 
this compares to the previous year when we used million in investing activities consisting primarily of million used for vessel construction and other capital expenditures and million received from the sale of two crew boats 
during  million was provided by financing activities as a result of our issuance of million of senior notes due and million in borrowings under our bank credit facilities 
these borrowings were used to retire the remaining million principal amount of our senior notes and pay associated accrued interest  to pay million of related call premium and debt issuance costs  to refinance million of bank debt  to pay down million of other debt and to partially fund our vessel construction costs 
see note to our audited consolidated financial statement for further details 
this compares to million in funds used in financing activities in primarily to reduce debt 
as of march   we had outstanding million in senior notes due the senior notes are unsecured and are required to be guaranteed by our primary us operating subsidiaries 
up to of the senior notes may be redeemed at any time prior to may  from the proceeds of an equity offering at the redemption price of of the principal amount plus accrued interest 
commencing on may   the senior notes may be prepaid at a redemption price of plus accrued interest  with the redemption price declining ratably on each may thereafter for each of the succeeding three years 
the indenture governing the senior notes contains covenants that  among other things  prevent us from incurring additional debt  paying dividends or making other distributions  unless our ratio of cash flow to interest expense on a rolling month basis is at least to currently we do not meet this ratio and  therefore  are limited under the indenture to incurring at any one time and having outstanding  up to million of secured debt after the date of issuance of the senior notes million of which was outstanding at march  
we believe this limit will be sufficient to finance our business during the period that we do not satisfy this ratio 
the indenture also contains covenants that restrict our ability to create certain liens  sell assets  or enter into mergers or acquisitions 
as of march   we had outstanding approximately million of united states government guaranteed ship financing bonds  swath series i  at an interest rate of per annum 
these bonds mature in september and require semi annual principal payments of  plus interest 
the bonds are secured by a first preferred ship mortgage on the company s swath vessel and by an assignment of the vessel s charter contract 
as of march   we had outstanding approximately million of united states government guaranteed ship financing bonds at an interest rate of per annum 
these bonds mature in april and require semi annual principal payments of  plus interest 
the bonds are secured by first preferred ship mortgages on two large gulf supply boats 
we maintain two primary bank credit facilities 
in december  we entered into a new million revolving line of credit payable in us dollars 
the new credit facility refinanced and replaced our prior million facility  which was to mature in june  and can be used to provide working capital and for general corporate purposes 
this credit facility matures in december borrowings bear interest at a eurocurrency rate plus a margin that depends on our interest coverage ratio 
as of march   we had million in outstanding borrowings and million in outstanding stand by letters of credit under this credit facility 
of the stand by letters of credit  million was used to secure bonds to temporarily import vessels into caribbean locations  and million secures our obligations under the operating leases discussed below for three foot new built crew boats delivered in october and december  and march the w eighted average interest rate for the bank credit facility was as of december  in march  because of weak market conditions in the first quarter of and concern that such conditions could extend beyond the first quarter  we amended our cash flow to interest expense and tangible net worth covenants in the credit facility 
the amended facility requires us to maintain a minimum cash flow to interest expense ratio  calculated on a rolling four quarter basis  of 
to  increasing to to for the period ending september   to as of december   to as of march   to as of june  and increasing to to by september   a maximum debt to capitalization ratio of  a positive working capital and a minimum tangible net worth of million  as defined 
the facility is secured by a mortgage on substantially all of our us gulf class supply and crew boats  will require us to maintain mortgaged vessel values equal to of bo rrowings under the facility and will limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness  make capital expenditures  pay dividends or make certain other distributions  create certain liens  sell assets or enter into certain mergers or acquisitions 
we also maintain a revolving credit facility payable in norwegian kroner nok in the amount of nok million million 
the commitment amount for this bank facility reduces by nok million million every six months  beginning march  with the nok million million balance of the commitment to expire in september as of february   we had nok million million of debt outstanding under this facility 
we also have a term loan in the amount of nok million million  and a note on one vessel with a february  balance of nok million approximately 
the balance of the term loan matures on june   and the note on the vessel was repaid in march amounts borrowed under these credit facilities bear interest at nibor norwegian interbank offered rate plus a margin 
the weighted average interest rate for these facilities was as of december  borrowings under these facilities are secured by mortgages on of our north sea vessels 
these credit facilities contain covenants that require that our north sea operating unit maintain certain financial ratios and limit its ability to create liens  or merge or consolidate with other entities 
we entered into a master lease agreement in september providing for the sale leaseback of the three foot crew boats we were then constructing 
the master lease required that the lessor pay us of the cost of each crew boat up to a total of million when it was completed 
we are then required to bareboat charter each vessel for years 
we have options to purchase each vessel at the end of the eighth year and also at the end of the year term  for its estimated fair market value 
we sold the three crew boats to the lessor for million an amount equal to the estimated cost of the crew boats and leased them back when they were delivered in october and december  and march the combined monthly lease payments on the three vessels is  as of december   we had paid approximately million of the construction cost of the third crew boat which was completed in march in  we paid  of the cost r emaining on the final crew boat 
our obligations under the master lease are also secured by million in letters of credit issued under our revolving credit facility payable in us dollars 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for operating leases  the amount of the future lease obligations will not be reflected on our balance sheet  but will be included in vessel operating expenses in our income statement when such costs are incurred 
we completed the construction in of our two state of the art ut design  foot psvs equipped with dp dynamic positioning for a cost of approximately nok million million based on exchange rates at the time of their delivery 
the first psv was delivered in june  and began a three year contract 
the second psv was delivered in early october and has been working in the north sea under short term contracts 
the construction cost of the two psvs was funded under our norwegian revolving credit facility 
in july  we signed an eight year contract  with cancellation provisions after six years  with petroleo brasileiro sa petrobras to own and operate a new  technologically advanced anchor handling towing supply vessel ahts 
the ahts will be a ut l design  feet in length and with approximately  horsepower 
pursuant to the petrobras contract  the vessel was required to be built in brazil and must commence operations not later than october we estimate generating approximately million in gross revenues from the petrobras contract  assuming an eight year contract period  of which percent is to be paid in brazilian reais with percent adjusted monthly based on the reais to us dollar exchange rate and percent adjusted annually based on a formula that takes into consideration the exchange rate and inflation indices in brazil 
in october  we entered into an agreement with a brazilian shipyard to construct the ve ssel  as of december   the estimated cost of the contract was approximately million 
as of december   we had made approximately million in progress payments 
thus far in  we have made additional progress payments totaling million 
progress payments under the construction contract for the balance of and are expected to approximate million and million  respectively 
we will require external financing to fund a significant portion of the ahts construction cost 
we are pursuing various alternatives for the financing of the ahts vessel  including long term financing from the brazilian national development bank for up to of project costs  and equity financing for the project in the form of a joint venture with an equity partner 
we have engaged a local consulting firm in brazil to assist us in the loan application process with the national development bank 
we have also engaged a european investment banking firm to assist us in evaluating  sourc ing and structuring a potential joint venture for the ahts project 
our ahts project has received the initial approval of the fundo da marinha mercante fmm of the brazilian ministry of transportation and is currently being evaluated by the national development bank 
while we expect that we will receive final approval and funding for this project during  we can give no assurance regarding the timing or the final terms of such financing 
the following table summarizes our contractual commitments  as of december   related to the principal amount of our debt  leases and other arrangements for the periods indicated below in thousands 
description thereafter long term debt operating leases vessel construction total excludes operating lease commitments of approximately  per month associated with the third crew boat  delivered in march  subject to the master lease agreement 
we do not have any other planned capital expenditures other than between approximately to million to fund the dry docking of vessels and related repairs 
as of march   we had approximately million of financing available under our two revolving credit facilities 
our cash provided from operations for will be determined by the level of day rates and utilization for our vessels  which in turn are affected by expenditures for oil and gas exploration  development and production and industry perceptions of future oil and gas prices in the market areas in which we operate 
also  the level of expenditures on our vessels for dry docking may vary based on the level of day rates and utilization for our vessels and the general outlook for our business 
we believe that cash on hand together with cash provided by operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our debt service requirements  wo rking capital and capital expenditures for at least the next year barring any unforeseen circumstances 
if current activity levels continue in the gulf of mexico or if we are unsuccessful in obtaining financing for the brazilian ahts  it would require us to depend more heavily on our existing revolving credit facilities and make it difficult to meet the required financial covenants in our revolving credit facility payable in dollars 
if we are unable to comply with our financial covenants and cannot amend them  we would be in default under our existing revolving credit agreements and  if our bank lenders took actions to accelerate our indebtedness to them  the indenture for our senior notes 
we cannot make any assurances  however  that the factors beyond our control affecting demand for our vessels will not impact our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations  or obtain borrowings under our credit facilities  in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness and fund our other liquidity needs 
we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness  including our credit facilities  on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  fixed assets  deferred expenses  inventories  goodwill  income taxes  pension liabilities  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual re sults may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider certain accounting policies to be critical policies due to the significant judgement  estimation processes and uncertainty involved for each in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following represent our critical accounting policies 
impairment of long lived assets other than goodwill 
in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable 
we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when the net discounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of those items 
our cash flow estimates are based upon  among other things  historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market rates  utilization  operating performance and other factors 
our estimates of cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  changes in economic conditions or changes in an asset s operating performance 
if the discounted value of the cash flows is less than the carrying value  we recognize an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the net discounted cash flow 
during the year ended december  we recognized million of fixed asset impairments 
impairment of goodwill 
the majority of our goodwill  approximately million at december   relates to the acquisition of our north sea operations that are conducted under our norwegian subsidiary trico supply asa 
the company has determined that our north sea managed operations constitute a reporting unit pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company tests for the possible impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
in assessing reporting unit fair value  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors used to determine fair value 
if these estimates or their related assumptions adversely change in the future  we may be required to record material impairment charges for these assets 
our initial sfas no 
impairment test was performed in the second quarter of reported unit fair value was calculated based on estimated cash flows  comparable industry financial ratios and other analysis 
reporting unit fair value was compared to carrying value and no impairment charge was required as of january  deferred tax valuation allowance 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions  to enable their value to be fully realized 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record valuation allowances against deferred tax assets resulting in a substantial increase in our effective tax rate and a material adverse impact on our consolidated statement of operations 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we recorded a us deferred tax valuation allowance in the third quarter of and an associated us income tax expense of million 
no tax benefit was recorded on the financial statement third and fourth quarter us net operating losses 
deferred marine inspection costs 
we record the cost of major scheduled drydocking inspection costs for our vessels as deferred charges 
we amortize these deferred charges over the expected periods of benefit  typically ranging from two to five years 
the american institute of certified public accountants has issued an exposure draft for a proposed statement of position  accounting for certain costs and activities related to property  plant and equipment  which would require major scheduled inspection costs to be expensed as costs are incurred 
if this proposed statement of position is adopted in its current form  we will be required to write off the balance of our deferred marine inspection costs  which totaled million at december   and expense future costs as incurred 
new accounting standards effective january  the company adopted sfas no 
 business combinations

 business combinations  and prohibits the use of the pooling of interest pooling method of accounting for business combinations initiated after the issuance date of sfas no 
the adoption of sfas no

effective january  the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
supercedes apb opinion no 
 intangible assets  by stating that goodwill will no longer be amortized  but will be tested for impairment in a manner different from how other assets are tested for impairment 
sfas no 
establishes a new method of testing goodwill for impairment by requiring that goodwill be separately tested for impairment using a fair value approach rather than an undiscounted cash flow approach 
goodwill is now tested for impairment at a level referred to as a reporting unit  generally a level lower than that of the total entity 
sfas no 
requires entities to perform the first goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value with the book value of a reporting unit on all reporting units within six months of adopting the statement 
the company determined fair value of its reporting segments  and performed initial impairment testing as prescribed in sfas no 
 based on commonly used financial ratios and analysis 
the company completed its initial sfas no 
impairment test in the second quarter and the analysis determined that there was no goodwill impairment 
the company s fair value analysis is based on estimated reporting unit cash flows  comparable industry financial ratios and other assumptions 
while the company believes its analysis is reasonable  changes in industry conditions  geographic vessel demand  and other variables possibly affecting reporting unit cash flows  comparable financial ratios  and anticipated future performance could materially impact future sfas no 
impairment analysis 
goodwill of a reporting unit shall be tested for impairment after the initial adoption of the statement on an annual basis and b etween annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
since sfas no 
was adopted at january   the company no longer amortizes goodwill 
amortization of goodwill for the twelve months of was  had the company not amortized goodwill for the twelve months ended december   net loss would have been million 
had we not amortized goodwill for the twelve month period ended december   basic and diluted earnings per share would have been 
the company s goodwill balance as of december  represented approximately of total company assets and primarily relates to the december acquisition of its norwegian subsidiary

 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
examples of costs covered by this guidance include termination benefits provided to current employees that are involuntarily terminated under the terms of a benefit arrangement that  in substance  is not an ongoing benefit arrangement or an individual deferred compensation contract  costs to terminate a contract that is not a capital lease  and costs to consolidate facilities or relocate employees 
the provisions of sfas no

the disclosure provisions of fin are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods that end after december  however  the provisions for initial recognition and measurement are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees that are issued or modified after december   irrespective of a guarantor s year end 
the adoption of fin for the year ended december  did not have an impact on the company s financial p osition or results of operations

fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
it applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  fin applies to public enterprises as of the beginning of the applicable interim o r annual period 
the company believes that the adoption of the provisions of fin will have no impact upon its financial position or results of operations 
in june  the accounting standards executive committee of the aicpa  acsec  issued an exposure draft of a proposed statement of position sop  accounting for certain costs and activities related to property  plant  and equipment 
this sop provides guidance on accounting for certain costs and activities relating to property  plant  and equipment pp e 
for purposes of this sop  a project stage or timeline framework is used and pp e assets are accounted for at a component level 
costs incurred for pp e are classified into four stages preliminary  preacquisition  acquisition or construction and in service 
the sop requires  among other things  that preliminary  preacquisition and acquisition or construction stage costs  except for payments to obtain an option to acquire pp e  should be charged to expense as incurred 
costs related to pp e that are incurred during the in service stage  including costs of normal  recurrin g  or periodic repairs and maintenance activities  should be charged to expense as incurred unless the costs are incurred for acquisition of additional pp e or components of pp e or the replacement of existing pp e or components of pp e 
costs of planned major maintenance activities are not a separate pp e asset or component 
those costs should be charged to expense  except for acquisitions or replacements of components that are capitalizable under the in service stage guidance of this sop 
the acsec is currently reviewing comment letters on the subject sop and is expected to present the sop to the financial accounting standards board by mid year the proposed sop is subject to change 
however  if the proposed sop is adopted in its current form  the company will have to write off its net capitalized deferred marine inspection costs  which totaled million at december  this write off would be accounted for as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of the beginning of the year of adoption 
further evaluation is required by the company to fully quantify the impact of this proposed pronouncement  if adopted 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risk exposures primarily include interest rate and exchange rate fluctuations on derivative and financial instruments as detailed below 
our market risk sensitive instruments are classified as other than trading 
the following sections address the significant market risks associated with our financial activities during trico s exposure to market risk as discussed below includes forward looking statements and represents estimates of possible changes in fair values  future earnings or cash flows that would occur assuming hypothetical future movements in foreign currency exchange rates or interest rates 
our views on market risk are not necessarily indicative of actual results that may occur and do not represent the maximum possible gains and losses that may occur  since actual gains and losses will differ from those estimated  based upon actual fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and the timing of transactions 
interest rate sensitivity we have entered into a number of variable and fixed rate debt obligations  denominated in both the us dollar and the norwegian kroner norwegian debt payable in norwegian kroner  as detailed in note to our consolidated financial statements in item these instruments are subject to interest rate risk 
we manage this risk by monitoring our ratio of fixed and variable rate debt obligations in view of changing market conditions and from time to time altering that ratio by  for example  refinancing balances outstanding under our variable rate bank credit facilities with fixed rate debt or by entering into interest rate swap agreements  when deemed appropriate 
as of december  and we had no outstanding interest rate swap contracts 
as of december  and  we had million and million  respectively  in variable rate debt 
as of december  and  the carrying value of our long term variable rate debt  including accrued interest  was approximately million and million  respectively  which included our us and norwegian bank credit facilities 
the fair value of this debt approximates the carrying value because the interest rates are based on floating rates identified by reference to market rates 
a hypothetical increase in the applicable interest rates as of december  and would increase annual interest expense by approximately million and  respectively 
as of december   the carrying value of our long term fixed rate debt  including accrued interest  was million  which included our senior notes million  marad bonds million  and marad bonds million 
as of december   the carrying value of our long term fixed rate debt  including accrued interest  was million 
the fair value of our long term fixed rate debt as of december  and was approximately million and million  respectively 
fair value was determined using discounted future cash flows based on quoted market prices  where available  on our current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements as of the balance sheet dates 
a hypothetical increase in the applicable interest rates would decrease the fair value of our long term fixed rate debt as of december  and by approximately million and million  respectivel y 
the hypothetical fair values are based on the same assumptions utilized in computing fair values 
foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity the company has substantial operations located outside the united states principally the north sea and brazil for which the functional currency is not the us dollar 
as a result  the reported amount of the company s assets and liabilities related to its non us operations and  therefore  the company s consolidated net assets  will fluctuate based upon changes in currency exchange rates 
we manage foreign currency risk by attempting to contract as much foreign revenue as possible in us dollars 
to the extent that our revenues in foreign countries are denominated in us dollars  changes in foreign currency exchange rates impact our earnings to the extent that costs associated with those us dollar revenues are denominated in the local currency 
the effects of foreign currency fluctuations that we are exposed to as a result of those operations whose functional currencies are not in us dollars are partly mitigated because local expenses of our foreign operations are also generally denominated in the same currency 
in order to further mitigate this risk  we may utilize foreign currency forward contracts to better match the currency of our revenues and associated costs 
we do not use foreign currency forward contracts for trading or speculative purposes 
the counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions  which minimizes counterparty credit risk 
in accordance with sfas no 
 foreign currency translation  all assets and liabilities of the company s foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period  and revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
the resulting translation adjustments are reflected in a separate component of stockholders equity 
approximately of our net assets are impacted by changes in foreign currencies in relation to the us dollar 
we recorded a million adjustment to our stockholders equity account for the year ended december  as a result of the net increase in the value of the norwegian kroner and other currencies against the us dollar 
in we recorded a million adjustment to our stockholders equity account as a result of the net decrease in the value of foreign currencies against the us dollar 
as described above  at december   the company had the equivalent of million of outstanding norwegian kroner denominated indebtedness the equivalent of million of norwegian kroner denominated indebtedness 
the potential increase in the us dollar equivalent of the principal amount outstanding resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in exchange rates at such date would be approximately million at december  million
