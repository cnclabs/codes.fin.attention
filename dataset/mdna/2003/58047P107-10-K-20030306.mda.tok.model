table of contents in addition to various risk management and monitoring tools  we also use an investment rating system to characterize and monitor our expected level of returns on each investment in our portfolio 
we use the following to investment rating scale 
below is a description of the conditions associated with each investment rating investment rating summary description capital gain expected full return of principal and interest or dividend expected with customer performing in accordance with plan full return of principal and interest or dividend expected but customer requires closer monitoring some loss of interest or dividend expected but still expecting an overall positive internal rate of return on the investment loss of interest or dividend and some loss of principal investment expected which would result in an overall negative internal rate of return on the investment the following table shows the distribution of our investments on the to investment rating scale at fair value as of december  and dollars in millions investment rating investments at fair value percentage of total portfolio investments at fair value percentage of total portfolio total we monitor loan concentrations in our portfolio  both on an individual loan basis and on a sector or industry basis  to manage overall portfolio performance due to specific customer issues or specific industry issues

of the investments with a rating  million are loans  of which million are on non accrual 
we monitor individual customer s financial trends in order to assess the appropriate course of action with respect to each customer and to evaluate overall portfolio quality 
we closely monitor the status and performance of each individual investment on a quarterly and  in some cases  a monthly or more frequent basis 
because we are a provider of long term privately negotiated investment capital to growth oriented companies and we actively manage our investments through our contract structure  we do not believe that contract exceptions such as breaches of contractual covenants or late delivery of financial statements are necessarily an indication of deterioration in the credit quality or the need to pursue remedies or an active workout of a portfolio investment 
when a loan becomes days or more past due  or if we otherwise do not expect the customer to be able to service its debt and other obligations  we will  as a general matter  place the loan on non accrual status and cease recognizing interest income on that loan until all principal has been paid 
however  we may make exceptions to this policy if the investment is well secured and in the process of collection 
at december   there were million of loans  or approximately of the investment portfolio  greater than days past due all of which were on non accrual status 
at december   there 
table of contents were million of loans  or approximately of the investment portfolio  on non accrual status

at december   there were no loans greater than days past due or on non accrual status 
when principal and interest on a loan is not paid within the applicable grace period  we will contact the customer for collection 
at that time  we will make a determination as to the extent of the problem  if any 
we will then pursue a commitment for immediate payment and will begin to more actively monitor the investment 
we will formulate strategies to optimize the resolution process and will begin the process of restructuring the investment to better reflect the current financial performance of the customer 
such a restructuring may involve deferring payments of principal and interest  adjusting interest rates or warrant positions  imposing additional fees  amending financial or operating covenants or converting debt to equity 
in general  in order to compensate us for any enhanced risk  we receive appropriate compensation from the customer in connection with a restructuring 
during the process of monitoring a loan that is out of compliance  we will in appropriate circumstances send a notice of non compliance outlining the specific defaults that have occurred and preserving our remedies  and initiate a review of the collateral 
when a restructuring is not the most appropriate course of action  we may determine to pursue remedies available under our loan documents or at law to minimize any potential losses  including initiating foreclosure and or liquidation proceedings

dividends the following table summarizes our dividends declared to date date declared record date payment date amount december  december  january  september  october  october  june  june  july  march  april  april  december  january  january  total declared the aggregate dividend of per share in december consisted of a dividend of per share for the fourth quarter of and an additional dividend of per share representing the distribution of substantially all of our earnings and profits since inception through december  the aggregate dividend of declared in september consisted of a dividend of per share for the third quarter of and an additional dividend of per share which represented the remaining distribution of our earnings and profits since inception through december  the aggregate dividend declared in december along with the dividend declared in september  were required for us to qualify as a regulated investment company 
dividends are paid on all shares including restricted stock 
related party transactions prior to election to be regulated as a business development company  we terminated our stock option plan and adopted a restricted stock program under which we issued  shares of restricted common stock to employees and directors 
the total number of shares issued for the termination of the option plan was based upon the black scholes option pricing model and assumptions and approved by our board of directors 
see note j to consolidated financial statements 
immediately prior to our initial public offering  we issued  shares of common stock for the termination of all warrants held by wachovia corporation related to the management buyout in without regard to exercise price 
at that time  wachovia corporation was also a shareholder 
the total number of shares issued for the termination of the warrants was based on the black scholes option pricing model and assumptions negotiated with wachovia corporation and approved by our board of directors 
in addition  we have a million variable series securitization facility and a million term funding securitization agreement that were arranged by wachovia securities  an affiliate of wachovia corporation 
interest paid to an affiliate of wachovia corporation holding the series notes under the variable series securitization facility totaled million for the year ended december  
table of contents we made cash payments totaling million to non executive employees for the taxes imposed on them associated with the issuance of restricted common stock 
the cash payments assumed a combined federal and state tax rate of for each employee 
additionally  in connection with the termination of our stock option plan  certain executive officers and employees purchased a portion of the  shares of restricted common stock at a per share price of 
those executive officers and employees issued partially non recourse notes to us  with an aggregate face value of million secured by approximately million shares with a value of million at the initial public offering price 
the notes are payable at the end of a four and a half year term  subject to acceleration  bear interest at payable annually and are secured by all of the restricted common stock held by such employee and for some employees  for a specified time period  additional shares of our common stock the employee owns 
the notes are non recourse as to the principal amount but recourse as to the interest 
amounts due on these loans are reflected as a reduction of stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheets 
heller financial  inc provided our primary lending facility prior to december  at that time  heller was a shareholder 
interest paid to heller financial  inc  as agent  totaled million for the year ended december  the heller lending facility was paid off on december  critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies  which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
we believe that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of our accounting policies that currently affect our financial condition and results of operations 
income recognition interest on commercial loans is computed by methods that generally result in level rates of return on principal amounts outstanding 
when a loan becomes days or more past due  or if we otherwise do not expect the customer to be able to service its debt and other obligations  we will  as a general matter  place the loan on non accrual status and cease recognizing interest income on that loan until all principal has been paid 
however  we may make exceptions to this policy if the investment is well secured and in the process of collection 
in accordance with gaap  we include in income certain amounts that we have not yet received in cash  such as contractual payment in kind pik interest  which represents contractually deferred interest added to the loan balance that is generally due at the end of the loan term 
however  in certain cases  a customer makes principal payments on its loan prior to making payments to reduce the pik loan balances and  therefore  the pik portion of a customer s loan can increase while the total outstanding amount of the loan to that customer may stay the same or decrease 
pik loans represented million or of our portfolio of investments as of december  and million or of our portfolio of investments as of december  pik related activity for the year ended december  follows in millions pik loan balance december  pik interest earned during the year ended december  change in interest receivable on pik loans principal payments of cash on pik loans pik loan balance december  additional principal collections during the year ended december  from customers with pik related loans up to the amount of such pik loan balance 
table of contents as of december   of the million of pik loans outstanding have an investment rating of or better and as of december   of the million of pik loans outstanding had an investment rating of or better 
the net increase in loan balances as a result of contracted pik arrangements are separately identified on our consolidated statements of cash flows 
loan origination fees are deferred and amortized as adjustments to the related loan s yield over the contractual life of the loan 
in certain loan arrangements  warrants or other equity interests are received from the borrower as additional origination fees 
the borrowers granting these interests are typically non publicly traded companies 
we record the financial instruments received at estimated fair value as determined by our board of directors 
fair values are determined using various valuation models which attempt to estimate the underlying value of the associated entity 
these models are then applied to our ownership share considering any discounts for transfer restrictions or other terms which impact the value 
changes in these values are recorded through our statement of operations 
any resulting discount on the loan from recordation of warrant and other equity instruments are accreted into income over the term of the loan 
we had million and million of unearned fees as of december  and  respectively 
we recognized million of these fees in income during and million of these fees in income during valuation of investments at december   approximately of our total assets represented investments recorded at fair value 
value  as defined in section a of act  is i the market price for those securities for which a market quotation is readily available and ii for all other securities and assets  fair value is as determined in good faith by the board of directors 
since there is typically no readily ascertainable market value for the investments in our portfolio  we value substantially all of our investments at fair value as determined in good faith by the board of directors pursuant to a valuation policy and a consistent valuation process 
because of the inherent uncertainty of determining the fair value of investments that do not have a readily ascertainable market value  the fair value of our investments determined in good faith by the board of directors may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market existed for the investments  and the differences could be material 
there is no single standard for determining fair value in good faith 
as a result  determining fair value requires that judgment be applied to the specific facts and circumstances of each portfolio investment 
unlike banks  we are not permitted to provide a general reserve for anticipated loan losses 
instead  we must determine the fair value of each individual investment on a quarterly basis 
we will record unrealized depreciation on investments when we believe that an investment has become impaired  including where collection of a loan or realization of an equity security is doubtful 
conversely  we will record unrealized appreciation if we believe that the underlying portfolio company has appreciated in value and  therefore  our investment has also appreciated in value  where appropriate 
as a business development company  we invest primarily in illiquid securities including debt and equity securities of private companies 
the structure of each debt and equity security is specifically negotiated to enable us to protect our investment and maximize our returns 
we generally include many terms governing interest rate  repayment terms  prepayment penalties  financial covenants  operating covenants  ownership parameters  dilution parameters  liquidation preferences  voting rights  and put or call rights 
our investments are generally subject to some restrictions on resale and generally have no established trading market 
because of the type of investments that we make and the nature of our business  our valuation process requires an analysis of various factors 
our fair value methodology includes the examination of  among other things  the underlying investment performance  financial condition and market changing events that impact valuation 
valuation of loans and debt securities as a general rule  we do not value our loans or debt securities above cost  but loans and debt securities will be subject to fair value write downs when the asset is considered impaired 
in many cases  our loan agreements allow for increases in the spread to the base index rate if the financial or operational performance of the customer 
table of contents deteriorates or shows negative variances from the customer s business plan and  in some cases  allow for decreases in the spread if financial or operational performance improves or exceeds the customer s plan 
valuation of equity securities with respect to private equity securities  each investment is valued using industry valuation benchmarks  and then the value is assigned a discount reflecting the illiquid nature of the investment  as well as our minority  non control position 
when an external event such as a purchase transaction  public offering  or subsequent equity sale occurs  the pricing indicated by the external event will be used to corroborate our private equity valuation 
securities that are traded in the over the counter market or on a stock exchange generally will be valued at the prevailing bid price on the valuation date 
however  restricted and unrestricted publicly traded securities may be valued at discounts from the public market value due to restrictions on sale  the size of our investment or market liquidity concerns 
securitization transactions periodically  we transfer pools of loans to special purpose entities spes for use in securitization transactions 
these on balance sheet securitization transactions comprise a significant source of our overall funding  with the total face amount of the outstanding loans assumed by third parties equaling million at december  and million at december  on april   the company adopted the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  which applies prospectively to all securitization transactions occurring after march  adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our operations or financial position 
transfers of loans have not met the requirements of sfas no 
for sales treatment and are  therefore  treated as secured borrowings  with the transferred loans remaining in investments and the related liability recorded in borrowings 
recent developments in january  we completed a transaction to sell the debt securities of one of our portfolio companies  vs a pbi holding llc  at a price below par 
the sale was the result of an agreement between the senior lending syndicate and the equity sponsor 
our debt securities had a fair value of million and unrealized depreciation of million as of december  in conjunction with this transaction  we expect to realize this loss in the first quarter of and expect this realized loss to be offset by the reversal of related unrealized depreciation 
accordingly  we expect no material impact to our overall earnings in the first quarter of as a result of this transaction 
in february  we completed a transaction to acquire the assets of one of our portfolio companies  nbg radio networks  inc  in satisfaction of debt 
the assets will be held and operated through a separate portfolio company controlled by us 
our investment had a fair value of million and unrealized depreciation of million as of december  in conjunction with this transaction  we expect to realize this loss in the first quarter of and expect this realized loss to offset the reversal of the unrealized depreciation 
accordingly  we expect no material impact to our overall earnings in the first quarter of as a result of this transaction 
also in february  we converted million of the senior debt of one of our portfolio companies  ami telecommunications  inc  to equity 
as of december   our investment in this senior debt had unrealized depreciation of million 
in conjunction with this transaction  we expect to realize this loss in the first quarter of and expect this realized loss to offset the reversal of the unrealized depreciation 
accordingly  we expect no material impact to our overall earnings in the first quarter of as a result of this transaction 
in february  we amended certain agreements governing the revolving credit facility 
the amendment and other information related to this facility are further discussed in the borrowings section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and note c to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in march  one of our portfolio companies  intellisec holdings  inc  emerged from bankruptcy and our loans to intellisec were converted to common and preferred stock 
as of december   our senior debt and debtor in possession financing had a combined value of million and unrealized depreciation of million 
in conjunction with this event  we expect to realize this loss in the first quarter of and expect this realized loss to offset the reversal of the unrealized depreciation 
accordingly  we expect no material impact to our overall earnings in the first quarter of as a result of this transaction 
in march  one of our portfolio companies  now communications  inc  filed for voluntary reorganization under chapter of the federal bankruptcy code 
this action appears to have been taken because of a dispute with an unsecured service provider 
we believe that we are adequately secured and we expect no material impact to our overall earnings resulting from this action 

table of contents risk factors investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
you should consider carefully the risks described below and all other information contained in this annual report  including our financial statements and the related notes and the schedules and exhibits to this annual report 
risks related to our business and financial results we have a limited operating history as a business development company and as a regulated investment company  which may impair your ability to assess our prospects 
prior to our initial public offering in december  we had not operated as a business development company under the investment company act of or as a regulated investment company under subchapter m of the internal revenue code 
as a result  we have limited operating results under these regulatory frameworks that can demonstrate to you either their effect on our business or our ability to manage our business under these frameworks 
in addition  prior to our initial public offering  our management had no prior experience managing a business development company or regulated investment company 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to operate successfully as a business development company and a regulated investment company 
because there is generally no established market for which to value our investments  our board of directors determination of their values may differ materially from the values that a ready market or third party would attribute to these investments 
under the act  we are required to carry our portfolio investments at market value or  if there is no readily ascertainable market value  at fair value as determined by our board 
we are not permitted to maintain a general reserve for anticipated loan losses 
instead  we are required by the act to specifically value each individual investment and to record any unrealized depreciation for any asset that we believe has decreased in value 
because there is typically no public market for the loans and equity securities of the companies in which we invest  our board will determine the fair value of these loans and equity securities pursuant to our valuation policy 
these determinations of fair value necessarily will be somewhat subjective 
accordingly  these values may differ materially from the values that would be determined by a third party or placed on the portfolio if there existed a market for our loans and equity securities 
we make loans to and invest in privately owned small and medium sized companies  which may default on their loans  thereby reducing or eliminating the return on our investments 
our portfolio primarily consists of loans to and securities issued by small and medium sized privately owned businesses 
compared to larger publicly owned firms  these companies may be more vulnerable to economic downturns  may have more limited access to capital and higher funding costs  may have a weaker financial position  and may need more capital to expand or compete 
these businesses also may experience substantial variations in operating results 
they may face intense competition  including from companies with greater financial  technical and marketing resources 
typically  they also depend for their success on the management talents and efforts of an individual or a small group of persons 
the death  disability or resignation of any of their key employees could harm their financial condition 
furthermore  some of these companies do business in regulated industries and could be affected by changes in government regulation 
accordingly  these factors could impair their cash flow or result in other events  such as bankruptcy  which could limit their ability to repay their obligations to us  and may adversely affect the return on  or the recovery of  our investment in these businesses 
deterioration in a borrower s financial condition and prospects may be accompanied by deterioration in any collateral for the loan 
some of these companies may be unable to obtain financing from public capital markets or from traditional credit sources  such as commercial banks 
accordingly  advances made to these types of customers may entail a 
table of contents higher risk of loss than advances made to customers who are able to utilize traditional credit sources 
these conditions may also make it difficult for us to obtain repayment of our loans 
furthermore  there is generally no publicly available information about such companies and we must rely on the diligence of our employees to obtain information in connection with our investment decisions 
if we are unable to uncover all material information about these companies  we may not make a fully informed investment decision and we may lose money on our investments 
if the industry sectors in which our portfolio is concentrated experience adverse economic or business conditions  our operating results may be negatively impacted 
our customers are primarily in the communications  information services  media and technology industry sectors 
these customers can experience adverse business conditions or risks related to their industries 
see business market opportunity for a discussion of the types of businesses in each sector that we target 
many media companies rely on advertising  which tends to be cyclical and influenced by macro economic factors  as their primary revenue stream 
in addition  many media companies are subject to risks associated with the increasing cost of raw material commodities such as paper  printing and postage  and broadcasters are subject to the risks associated with a regulated environment 
over the last twelve to eighteen months  we have been negatively affected by our customers in the magazine publishing sector  in particular those with substantial exposure to financial services  telecommunications and technology advertising 
these advertising categories have experienced steeper declines in this economic recession than the general advertising market 
communications companies often have high customer acquisition costs and require significant liquidity 
as a result  these companies require significant infusions of capital and would be adversely affected by a disruption in their ability to raise capital 
in addition  such companies are subject to the risks associated with a changing regulatory environment 
much of the current difficulty facing the industry is a function of overcapacity and speculation by investors related to ongoing deregulation and future demand related to the internet and emerging broadband applications 
information services businesses are subject to risks associated with their dependence on intellectual property assets 
if their ability to access critical intellectual property rights is impaired  their businesses could be suddenly and adversely affected 
other risks for information services businesses include the possibility of innovations that render certain services obsolete 
providers of technology may experience significant costs in keeping their products and services technologically up to date 
some also have high fixed costs and capital expenditure requirements that require significant access to capital 
accordingly  if our customers suffer as some customers currently are due to these adverse business conditions or risks or due to economic slowdowns or downturns in these industry sectors  we will be more vulnerable to losses in our portfolio and our operating results may be negatively impacted 
furthermore  if demand for financing by existing and new customers in these industries declines  we may not be able to increase our lending and investment volume and our operating results will be adversely affected 
the current economic recession or any future economic recessions or downturns could impair our customers ability to repay our loans  harm our operating results and reduce our volume of new loans 
many of our customers may be susceptible to the current economic recession or any future economic recessions or downturns and may be unable to repay our loans during these periods 
therefore  our non performing assets are likely to increase and the value of our portfolio is likely to decrease during these periods 
adverse economic conditions also may decrease the value of collateral securing some of our loans and the value of our equity investments 
the current economic recession has led  and any future economic recessions could 
table of contents lead  to financial losses in our portfolio and a decrease in net income 
unfavorable economic conditions could also lead to a decrease in revenues and assets 
our customers are primarily concentrated in the communications  information services  media and technology industry sectors 
accordingly  an economic downturn could disproportionately impact these industry sectors causing us to be more vulnerable to losses in our portfolio and experience diminished demand for capital in these industry sectors and  consequently  our operating results may be negatively impacted 
at december   there were million of loans  or approximately of the investment portfolio  greater than days past due all of which were on non accrual status 
at december   there were million of loans  or approximately of the investment portfolio  on non accrual status 
the non accrual and past due loans primarily represented borrowers in the publishing  telecommunications and paging businesses 
our investment portfolio has experienced a decline in value as a result of the current economic recession 
for the year ended december   the net unrealized depreciation on our investments was million 
approximately of the investment decline in value can be attributed to pressure on the earnings of nine portfolio companies in the publishing and telecommunications industries 
unfavorable economic conditions also could increase our funding costs  limit our access to the capital markets or result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to us 
these events could prevent us from increasing our loan originations and investments and harm our operating results 
if we fail to qualify as a regulated investment company  we will have to pay corporate level taxes on our income and our income available for distribution would be reduced 
we will elect to be taxed for federal income tax purposes as a regulated investment company under subchapter m of the internal revenue code with the filing of our federal corporate income tax return for  which election will be effective as of january  if we can meet certain requirements  including source of income  asset diversification and distribution requirements  as well as if we continue to qualify as a business development company  we will qualify to be a regulated investment company and will not have to pay corporate level taxes on any income we distribute to our stockholders as dividends  allowing us to substantially reduce or eliminate our corporate level tax liability 
covenants and provisions in our credit facilities limit the ability of our subsidiaries and our securitization trusts to make distributions to us  which could affect our ability to make distributions to our stockholders and to maintain our status as a regulated investment company 
in addition  we may have difficulty meeting the requirement to make distributions to our shareholders because in certain cases we may recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income 
if we fail to qualify as a regulated investment company  we will have to pay corporate level taxes on all of our income whether or not we distribute it  which would substantially reduce the amount of income available for distribution to our stockholders 
even if we qualify as a regulated investment company  we generally will be subject to a corporate level income tax on the income we do not distribute 
moreover  if we do not distribute at least of our income  we generally will be subject to a excise tax 
see regulation as a business development company and certain us federal income tax considerations taxation as a regulated investment company 
because we will distribute substantially all of our income to our stockholders  we will continue to need additional capital to finance our growth 
if additional capital is unavailable or not available on favorable terms  our ability to grow will be impaired 
in order to satisfy the requirements applicable to a regulated investment company  we intend to distribute to our stockholders all of our income except for certain net capital gains 
we expect to elect to make deemed distributions to our stockholders of the retained net capital gains 
in addition  as a business development company  we generally will be required to meet a coverage ratio of total assets to total senior securities  which include all of our borrowings and any preferred stock we may issue in the future  of at least 
this requirement limits the amount that we may borrow 
because we will continue to need capital to grow our loan 
table of contents and investment portfolio  this limitation may prevent us from incurring debt and require us to raise additional equity at a time when it may be disadvantageous to do so 
additional financing may not be available on favorable terms  if at all  or may be restricted by the terms of our securitization facilities 
if additional funds are not available to us  we could be forced to curtail or cease our new lending and investment activities  and our net asset value could decrease 
we have substantial indebtedness and servicing our indebtedness could reduce funds available to grow our business 
as of december   we had million of outstanding borrowings under our securitization facilities 
as a result  our current financial structure has a high proportion of debt and our debt service is substantial 
as of december   the weighted average annual interest rate on all of our outstanding borrowings was 
in order for us to cover our annual interest payments on indebtedness  we must achieve annual returns on our december  total assets of at least 
our ability to service our debt depends largely on our financial performance and will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and competitive pressures 
in addition  our subsidiaries have sold some of our loans to trusts that serve as the vehicles for our securitization facilities  and we do not hold legal title to these assets 
however  we bear losses of principal and interest from defaults on these loans held by the trusts up to the amount of our retained interest in the trusts  which was approximately million as of december  our securitization facilities impose financial and operating covenants that restrict our business activities  including limitations that could hinder our ability to finance additional loans and investments or to make the distributions required to maintain our status as a regulated investment company under subchapter m of the internal revenue code 
borrowings  also known as leverage  magnify the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and  therefore  increase the risks associated with investing in our securities 
leverage is generally considered a speculative investment technique 
if the value of our consolidated assets increases  then leveraging would cause the net asset value attributable to our common stock to increase more than it otherwise would have had we not leveraged 
conversely  if the value of our consolidated assets decreases  leveraging would cause net asset value attributable to our common stock to decline more than it otherwise would have had we not leveraged 
similarly  any increase in our consolidated revenue in excess of consolidated interest expense on our borrowed funds would cause our net income to increase more than it would without the leverage 
any decrease in our consolidated revenue would cause net income to decline more than it would have had we not borrowed funds and could negatively affect our ability to make distributions on our common stock 
as a business development company  we generally are required to meet a coverage ratio of total assets to total borrowings and other senior securities  which include all of our borrowings and any preferred stock we may issue in the future  of at least 
if this ratio declines below  we may not be able to incur additional debt and may need to sell a portion of our investments to repay some debt when it is disadvantageous to do so  and we may not be able to make distributions 
at december   this ratio was approximately 
if we are not able to refinance our debt or able to do so on favorable terms  we would not be able to operate our business in the ordinary course 
our million variable funding securitization facility is scheduled to terminate on july   or sooner but not earlier than july  if the liquidity support provided to the facility is not renewed 
our million securitization facility is scheduled to terminate on february  or sooner upon repayment of our borrowings 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to extend the terms of these facilities or obtain sufficient funds to repay any amounts outstanding under these facilities before they expire or terminate either from a 
table of contents replacement facility or alternative debt or equity financing 
if we are unable to repay amounts outstanding under these facilities and are declared in default or are unable to refinance these facilities  we would not be able to operate our business in the regular course 
even if we are able to refinance our debt  we may not be able to do so on favorable terms 
you may not receive distributions 
we intend to make distributions on a quarterly basis to our stockholders 
we may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time 
in addition  due to the asset coverage test applicable to us as a business development company  we may be limited in our ability to make distributions 
see regulation as a business development company 
also  restrictions and provisions in our securitization facilities limit our ability to make distributions 
if we do not distribute a certain percentage of our income annually  we will suffer adverse tax consequences  including possible loss of our status as a regulated investment company 
see certain us federal income tax considerations taxation as a regulated investment company 
we cannot assure you that you will receive any distributions or distributions at a particular level 
we may have difficulty paying our required distributions if we recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and tax regulations  we include in income certain amounts that we have not yet received in cash  such as contracted payment in kind interest  which represents contractual interest added to the loan balance and due at the end of the loan term 
the increases in loan balances as a result of contracted payment in kind arrangements are included in income in advance of receiving cash payment  and are separately identified on our consolidated statements of cash flows 
since we may recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income  we may have difficulty meeting the requirement to distribute at least of our investment company taxable income to maintain our status as a regulated investment company 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and certain us federal income tax considerations taxation as a regulated investment company 
if we fail to manage our growth  our financial results could be adversely affected 
we have expanded our operations rapidly since purchasing our business from first union national bank in our growth has placed and could continue to place significant strain on our management systems and resources 
we must continue to refine and expand our marketing capabilities  our management of the investment process  our access to financing resources and our technology 
as we grow  we must continue to hire  train  supervise and manage new employees 
we may not develop sufficient lending and administrative personnel and management and operating systems to manage our expansion effectively 
if we are unable to manage our growth  our operations could be adversely affected and our financial results could be adversely affected 
if we need to sell any of our investments  we may not be able to do so at a favorable price and  as a result  we may suffer losses 
to maintain our qualification as a business development company and as a regulated investment company  we may have to dispose of investments if we do not satisfy one or more of the applicable criteria under the respective regulatory frameworks 
our investments are usually subject to contractual or legal restrictions on resale or are otherwise illiquid because there is usually no established trading market for such investments 
the illiquidity of most of our investments may make it difficult for us to dispose of them at a favorable price  and  as a result  we may suffer losses 

table of contents our business depends on our key personnel 
our future success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of bryan j 
mitchell  our chief executive officer  steven f 
tunney  our president and chief operating officer  b 
hagen saville  one of our executive vice presidents  and robert j 
merrick  our chief credit officer  as well as other key personnel 
mr 
mitchell was diagnosed in may with adenocarcinoma  a form of colon cancer  for which he was treated through surgery and a series of post operative treatments that ended in december mr 
mitchell s illness is in remission and has not significantly impaired his ability to perform his duties 
the loss of any of these key employees would likely have a significant detrimental effect on our business 
in addition  if any two of mr 
mitchell  mr 
saville  mr 
tunney or mr 
merrick cease to be actively involved in our management  the lender under one of our securitization facilities could  absent a waiver or cure  replace us as the servicer of the loans and declare a default 
fluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect our income 
a significant increase in market interest rates could harm our ability to attract new customers and originate new loans and investments  our non performing assets could increase and the value of our portfolio could decrease because our floating rate loan customers may be unable to meet higher payment obligations 
conversely  a significant decrease in interest rates would reduce our net income  all other things being equal 
approximately of the loans in our portfolio  based on amounts outstanding as of december   were at variable rates determined on the basis of a benchmark libor or prime rate and approximately were at fixed rates 
from april  to december   three month libor has declined from to 
a decrease in interest rates may reduce net income despite the increased demand for our capital that the decrease in interest rates may produce 
any change in regulation of our business could negatively affect the profitability of our operations 
changes in the laws  regulations or interpretations of the laws and regulations that govern business development companies  regulated investment companies or non depository commercial lenders could significantly affect our operations and our cost of doing business 
we are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations and are subject to judicial and administrative decisions that affect our operations 
if these laws  regulations or decisions change  or if we expand our business into jurisdictions that have adopted more stringent requirements than those in which we currently conduct business  we may have to incur significant expenses in order to comply or we might have to restrict our operations 
the bush administration dividend proposal could negatively impact the market perception of our stock relative to the stocks of non ric corporations 
recently  the bush administration proposed legislation intended to exempt from income taxation dividends that shareholders receive out of earnings that have been subject to corporate level taxation 
since the earnings of rics generally are not subject to corporate level taxation because of the dividends paid deduction  the proposal may not apply to some or all dividends paid by rics 
if such legislation were enacted  it could cause investors to view the stocks of certain non ric corporations as more attractive relative to the stocks of rics 
we cannot predict whether this proposal will be enacted or in what form it might be enacted 
we cannot predict what impact this proposal or any subsequent legislation might have on the value of our stock 
there may be other current or from time to time future legislation that may impact the market perception of our stock relative to other investments 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity refers to the change in earnings that may result from the changes in the level of interest rates 
our net interest income is affected by changes in various interest rates  including libor  prime rates and commercial paper rates 
over of our loan portfolio bears interest at a spread to libor  with the remainder bearing interest at a fixed rate or at a spread to a prime rate 
approximately of our loan portfolio has a libor floor  at various levels 
our interest rates on our borrowings are based on libor and commercial paper rates  with the majority based on libor 
we regularly measure exposure to interest rate risk 
we have interest rate risk exposure mainly from the portion of the commercial loan portfolio funded using stockholders equity 
our board of directors assesses interest rate risk and we manage our interest rate exposure on an ongoing basis 
the following table shows a comparison of the interest rate base for our outstanding commercial loans and our outstanding borrowings at december  and dollars in millions commercial loans borrowings commercial loans borrowings prime rate day libor day libor day libor commercial paper rate fixed rate total based on our december  balance sheet  for a basis point increase in interest rates  our annual interest income would increase by million and our annual interest expense would increase by million resulting in an increase in annual net income of million  assuming no changes in our investments or borrowing structure 
due to the imposition of libor floors  the impact of an additional basis point increase is different from the first basis point change discussed in the preceding sentence 
for that additional basis point increase in interest rates  our annual interest income would increase an additional million resulting in an increase in annual net income of an additional million  assuming no changes in our investments or borrowing structure 
for a basis point decrease in interest rates  our annual interest income would decrease by million and our annual interest expense would decrease by million  resulting in a decrease in annual net income of million  assuming no changes in our investment and borrowing structure 
as a business development company  we will use a greater portion of equity to fund our business than we have in the past 
accordingly  other things being equal  increases in interest rates will result in greater increases in our net interest income and reductions in interest rates will result in greater decreases in our net interest income compared with the effects of interest rate changes on our results under the more highly leveraged capital structure we have maintained in the past 
currently  we do not engage in hedging activities because we have determined that the cost of hedging the risks associated with interest rate changes outweighs the risk reduction benefit 
we monitor this position on an ongoing basis
