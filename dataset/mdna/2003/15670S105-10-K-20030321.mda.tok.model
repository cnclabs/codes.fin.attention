item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations corporate overview in  we adopted a strategy to focus on our two primary businesses envelopes and commercial printing and announced plans to divest our prime label and printed office products businesses  the filing products division of our envelope business and the digital graphics division of our commercial printing business 
in addition to the planned divestitures  we initiated a restructuring program to consolidate manufacturing facilities to improve our competitive position and implemented other initiatives to significantly improve operations  reduce costs and increase marketing effectiveness 
in february  we sold curtis inc  the distribution business included in our printed office products business 
in may  we sold our prime label business 
as of june  we had not received an offer for printxcel  also part of our printed office products business  that we considered consistent with its value 
because printxcel generates reliable cash flow and a satisfactory return on assets we concluded that it was not in our best interest to sell this business and we discontinued our efforts to do so 
this business is now an integral part of our strategy of expanding our print products and services to a larger customer base 
in august  we sold the filing products division of our envelope business 
we are continuing our efforts to sell certain digital graphics operations of our commercial printing business 
we have substantially completed the restructuring of mail well that began in mail well is now one company focused on producing products and services that help our customers deliver their messages more effectively 
we believe we are the world s largest manufacturer of envelopes 
we produce approximately billion envelopes annually in our envelope manufacturing facilities located throughout the united states and canada 
approximately of these envelopes are customized specifically for our customers for use in billing and remittance  direct mail advertising and specialty packaging 
the remaining are stock envelopes sold into the resale market 
we are one of the largest commercial printers in the united states 
we operate printing plants located strategically throughout the united states and one in canada 
we specialize in high impact printing  in which we print a wide range of premium printed products for national and regional customers  including annual reports  car brochures and brand marketing collateral  and general commercial printing for local and regional customers 
we are also a leading domestic supplier of customized and stock labels  mailers and printed business documents to small and mid size businesses generally through independent distributors of office products 
our printed office products business operates manufacturing plants strategically located throughout the united states 
the labels produced and sold by our printed office products division do not compete with those produced and sold by the now divested prime label business due to differences in customer base  distribution channels and production methods 
paper is our most significant raw material 
we purchase approximately  tons of paper annually for our businesses 
prices of uncoated papers  which are the principal grades of paper used to manufacture envelopes  increased in the fourth quarter of the costs of uncoated paper had declined approximately during after a year of stable prices in prices of coated papers  which are used principally in commercial printing  increased approximately in  decreased approximately in and remained flat in historical changes in paper pricing generally have not affected the operating results of our commercial printing business because we have been able to pass on paper price increases to our customers 
paper pricing has  however  impacted the operating margins of our envelope business 
when paper prices are rising  operating margins on our envelope products tend to be lower because we generally are not able to increase our prices as quickly as paper prices increase 
accordingly  since uncoated paper prices increased at the end of  operating margins of our envelope business will be negatively impacted in to the extent we are unable to increase the prices of our envelope products 
prior to  our growth was primarily due to our acquisition strategy 
we substantially curtailed our acquisitions in and in order to concentrate on implementing our strategic plan 
in  we acquired american business products  inc and four smaller companies 
the acquisitions have been accounted for as purchase transactions 
recording acquisitions in this manner impacts comparability of our financial statements because the results of each of the acquired companies are included in the consolidated results from the dates acquired 
when appropriate  we have noted the impacts of our acquisitions in the following discussions of our results 
consolidated results of operations the financial statements for all periods presented have been restated as required by generally accepted accounting principles to report the results of our prime label and curtis businesses as discontinued operations 
our printxcel business had also been reported as a discontinued operation prior to june since this business is no longer held for sale  the results of printxcel have been reclassified to be included in continuing operations for all periods presented 
the summary financial data set forth in the tables that follow present reported amounts as well as comparable financial data for new mail well 
the financial data presented for new mail well exclude the results of the prime label  curtis and filing products businesses sold in as well as the results of our digital graphics operations held for sale at december  new mail well results also exclude restructuring  impairments and other charges reported in the consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december   and the economic slowdown that began in continued to adversely affect the sales and margins of our businesses in  especially the portion of our commercial printing business related to print advertising and the direct mail segment of our envelope business 
in addition  the market for traditional business forms continues to decline due to the increasing use of laser printing technology by the end users of these products 
we do not expect significant increases in sales and margins until the markets we serve  especially advertising and direct mail  recover 
in the meantime  we will continue to control our costs and balance production with the needs of our customers 
sales year ended december change dollars in thousands reported    new mail well    excludes sales of the filing products division of our envelope business sold during and sales of certain digital graphics operations of our commercial printing business held for sale

we anticipate realizing additional benefits from the plant consolidations that were completed in as well as other cost improvement programs initiated during our focus in will be on improving customer service  product quality and manufacturing efficiencies

administrative expenses were reduced million 
we do not expect market conditions for commercial printing to improve significantly in sales in the second half of were improved over the first half  and we are hopeful that this trend will continue into over the last two years we have initiated programs to improve customer service  strengthen customer relationships  reduce costs and improve business processes 
we expect to realize the benefits of these initiatives in printed office products the following table presents the reported sales and operating income of our printed office products business  as well as sales and operating income excluding restructuring and other charges new printed office products

in  sales of new printed office products declined million  or  compared to sales in an explanation of the sales decline was as follows sales of traditional business forms were million lower in than in demand for business forms has been declining for several years as businesses have acquired laser printing capabilities 
also  the consolidation of two traditional document plants in affected revenues in since we were not able to retain all of the sales associated with the plants that were closed

in  we expect continued erosion in demand for traditional business forms 
however  we expect to stabilize sales in  by increasing sales of our specialty mailer products and several new label product initiatives 
we also expect to fully realize the benefits of the two plant consolidations  which were completed in liquidity and capital resources at december   our debt had been reduced million to million from the balance of million at december  we generated million of cash flow from operations compared to million in and million in the decrease in operating cash flow was due to the greater loss in and a smaller cash flow benefit from the reductions made in working capital in compared to reductions in working capital  which consist of current assets exclusive of cash and cash equivalents and net assets of discontinued operations  less current liabilities  exclusive of the current portion of long term debt  increased cash flow from operations by million in  million in and million in a portion of the decrease in working capital has been the result of the company s practice of extending payments to its suppliers  with their agreement  to better balance the days payable outstanding with the days sales outstanding 
the company s standard payment terms have been increased to days 
the impact of this practice on the amounts due to our suppliers over the last two quarters of has been less than million

loans made under this facility are issued on a revolving basis and are subject to availability and a borrowing base 
loans bear interest at a base rate or libor  plus a margin  and are secured by substantially all of our assets 
in august  we applied the net proceeds of million received from the sale of the filing products division of our envelope business to the reduction of our revolving loan balance 
on november   we redeemed the million of convertible subordinated notes due on that date 
the following table summarizes our cash payment obligations as of december  by year total cash long term debt operating leases obligations thereafter    total    at december   we had outstanding letters of credit of approximately million related to performance and payment guarantees 
in addition  we have issued letters of credit of million as credit enhancements in conjunction with other debt 
based on our experience with these arrangements  we do not believe that any obligations that may arise will be significant 
our credit ratings as of december  were as follows senior senior senior secured unsecured subordinated rating agency debt debt debt last update standard poor s bb bb b july moody s b b b february the terms of our existing debt do not have any rating triggers  and we do not believe that our current ratings will impact our ability to raise additional capital 
we expect to be able to fund our operations  capital expenditures and debt and other contractual commitments within the next year from internally generated cash flow and funds available under our senior credit facility 
at december   we had million of unused credit available under this credit facility 
seasonality and environment our commercial printing business experiences seasonal variations 
our revenues from annual reports are generally concentrated from february through april 
revenues associated with holiday catalogs and automobile brochures tend to be concentrated from july through october  and calendars from may to september 
as a result of these seasonal variations  we are at or near capacity in some facilities at certain times during these periods 
several consumer direct market segments served by our envelope business and certain segments of the direct mail market  experience seasonality  with a higher percentage of the volume of products sold to these markets occurring during the fourth quarter of the year 
this seasonality is due to the increase in sales to the direct mail market due to holiday purchases 
seasonality is offset by the diversity of our other products and markets  which are not materially affected by seasonal conditions 
environmental matters have not had a material financial impact on our historical operations and are not expected to have a material impact in the future 
critical accounting policies and judgments in preparing our financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis  including those related to bad debts  inventory valuations  property  plant and equipment  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring costs  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
in  upon adoption of sfas no 
we recorded a million impairment of the goodwill recorded by our commercial printing business as a change in accounting principle 
our estimate of this impairment was based on discounting the future cash flows of this business and comparisons to market multiples of other similar companies 
in preparing projected future cash flows  we used our judgment in projecting the profitability of this business  its growth in future years  the capital spending required  the working capital requirements and the selection of a discount rate 
in our comparisons to market multiples of other similar companies  we used our judgment in the selection of the companies used in the analysis 
we will reevaluate the carrying value of our goodwill as of december of each year  or earlier  if there are indications of impairment 
our evaluation as of december  indicated no additional impairment over what was recorded upon the adoption of sfas no 
on january  in  the decision was made to reinstate the printxcel business as an operating asset 
under generally accepted accounting principles  when a business that was held for sale is reinstated as a continuing operation  it is to be recorded at the lower of its carrying value or fair market value 
in  we reduced the carrying value of the net assets of this business to its net realizable value 
we based our determination of the net realizable value of this business on the advice provided to us by our financial advisors 
our internal valuations of this business support its current carrying value  which approximates its fair market value 
assets held for sale have been recorded at net realizable value 
the net realizable value of the assets held for sale is based on a letter of intent received from a prospective buyer 
we do not expect the actual proceeds to be significantly different from our estimates  however  until the sale is completed  the possibility exists that the actual proceeds could be materially different from our estimate 
we exercise judgment in evaluating our long lived assets for impairment 
we believe our businesses will generate sufficient cash flow to more than recover the investments we have made in property  plant and equipment and other intangibles recorded as a result of our acquisitions 
we are self insured for the majority of our workers compensation costs and group health insurance costs 
we rely on claims experience and the advice of consulting actuaries and administrators in determining an adequate liability for self insurance claims 
the determination of our tax provision is complex due to operations in tax jurisdictions outside the united states 
in addition  realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent upon our ability to generate future taxable income and future capital gains 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no

the company will adopt the provisions of sfas no 
as of january  and will reclassify extraordinary items from all prior periods into income from continuing operations upon adoption 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
provides guidance related to accounting for costs associated with disposal activities covered by sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets or with exit or restructuring activities previously covered by emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
supercedes eitf issue no 
in its entirety 
sfas no 
requires that costs related to exiting an activity or to a restructuring not be recognized until the liability is incurred 
sfas no 
will be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  in november  the fasb issued interpretation  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin requires a guarantor to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
fin also expands the disclosures required to be made by a guarantor about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
initial recognition and measurement provisions of fin are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified 
the adoption of the fair value provisions of this interpretation are not expected to have any impact on the financial statements of the company 
the disclosure requirements are effective immediately and are provided for in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas no 
also requires that disclosures of the pro forma effect of using the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation be displayed more prominently and in a tabular format 
additionally  sfas no 
requires disclosure of the pro forma effect in interim financial statements 
the transition and disclosure requirements of sfas no 
are effective for the company does not currently plan to transition to a fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation

forward looking information certain statements in this report  and in particular  statements found in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of generally  the words believe  expect  intend  estimate  anticipate  project  will and similar expressions identify forward looking statements  which generally are not historical in nature 
all statements which address operating performance  events or developments that we expect or anticipate will occur in the future are forward looking statements 
such statements reflect our current views of mail well with respect to future events and are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements 
as and when made  we believe that these forward looking statements are reasonable 
however  caution should be taken not to place undue reliance on any such forward looking statements since such statements speak only as of the date when made 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
in addition to those described elsewhere in this report the following are some of the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expected results described in or underlying our forward looking statements we reported losses for and primarily as a result of expenses related to our restructuring initiatives and the economic slowdown 
the slowdown in the economy has significantly impacted our sales 
reductions by our customers in spending on printed advertising material and direct mail promotions impacted sales of commercial printing and envelopes 
in addition  sales of traditional business forms by our printed office products business have declined 
our ability to return to profitability depends in part on our customers recovery from this slowdown and the realization of the benefits of our restructuring and other cost reduction initiatives 
we formed our company through the acquisition of over separate businesses 
until our business philosophy was generally to continue to operate these businesses as separate businesses operating autonomously in their historic markets 
in  we adopted our existing strategy described in this report which focuses on the integration of our businesses and operational improvements through the sale of non core assets  consolidation of facilities and sharing of best practices 
part of our strategy for growing market share includes market focused regionalization within our segments and training our sales force to offer our full array of products and services to existing and prospective customers 
this strategy is designed to capitalize upon the depth and breadth of our products and geographical footprint especially with large regional and national buyers of printed products 
to be successful with this part of our strategy certain of our customers will need to change the way they buy printed products as one stop shopping has not been traditionally available except through resellers 
in addition  our sales people will need to be intensely trained and change the way they focus on new customer opportunities because in the past they generally only sold the products offered at the location out of which they work 
we believe that this one stop shopping  total company strategy will be accepted by customers as a way to streamline the procurement process and thereby reduce procurement costs 
however  this strategy is generally untested and therefore there is no assurance that it will be successful 
in the past  we have grown rapidly through acquisitions 
although we believe that our experience in making acquisitions is an important asset  the terms of our senior credit facility limit the acquisitions that we may currently pursue 
to the extent that we pursue acquisitions  we cannot be certain that we will be able to identify and acquire other businesses on favorable terms or that  if we are able to acquire businesses on favorable terms  we will be able to successfully integrate the acquired businesses into our current business or profitably manage them 
the industries in which we compete are generally characterized by individual orders from customers or short term contracts 
most of our customers are not contractually obligated to purchase products or services from us 
most customer orders are for specific jobs  and repeat business largely depends on our customers satisfaction with the work we do 
although our business does not depend on any one customer or group of customers  we cannot be sure that any particular customer will continue to do business with us for any period of time 
in addition  the timing of particular jobs or types of jobs at particular times of year may cause significant fluctuations in the operating results of our various printing operations in any given quarter 
we depend to some extent on sales to certain industries such as the advertising and automotive industries 
we estimate that approximately of our commercial printing sales are related to advertising 
to the extent these industries experience downturns  as is currently the case in advertising  the results of our operations are adversely affected 
the printing industry in which we compete  including the printed office products industry  is extremely fragmented and highly competitive 
in the market  we compete against a number of large  diversified and financially stronger printing companies  as well as regional and local commercial printers  many of which are capable of competing with us on volume  price and production quality 
in the envelope market  we compete primarily with a few multi plant and many single plant companies servicing regional and local markets 
there currently is excess capacity in the markets in which we compete  which could result in excessive price competition 
we are constantly seeking ways to reduce our costs and become more efficient competitors 
however  we cannot be certain that these efforts will be successful or that our competitors will not be more successful in their similar efforts to reduce costs and become more efficient 
if we fail to reduce costs and increase productivity  we may face decreased profit margins in markets where we encounter price competition  which in turn could reduce our cash flow and profitability 
most envelopes used in the united states and canada are sent through the mail and as a result  postal rates can significantly affect envelope usage 
historically  increases in postal rates  relative to changes in the cost of alternative delivery means and or advertising media  have resulted in temporary reductions in the growth rate of mail sent  including direct mail  which is a significant portion of our envelope volume 
we cannot be sure that direct mail marketers will not reduce their volume as a result of any increases 
because rate increases in the us and canada are outside our control  we can provide no assurance that any increases in us and or canadian postal rates will not have a negative effect on the level of mail sent  or the volume of envelopes purchased  in either or both countries 
in such event  we would expect to experience a decrease in cash flow and profitability or financial position 
factors other than postal rates that detrimentally affect the volume of mail sent through the us and canadian postal systems may also negatively affect our business 
if the threats of mass bio terrorism in the us mail system persist  or if there is a perception of a lack of safety in the us or canadian postal systems  we cannot be sure that direct mail marketers will not reduce their volume as a result of any such persisting threats or insecurity  or that such decreases in demand will not have a negative effect on the level of mail sent or the volume of envelopes purchased 
as of december   we had approximately  full time employees  of whom approximately  were members of various local labor unions 
if our unionized employees were to engage in a concerted strike or other work stoppage  or if other employees were to become unionized  we could experience a disruption of operations  higher labor costs or both 
a lengthy strike could result in a material decrease in our cash flow or profitability 
paper costs represent a significant portion of our cost of materials 
changes in paper pricing generally do no affect the operating margins of our commercial printing and printed office products businesses because we historically have been able to pass on paper price increases and increased proceeds from waste paper sales 
paper pricing does  however  impact the operating margins of our envelope business because we generally are not able to increase our prices as quickly as paper prices increase 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to continue to pass on future increases in the cost of paper 
moreover  rising paper costs and their consequent impact on our pricing could lead to a decrease in our volume of units sold 
although we have been successful in negotiating favorable pricing terms with paper vendors  we cannot be certain we will be successful in negotiating favorable pricing terms in the future 
this may result in decreased sales volumes as well as decreased cash flow and profitability 
due to the significance of paper in the manufacture of most of our products  we depend on the availability of paper 
during periods of tight paper supply  many paper producers allocate shipments of paper based on the historical purchase levels of customers 
as a result of our large volume paper purchases from several paper producers  we generally have not experienced difficulty in obtaining adequate quantities of paper  although we have occasionally experienced minor delays in delivery 
although we believe that our attractiveness to vendors as a large volume paper purchaser will continue to enable us to receive adequate supplies of paper in the future  unforeseen developments in world paper markets coupled with shortages of raw paper could result in a decrease in supply  which in turn would cause a decrease in the volume of products we could produce and sell and a corresponding decrease in cash flow and profitability 
our business is highly dependent upon the demand for envelopes sent through the mail 
such demand comes from utility companies  banks and other financial institutions  among others 
our printing business also depends upon demand for printed advertising and business forms  among others 
customers increasingly use the internet and other electronic media to purchase goods and services  and for other purposes such as paying utility and credit card bills 
advertisers use the internet and other electronic media for targeted campaigns directed at specific electronic user groups 
large and small businesses use electronic media to conduct business  send invoices and collect bills 
as a result  we expect the demand for envelopes and other printed materials for these purposes to decline 
although we expect countervailing trends  such as the growth of targeted direct mail campaigns based upon mailing lists generated by electronic purchases  to cause overall demand for envelopes and other printed materials to continue to grow at rates comparable to recent historical levels  we cannot be certain that the acceleration of the trend towards electronic media such as the internet and other alternative media will not cause a decrease in the demand for our products 
our operations are subject to federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations  including those relating to air emissions  wastewater discharge  waste generation  handling  management and disposal  and remediation of contaminated sites 
in addition  some of the sellers from which we have bought businesses in the past have been designated as potentially responsible parties under the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended  or cercla  or similar legislation in canada  with respect to off site disposal of hazardous waste at two sites 
cercla imposes strict  and in certain circumstances joint and several  liability for response costs 
liability may also include damages to natural resources 
we believe that we have minimal exposure as a result of such designations  either because indemnities obtained in the course of acquisitions or because of the de minimis nature of the claims  or both 
we also believe that our current operations are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
we cannot be certain  however  that available indemnities will be adequate to cover all costs or that currently unknown conditions or matters  new laws and regulations  or stricter interpretations of existing laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our business or operations in the future 
our success will continue to depend to a significant extent on our executive officers and other key management personnel 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to retain our executive officers and key personnel or attract additional qualified management in the future 
in addition  the success of any acquisitions we may pursue may depend  in part  on our ability to retain management personnel of the acquired companies 
we do not carry key person insurance on any of our managerial personnel 
recently enacted and proposed changes in the laws and regulations affecting public companies  including the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of and rules proposed by the sec and the new york stock exchange could cause us to incur increased costs as we evaluate the implications of new rules and respond to new requirements 
the new rules could make it more difficult for us to obtain certain types of insurance  including directors and officer liability insurance  and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage 
the impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on the company s board of directors  or as executive officers 
we are presently evaluating and monitoring developments with respect to these new and proposed rules  and we cannot predict or estimate the amount of the additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs 
the foregoing list of important factors is not exclusive 
a further description of these and other risks and uncertainties may be found in our subsequent filings with the sec which can be found on our website discussed above 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks such as changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates  which may adversely affect results of operations and financial position 
risks from interest and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations are managed through normal operating and financing activities 
we do not utilize derivatives for speculative purposes  nor did we hedge interest rate exposure through the use of swaps and options or foreign exchange exposure through the use of forward contracts as of december  however  the board of directors have given management authority to engage in interest rate swaps and we are currently considering this option 
exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates relates primarily to our variable rate debt obligations 
the interest on this debt is the london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin 
at december  and  we had variable rate debt outstanding of million 
a increase in libor on the maximum amount of debt subject to variable interest rates  which is million  would increase our interest expense by million and reduce our net income by approximately million 
we have operations in canada  and thus are exposed to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates of the canadian dollar
