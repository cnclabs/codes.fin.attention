item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements about our plans and expectations of what may happen in the future 
forward looking statements are based on a number of assumptions and estimates that are inherently subject to significant risks and uncertainties  and our results could differ materially from the results anticipated by our forward looking statements as a result of many known or unknown factors  including  but not limited to  those factors discussed on pages under the heading risk factors 
see also the cautionary notice regarding forward looking statements set forth at the beginning of this report 
please read the following discussion in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the related notes contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview renal care group provides dialysis services to patients with chronic kidney failure 
as of december   the company provided dialysis and ancillary services to approximately  patients through outpatient dialysis centers in states  in addition to providing acute dialysis services to approximately hospitals 
renal care group s net revenue has been derived primarily from the following sources outpatient hemodialysis services  ancillary services associated with outpatient dialysis  primarily the administration of erythropoietin also known as epogen or epo and other drugs  home dialysis services  inpatient hemodialysis services provided to acute care hospitals and skilled nursing facilities  laboratory services  and management contracts with hospital based medical university dialysis programs 
most patients with end stage renal disease receive three dialysis treatments each week in an outpatient setting 
reimbursement for these services is provided primarily by the medicare esrd program based on rates established by the centers for medicare and medicaid services 
for the year ended december   approximately of the company s net revenue was derived from reimbursement under the medicare and medicaid programs 
medicare reimbursement is subject to rate and other legislative changes by congress and periodic changes in regulations  including changes that may reduce payments under the esrd program 
congress increased the medicare composite rate in by and by in neither congress nor cms approved an increase in the composite rate for either or the medicare composite rate applies to a designated group of outpatient dialysis services  including the dialysis treatment  supplies used for the treatment  certain laboratory tests and medications  and most of the home dialysis services provided by renal care group 
the company receives separate reimbursement outside the composite rate for some other services  laboratory tests  and drugs  including specific drugs such as epo and some physician ordered tests provided to dialysis patients 
if a patient has private health insurance  that patient s dialysis is typically reimbursed at rates significantly higher than medicare during the first months of treatment 
after that period medicare becomes the primary payor 
reimbursement for dialysis services provided pursuant to a hospital contract is negotiated with the individual hospital and is usually higher than the medicare composite rate 
because dialysis is a life sustaining therapy to treat a chronic disease  utilization is predictable and is not subject to seasonal fluctuations 
renal care group derives a significant portion of its net revenue and net income from the administration of epo 
epo is manufactured by a single company  amgen inc in april  amgen implemented its third epo price increase of in as many years 
this increase did not affect renal care group s results of operations in because renal care group s contract with amgen included price protection for all of the company s contract with amgen for generally provides that the company s pricing formula will remain in effect for as a result  the company believes  although it can give no assurances  that it will be able to mitigate a substantial portion of the price increase in 
table of contents critical accounting policies the securities and exchange commission has issued a financial reporting release  fr  cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies 
in accordance with that release  management has identified the following accounting policies that it considers critical to the business of renal care group 
management identified these policies based on their importance to the consolidated financial statements and on the degrees of subjectivity and complexity involved in these policies 
in addition to these critical policies  a summary of significant accounting policies is included in the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes  contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
net revenue and contractual provisions renal care group recognizes revenue net of contractual provisions as services are provided 
contractual provisions represent the difference between renal care group s gross billed charges and the amount the company expects to receive 
under the medicare esrd program  medicare reimbursement rates for outpatient dialysis treatments are fixed under a composite rate structure 
the composite rate applies to a designated group of outpatient dialysis services  including the dialysis treatment  supplies for the treatment  some laboratory tests and some medications 
there are other drugs  laboratory tests and services that are eligible for separate reimbursement outside the composite rate 
most state medicaid plans follow reimbursement methodologies that are similar to the medicare program  but other payors  particularly private insurance plans and managed care payors  reimburse renal care group under contractual arrangements 
each of these payor sources provides unique challenges to the process of recording contractual provisions 
renal care group has made significant investments in human resources and information systems to enable it to estimate the appropriate amount of contractual provisions as services are provided 
actual levels of reimbursement  however  are sometimes difficult to determine due to the complexity of the applicable regulations or contracts 
as a result  renal care group may in fact collect more or less than the amount it expects when the services are provided 
in addition  regulations and contracts may be changed  making system updates and maintenance necessary for estimating net revenue accurately 
as a result  management may make adjustments to the contractual provisions estimated by the system based on actual collection experience and other factors 
provision for doubtful accounts collecting outstanding accounts receivable is critical to renal care group s success 
renal care group s primary source of collection risk is related to the portion of its gross charges for which the patient is responsible 
the patients responsibility is typically between and of gross charges 
the company records its estimate of the provision for doubtful accounts in the period in which the revenue is recognized based on management s estimate of the net collectibility of the accounts receivable 
management estimates and monitors the net collectibility of accounts receivable based upon a variety of factors  including the analysis of payor mix  subsequent collection analysis and review of detailed agings of accounts receivable 
significant changes in payor mix or business office operations of renal care group could have a significant impact on renal care group s results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents self insurance accruals from time to time  renal care group is subject to medical malpractice or workers compensation claims or lawsuits in the ordinary course of business 
to mitigate a portion of this risk  the company maintains insurance for malpractice claims exceeding certain individual amounts and workers compensation claims exceeding certain individual and aggregate amounts 
the company estimates the self insured retention portion of the malpractice risks using third party actuarial calculations that include historical claims data  demographic factors and other assumptions 
workers compensation risks are estimated by the company using historical claims data and other assumptions 
the estimated accrual for malpractice and workers compensation claims could be significantly affected if current and future occurrences differ from historical claims trends 
while management monitors current claims closely and considers outcomes when estimating its insurance accruals  the complexity of the claims  the wide range of potential outcomes and changes in the legal climate often complicate the company s ability to make precise estimates 
impairment of goodwill and long lived assets renal care group reviews goodwill  long lived assets and identifiable intangibles for impairment at least once a year and at any other time management identifies events or changes in circumstances that indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to the discounted present value of future net cash flows management expects the asset to generate 
the computation of future net cash flows is often complex and includes subjective assumptions 
if management determines that assets are impaired  then the impairment is equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets  as determined by independent appraisals or estimates of discounted future cash flows
