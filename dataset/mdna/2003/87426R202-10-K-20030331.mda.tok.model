other matters the company s provision of telecommunication services is subject to government regulation 
changes in existing regulations could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s local telecommunication services are provided almost exclusively through the use of rboc unbundled network elements une  and it is primarily the availability of costs based une rates that enables the company to price its local telecommunications services competitively 
on december   the fcc initiated its so called une triennial review rulemaking in which it was to review all unes and determine whether rbocs should continue to be required to provide them to competitors 
the fcc has recently concluded its triennial review of local phone competition 
although the text of the order is not yet available  the decision appears to preserve the company s ability to use the unep for the provision of bundled telecommunications services pending further market by market analyses by the respective state commissions 
changes to the current rules and regulations or adverse judicial and administrative interpretations and rulings relating thereto that result in any curtailment in the availability of the local switching une or increase in costs that rbocs may charge for such elements would materially impair the company s ability to provide local telecommunications services 
such changes could eliminate the company s capability to provide local telecommunications services entirely unless the company is able to utilize another technology  which may not be available or available on economically feasible terms  or the company purchases  builds and implements its own local switching network  which would require significant additional capital expenditures by the company 
at december   a full valuation allowance had been provided against the company s net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets since the amounts and extent of the company s future earnings were not then determinable with a sufficient degree of probability to recognize the deferred tax assets in accordance with the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the fourth quarter of represented the fifth consecutive quarter of profitability for the company 
in the fourth quarter of  as part of the company s budgeting process  management evaluated the deferred tax valuation allowance and determined that a portion of this valuation allowance should be reversed  resulting in a non cash deferred income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of million 
beginning in  the company will record income taxes at a rate equal to the company s combined federal and state effective rates 
however  to the extent of available net operating loss carryforwards  the company will be shielded from paying cash income taxes for several years  other than alternative minimum taxes and some state taxes 
the company reviews the valuation allowances on a quarterly basis 
at december   the company had net operating loss nol carryforwards for federal income tax purposes of approximately million 
due to the change of ownership provisions of the internal revenue code section  the availability of the company s net operating loss and credit carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation against taxable income in future periods if a change of ownership of more than of the value of the company s stock should occur within a three year testing period 
many of the changes that affect these percentage change determinations  such as changes in the company s stock ownership  are outside the company s control 
a more than cumulative change in ownership for purposes of the section limitation occurred on august  and october  as a result of such changes  certain of the company s carryforwards are limited 
as of december   approximately million of nol carryforwards were limited to offset future income 
in addition  based on information currently available to the company  the company believes that the change of ownership percentage was approximately for the currently applicable three year testing period 
if  during the current three year testing period  the company experiences an additional more than ownership change under section  the amount of the nol carryforward available to offset future taxable income may be further and substantially reduced 
to the extent the company s ability to use these net operating loss carryforwards against any future income is limited  its cash flow available for operations and debt service would be reduced 
there can be no assurance that the company will realize the full benefit of the carryforwards 
the company is a party to a number of legal actions and proceedings arising from the company s provision and marketing of telecommunications services  as well as certain legal actions and regulatory investigations and enforcement proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business 
the company believes that the ultimate outcome of the foregoing actions will not result in liability that would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
however  it is possible that  because of fluctuations in the company s cash position  the timing of developments with respect to such matters that require cash payments by the company  while such payments are not expected to be material to the company s financial condition  could impair the company s ability in future interim or annual periods to continue to implement its business plan  which could affect its results of operations in future interim or annual periods 
while the company believes that it has access  albeit limited  to new capital in the public or private markets to fund its ongoing cash requirements  there can be no assurance as to the timing  amounts  terms or conditions of any such new capital or whether it could be obtained on terms acceptable to the company 
accordingly  the company anticipates that its cash requirements generally must be met from the company s cash on hand and from cash generated from operations 
based on its current projections for operations  the company believes that its cash on hand and its cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund its currently contemplated capital expenditures  its debt service obligations  including the increased interest expense of its outstanding indebtedness  and the expenses of conducting its operations for at least the next twelve months 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to realize its projected cash flows from operations  which is subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed above  or that the company will not be required to consider capital expenditures in excess of those currently contemplated  as discussed above 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debt  goodwill and intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
recognition of revenue the company derives its revenues from local and long distance phone services  primarily local services bundled with long distance services  long distance services  inbound toll free service and dedicated private line services for data transmission 
the company recognizes revenue from voice  data and other telecommunications related services in the period in which subscribers use the related service 
deferred revenue represents the unearned portion of local telecommunication services and features that are billed one month in advance 
in addition  deferred revenue at december  included a non refundable prepayment received in in connection with an amended telecommunications services agreement with shared technologies fairchild  inc the prepayment was amortized over the five year term of the agreement  which expired october the amount included in revenue was million in  and million in each of and allowance for doubtful accounts allowances for doubtful accounts are maintained for estimated losses resulting from the failure of customers to make required payments on their accounts 
the company reviews accounts receivable aging trends  historical bad debt trends  and customer credit worthiness through customer credit scores  current economic trends and changes in customer payment history when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of the company s carriers that pay access charges were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the company s accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million  as of december  valuation of long lived assets and intangible assets with a definite life the company reviews the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets  including intangibles with a definite life  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
when such events occur  the company compares the carrying amount of the assets to the undiscounted expected future cash flows from them 
factors the company considers important that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results significant changes in the manner of the company s use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the company s overall business significant negative industry or economic trends significant decline in the company s stock price for a sustained period and market capitalization relative to net book value if this comparison indicates there is impairment  the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is calculated by the excess of the net assets carrying value over their fair value and is typically calculated using discounted expected future cash flows 
management of the company believes that  for the year ended december   no events or changes in circumstances have occurred to trigger an impairment review 
goodwill goodwill represents the cost in excess of net assets of acquired companies 
effective january   with the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill comprised of goodwill acquired in the access one acquisition in august will not be amortized  but rather will be tested for impairment annually  and will be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired 
prior to january   goodwill and intangibles were amortized on a straight line basis over periods ranging from years to years 
impairment testing for goodwill is performed at a reporting unit level  the company determined that it has one reporting unit under the guidance of sfas no 
an impairment loss would generally be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
prior to january   goodwill was tested for impairment in a manner consistent with long lived assets and intangible assets with a definite life 
the company completed the transitional assessment of goodwill under the requirements of sfas and determined that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount  thus the goodwill is not considered impaired 
software development costs direct development costs associated with internal use computer software are accounted for under statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use and are capitalized  including external direct costs of material and services and payroll costs and benefits for employees devoting time to the software projects 
costs incurred during the preliminary project stage  as well as for maintenance and training  are expensed as incurred 
amortization is provided on a straight line basis over the shorter of years or the estimated useful life of the software 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets and reviews the amount of such allowance annually 
at december  a full valuation allowance had been provided against the company s net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets since the amounts and extent of the company s future earnings were not determinable with a sufficient degree of probability to recognize the deferred tax assets in accordance with the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no

legal proceedings the company is a party to a number of legal actions and proceedings arising from the company s provision and marketing of telecommunications services  as well as certain legal actions and regulatory investigations and enforcement proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business 
management s current estimated range of liability related to some of the pending litigation is based on claims for which management can estimate the amount and range of loss 
the company recorded the minimum estimated liability related to those claims  where there is a range of loss 
because of the uncertainties related to both the amount and range of loss on the remaining pending litigation  management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
as additional information becomes available  the company will assess the potential liability related to the company s pending litigation and revise its estimates 
such revisions in the company s estimates of the potential liability could materially affect its results of operations and financial position 
new accounting pronouncements effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which establishes the impairment approach rather than amortization for goodwill 
effective january   the company was no longer required to record amortization expense on goodwill  but instead is required to evaluate these assets for potential impairment at least annually and will test for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired 
an impairment loss would generally be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of a reporting unit 
in order to complete the transitional assessment of goodwill as required by sfas  the company was required to determine by june   the fair value of the reporting unit associated with the goodwill and compare it to the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill 
the company determined that it has one reporting unit under the guidance of sfas the fair value of the reporting unit was determined primarily using a discounted cash flow approach and quoted market price of the company s stock 
the amount of goodwill reflected in the balance sheet as of december  was million 
to the extent a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an indication would exist that the reporting unit s goodwill assets may be impaired and the company will have to perform the second step of the transitional impairment test 
the company completed the transitional assessment of goodwill and determined that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  thus goodwill is not considered impaired 
if  in the future  the company has to perform the second step of the transitional impairment test  the company will have to compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation in accordance with sfas  business combinations  to its carrying amount  both of which would be measured as of the date of adoption 
any transitional impairment charge would then be recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
the required impairment tests of goodwill may result in future period write downs

revenue reduction is required unless the consideration relates to a separate  identifiable benefit and the benefit s fair value can be established
