overview we were incorporated in june from our inception through december   our activities related primarily to establishing and operating a biotechnology research and development organization and developing relationships with our corporate collaborators 
our scientific and business development endeavors currently focus on novel transcription factors for the regulation of gene expression 
we have incurred net losses since inception and expect to incur losses in the future as we continue our research and development activities 
to date  we have funded our operations primarily through the issuance of equity securities  borrowings  payments from federal government research grants and from corporate collaborators and strategic partners 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our revenues have consisted primarily of revenues from our corporate partners for zfp tfs  contractual payments from strategic partners for research programs and research milestones  and federal government research grant funding 
we expect revenues will continue to fluctuate from period to period and there can be no assurance that new collaborations or partner fundings will continue beyond their initial terms 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses  laboratory supplies  allocated facilities costs  subcontracted research expenses  and intellectual property prosecution and license expenses 
research and development costs incurred in connection with company collaborator funded activities are expensed as incurred 
we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to attaining our strategic objectives 
we expect these expenses will increase significantly in the future as we continue to develop our zfp tf technology platform and pursue zfp therapeutic leads 
additionally  in order to develop zfp tfs as commercially relevant therapeutics  we expect to expend additional resources for regulatory and clinical expertise 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses for executive  finance and administrative personnel  professional fees  allocated facilities costs and other general corporate expenses 
as we pursue commercial development of our therapeutic leads we expect the business aspects of the company to become more complex 
we may be required in the future to add personnel and incur additional costs related to the maturity of our business 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
sangamo believes the following critical accounting policies have significant effect in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
accounting for revenue from funding of research activities  sale of zfp tfs  payment of upfront fees  and achievement of contract specific milestones involves management making estimates and judgments 
we recognize revenues from research collaboration agreements as earned upon achievement of the performance requirements of the agreements 
our collaboration agreements generally provide for research funding in defined research programs 
revenue related to these payments is earned when the work has been completed or delivery has occurred  the relative funding is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
payments received that are related to future performance are deferred and recognized as revenue as the performance requirements are fulfilled 
our revenue recognition involves determination of the period of continuing involvement  assessment of scientific progress  allocation of value to individual elements of multiple element arrangements and estimates regarding timing  level of effort and direct and indirect costs of work associated with the revenue 
stock based compensation 
we utilize stock and stock options as one means of compensating employees  consultants and others 
although this practice has no cash consequence  the accounting for stock based compensation can  under certain circumstances  result in a significant charge to our financial statements 
we amortize deferred stock compensation over the respective employee vesting period using the graded vesting method 
subsequently  if employees terminate during the vesting period of the stock based compensation  adjustments or reversals of previous charges are recognized upon termination 
charges for stock based compensation are expected to decrease in the future as deferred compensation related to our initial public offering and our acquisition of gendaq are fully amortized 
however  if new accounting pronouncements require or we choose to abandon accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and instead adopt financial reporting under financial accounting standards board statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation fas then future charges for stock based compensation would increase materially 
goodwill and patents impairment 
in connection with our acquisition of gendaq limited  in accordance with an independent valuation  we allocated million to goodwill and million to patents with estimated useful lives of years  the term of expected benefit 
the valuation in connection with the initial purchase price allocation and the ongoing evaluation for impairment of goodwill and intangible assets requires significant management estimates and judgment 
the purchase price allocation process requires management estimates and judgment as to expectations for various products and business strategies 
if any of the significant assumptions differ from the estimates and judgments used in the purchase price allocation  this could result in different valuations for goodwill and intangible assets 
once the purchase price allocation is established  we must test goodwill annually for impairment using a two step process as required by fas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
in addition  in certain circumstances  we must assess if goodwill should be tested for impairment between annual tests 
intangible assets with definite useful lives must be tested for impairment in accordance with fas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
when we conduct our impairment tests for goodwill and intangibles  factors that are considered important in determining whether impairment might exist include significant continued under performance compared to peers  significant changes in our underlying business and products  or other factors specific to each asset being evaluated 
any changes in key assumptions about the business and its prospects  or changes in market conditions or other externalities  could result in an impairment charge and such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations 
we performed the first of the required annual impairment tests for goodwill as of september   which resulted in a one time charge being taken for the entire balance of goodwill of million 
given that goodwill was determined to be impaired  we also assessed our long lived assets for impairment at that time  resulting in an additional one time charge of million being taken for the entire unamortized balance of patents 
acquisition of gendaq on july   we completed our acquisition of gendaq limited  a privately held biotechnology company located in the united kingdom 
we issued  shares of common stock in exchange for of the outstanding shares of gendaq s common stock 
we also reserved a total of  shares for issuance upon exercise of outstanding gendaq stock options  which were assumed in the transaction 
gendaq had a research and development organization with a focus and research activities similar to ours 
in february  we made the decision to begin consolidation of our gendaq operations from the united kingdom to our richmond  california headquarters 
the decision followed a post acquisition review that was initiated in october where we evaluated technology  personnel  costs  and various alternatives to maximize the synergy between sangamo and gendaq 
as this review was initiated after the acquisition was completed  and the final decision to consolidate was not made until february  the decision had no impact on our accounting for the acquisition reported in the gendaq facility was closed september  results of operations years ended december   and total revenues 
total revenues consisted of revenues from collaboration agreements  strategic partnerships and federal government research grants 
revenues from our corporate collaboration and strategic partnering agreements were million in  compared to million in  and million in the increases in and over were principally attributable to revenues recognized from a therapeutics partnership signed with edwards lifesciences corporation edwards in january and extended in november as well as incremental universal genetools agreements signed during both years 
revenues decreased from to by  as a function of less revenues recognized from collaborative agreements and strategic partnerships partially offset by increased grant revenues 
for  the largest portion of revenue from the edwards partnership was for extended research and development funding 
revenues attributable to milestone achievement and collaborative research and development performed under the edwards agreement were million  million and  for  and  respectively 
costs of the edwards partnership approximated revenues 
we expect revenues from strategic partnerships to continue to increase as additional agreements are signed or existing agreements are expanded 
federal government research grant revenues were  in   in  and  in the increase in represented the continuation of a grant which began in in addition to a new grant begun approximately mid year 
the decrease in was principally due to an increased focus on corporate collaborations as existing federal research government grants ended 
we plan to continue to apply for federal government research grants 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million in  compared to million in  and million in the decrease in was due principally to the consolidation of the research activities at gendaq  our wholly owned uk subsidiary  into our richmond operations 
the increase in was primarily due to the acquisition of gendaq which increased research and development staffing and resulted in higher personnel and associated laboratory supply costs 
included in research and development expenses was million  million  and million in  and  respectively  in stock based compensation expense  which decreased year over year as a result of the application of the graded vesting method of deferred compensation amortization 
our current research and development programs are focused on the advancement of our zfp tf technology for several potential applications 
among these are zfp therapeutics for cardiovascular disease  cancer and neuropathic pain  zfp tf engineered cell lines for drug screening  antibody development and enhancement of the production yields of protein pharmaceuticals  zfp tfs for the discovery and validation of genes and drug targets  and zfp tfs for applications in agricultural biotechnology 
below is a summary of our programs and the development phase of the leading application program phase zfp therapeutics preclinical zfp targeted gene correction research zfp tf engineered cell lines for small molecule drug discovery research marketing zfp tf engineered cell lines for therapeutic human monoclonal antibody development research marketing zfp tf engineered cell lines for the manufacturing of protein pharmaceuticals research marketing discovery and validation of gene targets universal genetools marketing in vivo research models research agricultural biotechnology research general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million in  as compared to million in  and million in included in general and administrative expenses was  million  and million in   and  respectively  of stock based compensation expense 
the increase in general and administrative expenses  other than stock based compensation expense  from to and was due to additional costs associated with being a public company  as well as incremental personnel costs to support our expanded research and development activities and development of our zfp tf technology 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase in the future to support continued growth of our research and development efforts 
restructuring charge 
restructuring charges of  related to the closure of the gendaq facility were recorded in these expenses primarily represent incremental employee restructuring costs and a loss on disposal of fixed assets of  impairment charges 
during  in accordance with fas no 
 the company performed the required two step annual impairment test of goodwill 
in the first step of the analysis  we compared the carrying value of the company to its fair value and determined that goodwill was impaired 
the fair value of the company was determined using the income approach 
the income approach focuses on the income producing capability of an asset  measuring the current value of the asset by calculating the present value of its future economic benefits such as cash earnings  cost savings  tax benefits and proceeds from disposition incorporating current equity market conditions in the united states  industry specific volatility factors  general equity market forecasts  the risk free rate for the use of funds and the expected rate of inflation 
the company recognized an impairment charge of million  representing the entire capitalized balance of goodwill at the time of the test 
fas requires that if an impairment test of goodwill and any other asset is required at the same time  impairment tests of all other assets should be completed and reflected in the carrying value of the company prior to the completion of the goodwill impairment test 
if it is determined that an asset is not recoverable  fas directs that an impairment loss should be recognized based on the excess of its carrying value over its fair value 
impairment tests of the company s long lived assets were conducted in accordance with fas based upon the results of this review  we concluded that the carrying amount of patents was not recoverable 
the company recognized an impairment loss of million  representing the entire unamortized balance of patents 
management assessed all other assets as being recoverable 
in process research and development expenses 
as a part of sangamo s million cost to acquire gendaq  million was expensed as research and development in the third quarter of in process research and development represents that portion of the purchase price of the acquisition related to the research and development activities which i have not demonstrated their technological feasibility  and ii have no alternative future uses 
sangamo recognized an expense of million upon consummation of the transaction 
the amount of in process research and development was determined based on an analysis using the risk adjusted cash flows expected to be generated by the products that result from the in process projects 
the analysis included forecasted future cash flows that were expected to result from the progress made on each of the in process projects prior to the purchase dates 
these cash flows were estimated by first forecasting  on a product by product basis  total revenues expected from sales of the first generation of each in process product  as well as expected expenses to complete in process research and development for each project 
appropriate operating expenses and cash flow adjustments were deducted from the forecast to establish projected net cash flows for the in process technology 
finally  these net returns were discounted to a present value at discount rates that incorporate both the weighted average cost of capital relative to the biotechnology industry and the company as well as the product specific risk associated with the purchased in process research and development products 
the product specific risk factors included each product in each phase of development  type of molecule under development  likelihood of regulatory approval  manufacturing process capability  scientific rationale  pre clinical safety and efficacy data  target product profile and development plan 
the overall discount rate used for the purchase valuation ranged from to depending upon the stage of completion of each product and the risks associated with each  which represents a significant risk premium to our weighted average cost of capital 
the forecast data in the analysis was based on internal product level forecast information maintained by management in the ordinary course of managing the business 
the inputs used in analyzing in process research and development were based on assumptions  which management believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
these assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and no assurance can be given that unanticipated events and circumstances will not occur 
a brief description of projects that were included in the in process research and development charge is set forth below 
projects subsequently added to the research and development pipeline are not included 
since the acquisition date  there has been no significant progress in the development of the projects listed 
at the time of the acquisition  management estimated that research and development expenditures of at least to million will be required to complete the in process projects 
project description indication phase of development estimated substantial completion date fair value in millions hiv therapeutic product candidate pre clinical anti inflammatory therapeutic product candidate pre clinical epo therapeutic product candidate pre clinical insulin therapeutic product candidate pre clinical functional genomics gene regulation product pre marketing agriculture gene regulation product pre marketing interest income  net 
net interest income was million in  as compared to million in  and million in the decline from to reflects lower cash and investment balances due to the utilization of cash to fund operations and declining interest rates in other income 
during  we recognized a net gain of  on foreign currency translations 
of that gain   represents cumulative currency translation recognized as a result of the closure of our gendaq facility in the uk prior to the closure of our gendaq facility currency translation gains or losses were reported as a component of equity 
we incurred net operating losses in   and  and consequently we did not pay any federal  state or foreign income taxes 
deemed dividend upon issuance of convertible preferred stock in january  we sold  shares of series c convertible preferred stock for net proceeds of million 
subsequent to the commencement of the initial public offering process  sangamo re evaluated the fair value of its common stock as of january accordingly  the incremental fair value  limited to the amount of the proceeds received of million  is deemed to be the equivalent of a preferred stock dividend 
sangamo recorded the deemed dividend at the date of issuance by offsetting charges and credits to preferred stock  without any effect on total stockholders equity 
the preferred stock dividend increases the loss applicable to common stockholders in the calculation of basic net loss per share for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities  payments from corporate collaborators  federal government research grants and financing activities such as a bank line of credit 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents  investments and interest receivable totaling million 
net cash used in operating activities was million in  million in  and million in in all periods  net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to funding of net operating losses 
net cash provided by used in investing activities was million in  million in  and million in included in was million of net cash acquired in the gendaq acquisition 
cash was used during these periods to purchase investments and property and equipment and was offset by the maturities and sale of available for sale securities 
net cash provided by financing activities during and was  and  respectively  primarily from proceeds from issuance of common stock 
net cash provided by financing activities during was million  primarily as a result of the company s initial public offering as well as proceeds received from issuance of convertible notes which converted at the time of our initial public offering 
we believe that the available cash resources  funds received from corporate collaborators  strategic partners and federal government research grants will be sufficient to finance our operations for at least two years 
as of december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  to offset any future taxable income 
we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately  and  respectively 
if not used  net operating loss and credit carryforwards will begin to expire in use of the net operating losses and credits may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code of the annual limitation may result in the expiration of our net operating losses and credits before they can be used 
also  if we do not become profitable  we will not be able to use these net operating losses and credits 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  we had contractual obligations and commercial commitments as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years operating leases  unconditional purchase obligations license obligations total contractual obligations   operating leases consist of base rents for facilities we occupy in richmond  california 
unconditional purchase obligations consist of a commitment to purchase a specified volume of services in from one of our vendors 
license obligations consist of ongoing license maintenance fees and royalties due from sales of zfp tfs 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities fas 
fas eliminates emerging issues task force issue no 
liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
under fas  liabilities for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity are recognized when the liabilities are incurred  and fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liabilities 
this statement is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the provisions of fas no 
are required to be applied prospectively after the adoption date to newly initiated exit activities  and may affect the timing of recognizing future restructuring costs  as well as the amounts recognized 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees  including residual value guarantees issued in conjunction with operating lease agreements 
it also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee  the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  our adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the financial accounting standards board issued emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a company for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
eitf addresses when and how an arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting 
eitf provides guidance with respect to the effect of certain customer rights due to company nonperformance on the recognition of revenue allocated to delivered units of accounting 
eitf also addresses the impact on the measurement and or allocation of arrangement consideration of customer cancellation provisions and consideration that varies as a result of future actions of the customer or the company 
finally  eitf provides guidance with respect to the recognition of the cost of certain deliverables that are excluded from the revenue accounting for an arrangement 
the provisions of eitf will apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  sangamo is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of eitf will have on its consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
fas amends fas accounting for stock based compensation to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  fas amends the disclosure requirements of fas to require more prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the additional disclosure requirements of fas are effective for fiscal years ending after december  we have elected to continue to follow the intrinsic value method of accounting as prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  to account for employee stock options 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash equivalents and investments 
the investments are available for sale 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we attempt to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default and market risks 
our cash and investments policy emphasizes liquidity and preservation of principal over other portfolio considerations 
we select investments that maximize interest income to the extent possible within these guidelines 
we satisfy liquidity requirements by investing excess cash in securities with different maturities to match projected cash needs and limit concentration of credit risk by diversifying our investments among a variety of high credit quality issuers 
we mitigate default risk by investing in only investment grade securities 
the portfolio includes marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
all investments have a fixed interest rate and are carried at market value  which approximates cost 
if market interest rates were to increase by percent from december   the fair value of our portfolio would decline by less than  the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from an immediate hypothetical shift in market interest rates and assumes ending fair values include principal plus accrued interest 
our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk is immaterial
