the determination of the allowance for loan losses is based on management s evaluation of the potential losses in the loan portfolio considering  among other relevant factors  repayment status  borrowers ability to repay  collateral and current foreseeable economic conditions 
the valuation methodology has been consistently applied since  when current management applied a more conservative view to the assumptions utilized in determining the specific reserves to be allocated to each credit 
these evaluations take into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  economic conditions that may affect the borrower s ability to repay including the timing of future payments  overall quality  analysis of prior and current loss experience and a review of specific problem loans 
the allowance reflects expected losses resulting from the analysis of specific credits and historical loss experience for each loan category 
the bank utilizes its internal loan gradings for commercial loans in conjunction with historical loss experience for loans of each grade level and current economic trends as parts of its analysis in determining the adequacy of its allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is calculated using a written  systematic methodology approved by a committee of the bank s board of directors 
the methodology includes specific allocations for known and potential impaired loans  identified concentrations of credit  unfunded  legally binding commitments to lend  economic trends  collateral value trends  new loan volume  and delinquent and non accrual loan balances 
the bank s trailing eight quarter net charge off experience is utilized to determine the appropriate general allocations 
the methodology is consistently applied on a monthly basis and a summary report presented for ratification to the bank s board of directors

these sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with caution 
as the figures indicate  changes in fair value based on a variation in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in the assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear 
also  the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the mortgage servicing asset is calculated independently without changing any other assumption 
in reality  changes in one factor may result in changes in another for example  changes in the prepayment rate estimates could result in changes in the discount rates  which might magnify or counteract the sensitivities

the corporation s asset liability committee alco is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position of the corporation and establishing policies to monitor and limit the exposure to interest rate risk 
since nearly the corporation s entire interest rate risk exposure relates to the financial instrument activity of the bank  the bank s board of directors review the policies and guidelines established by alco 
the primary objective of asset liability management is to provide an optimum and stable net interest margin  after tax return on assets and return on equity capital  as well as adequate liquidity and capital 
interest rate risk is monitored through the use of two complementary measures dynamic gap analysis and earnings simulation models 
while each of the measurement techniques has limitations  taken together they represent a reasonably comprehensive tool for measuring the magnitude of interest rate risk inherent in the corporation 
the dynamic gap analysis measures the amount of repricing risk associated with the balance sheet at a specific point in time 
expected cash flows from fixed rate instruments are defined utilizing contractual maturities and anticipated cash flows through early repayment of loans  early calls and paydowns of securities and early withdrawals of deposits 
variable rate instrument s repricing frequencies are categorized according to their earliest repricing opportunity 
core deposits with non contractual maturities are included in the gap repricing distributions based on historical patterns of pricing behavior 
the earnings simulation model forecasts earnings for a one year horizon frame under a variety of interest rate scenarios 
management evaluates the impact of the various rate simulations against earnings in a stable interest rate environment 
the most recent model projects net income would decrease by if interest rates would immediately fall by basis points and increase by if interest rates would immediately rise by basis points 
at december  the model projected net income would decrease by if interest rates would immediately fall by basis points and would increase by if interest rates would immediately rise by basis points 
the projected changes in net income include the projected changes in net interest income from the table below as well as projected changes in income from gains on sale of mortgage loans and projected adjustments to mortgage servicing assets and associated derivatives 
management believes this asset sensitive position for the one year time horizon is within acceptable levels of risk tolerance 
the earnings simulation model includes assumptions about how the various components of the balance sheet and rate structure are likely to react through time in different interest rate environments 
these assumptions are derived from historical analysis and management s outlook 
also include are estimates and assumptions regarding the impact to earnings from changes in the valuation allowance for servicing assets  gains on sale of mortgage loans and changes in the volume of interest rate floors 

table of contents the following table shows the projected changes in net interest income and the economic value of equity based on a series of interest rate shocks rate shock scenario net interest income economic value of equity down up board approved limit the economic value of equity is a measure used to determine the risk of changes to the value of equity from interest rate changes and incorporates the duration of assets and liabilities as well as their sensitivity to interest rate changes 
interest rate sensitivity is managed through the use of security portfolio management techniques  the use of fixed rate long term borrowings from the fhlb  the establishment of rate and term structures for time deposits and loans  the sale of long term fixed rate mortgages through the secondary mortgage market and interest rate swaps  caps and floors
