table of contents foreign currency and operations risk international investments represent  and are expected to continue to represent  a significant portion of the company s total assets 
the company currently has international operations in canada  argentina  bolivia  yemen and italy 
for  the company s operations in argentina and canada accounted for approximately percent and percent  respectively  of the company s revenues and percent and percent  respectively  of the company s total assets 
during  the company s operations in argentina and canada represented its only foreign operations accounting for more than percent of its revenues or total assets 
the company continues to identify and evaluate international opportunities  but currently has no binding agreements or commitments to make any material international investment 
as a result of such significant foreign operations  the company s financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates  weak economic conditions or changes in the political climate in these foreign countries 
historically  the company has not used derivatives or other financial instruments to hedge the risk associated with the movement in foreign currencies 
however  the company evaluates currency fluctuations and will consider the use of derivative financial instruments or employment of other investment alternatives if cash flows or investment returns so warrant 
the company s international operations may be adversely affected by political and economic instability  changes in the legal and regulatory environment and other factors 
for example local political and economic developments could restrict or increase the cost of the company s foreign operations  exchange controls and currency fluctuations could result in financial losses  royalty and tax increases and retroactive tax claims could increase costs of the company s foreign operations  expropriation of the company s property could result in loss of revenue  property and equipment  civil uprisings  riots and wars could make it impractical to continue operations  adversely affect both budgets and schedules and expose the company to losses  import and export regulations and other foreign laws or policies could result in loss of revenues  repatriation levels for export revenues could restrict the availability of cash to fund operations outside a particular foreign country  and laws and policies of the us affecting foreign trade  taxation and investment could restrict the company s ability to fund foreign operations or may make foreign operations more costly 
the company does not currently maintain political risk insurance 
however  the company will consider obtaining such coverage in the future if it deems conditions so warrant 
canada 
with the acquisition of cometra in december and the acquisition of genesis in may  the company now has significant producing operations in canada 
the company views the operating environment in canada as stable and the economic stability as good 
substantially all of the company s canadian revenues and costs are denominated in canadian dollars 
while the value of the canadian dollar does fluctuate in relation to us dollar  the company believes that any currency risk associated with its canadian operations would not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
the exchange rate at december   was us c as compared to us c at december  argentina 
beginning in  peronist carlos menem  as newly elected president of argentina  and domingo cavallo  as his minister of economy  set out to reverse economic decline through free market reforms such as open trade 
the key to their plan was the law of convertibility under which the peso was tied to the us dollar at a rate of one peso to one us dollar 
between and the plan succeeded 
with the risk of devaluation apparently removed  capital came in from abroad and much of argentina s state owned assets were privatized 
during this period  the economy grew at an annual average rate of percent  the highest in the region 

table of contents however  the convertibility plan left argentina with few monetary policy tools to respond to outside events 
a series of external shocks began in prices for argentina s commodities stopped rising  the dollar appreciated against other currencies  and brazil  argentina s main trading partner  devalued its currency 
argentina began a period of economic deflation  but failed to respond by reforming government spending 
during  argentina s budget deficit exceeded billion and its sovereign debt reached billion 
as a result of economic instability and substantial withdrawals from the banking system  in early december  the argentine government  with fernando de la rua as president and domingo cavallo as minister of economy  instituted restrictions that prohibit foreign money transfers without central bank approval and limit cash withdrawals from bank accounts for personal transactions in small amounts with certain limited exceptions 
while the legal exchange rate remained at one peso to one us dollar  financial institutions were allowed to conduct only limited activity due to these controls  and currency exchange activity was effectively halted except for personal transactions in small amounts 
on january   the argentine government abolished the one peso to one us dollar legal exchange rate 
on january   decree created a dual exchange market whereby foreign trade transactions were conducted at an official exchange rate of pesos to one us dollar and other transactions were conducted in a free floating exchange market 
on february   decree unified the dual exchange markets and allowed the peso to float freely with the us dollar 
the exchange rate at december   was pesos to one us dollar 
the devaluation of the peso reduced the company s gas revenues and peso denominated costs 
oil revenues remain valued on a us dollar basis 
on february   decree required all contracts that were previously payable in us dollars to be payable in pesos 
pursuant to an emergency law passed on january   us dollar obligations between private parties due after january   were liquidated in pesos at a negotiated rate of exchange which reflected a sharing of the impact of the devaluation 
the company s settlements in pesos of the existing us dollar denominated agreements have been completed  thus future periods will not be impacted by this mandate 
this government mandated equitable sharing of the impact of the devaluation resulted in a reduction in oil revenues from domestic sales for of approximately million  or 
per argentine barrel produced or 
per total company barrel produced 
the company s argentine lease operating costs were also reduced as a result of this mandate and the positive impact of devaluation on the company s peso denominated costs  which essentially offset the negative impact on argentine oil revenues 
on february   the argentine government announced a percent tax on oil exports  effective march  the tax is limited by law to a term of no more than five years 
the tax of percent is applied on the sales value after the tax  thus the net effect is percent 
the company currently exports approximately percent of its argentine oil production 
the company believes that this export tax will have the effect of decreasing all future argentine oil revenues not only export revenues by the tax rate for the duration of the tax 
the us dollar equivalent value for domestic argentine oil sales now paid in pesos has generally moved to parity with the us dollar denominated export values  net of the export tax 
the adverse impact of this tax has been partially offset by the net cost savings resulting from the devaluation of the peso on peso denominated costs and is further reduced by the argentine income tax savings related to deducting the impact of the export tax 
the export tax is not deducted in the calculation of royalty payments 
since may  many of argentina s important economic indicators have stabilized 
the central bank s foreign currency reserves have risen from a low of billion in to a recent high on march   of billion 
the exchange rate has remained stable at or below approximately pesos to one us dollar and the february   exchange rate was pesos to one us dollar 
monthly inflation has decreased from a high of percent for the month of april to an average of less than two percent per month from may to december with january inflation of percent 
inflation for all of was approximately percent 
after a year of negotiations  the international monetary fund imf approved a billion dollar debt rollover agreement on january  while only short term in nature  the package is designed to allow stability to continue at least through the presidential election process by rescheduling all imf debts falling due between january and august of as part of the agreement  the government agreed to raise its primary budget surplus target to percent of the country s gross domestic product 

table of contents the plan set in motion by current president eduardo duhalde to transition the government back into the hands of an elected president remains in place 
general elections are scheduled for april  if necessary a runoff election between the top two candidates will be held during may president duhalde has indicated that the transition of government will take place on may   after elections are complete 
on january   at the argentine government s request  crude oil producers and refiners agreed to cap amounts payable for domestic sales occurring during the first quarter at per bbl 
the producers and refiners further agreed that the difference between the actual price and the capped price would be payable once actual prices fall below the cap 
the debt payable under the agreement accrues interest at percent 
the total debt will be collected by invoicing future deliveries at per bbl after actual prices fall below the capped price 
additionally  the agreement allowed for renegotiation if the west texas intermediate reference price exceeded per bbl for ten consecutive days  which occurred on february on february   the agreement between the producers and the refiners was modified to limit the amount payable from refiners to producers for deliveries occurring between february   and march  while the per bbl payable cap was maintained  under the modified terms refiners have no obligation to pay producers for sales values that exceed per bbl 
furthermore  interest for debts established during this period was reduced to seven percent 
the company expects to sell  net bbls of its argentine oil production under the original terms of this agreement and  net bbls of its argentine oil production under the modified terms of this agreement 
bolivia 
since the mid s  bolivia has been undergoing major economic reform  including the establishment of a free market economy and the encouragement of foreign private investment 
economic activities that had been reserved for government corporations were opened to foreign and domestic bolivian private investments 
barriers to international trade have been reduced and tariffs lowered 
a new investment law and revised codes for mining and the petroleum industry  intended to attract foreign investment  have been introduced 
elections held during june marked the sixth consecutive democratic election held in bolivia since  representing the longest period of constitutional democratic government in the country s history 
coalitions were formed among the two leading political parties allowing gonzalo sanchez de lozada to win the runoff election 
since election  sanchez de lozada s government has been working to improve the economic and fiscal framework in order to facilitate new loan agreements from the imf 
after violent protests to his proposed tax increases and cuts in government spending in early  president sanchez de lozada was forced to reorganize his government 
the government s proposed budget for has now been withdrawn  and new budget plans will likely be proposed with support from the multilateral lending community 
also in an attempt to narrow budget deficits  the government has announced new taxes on oil refiners 
the oil refiners have  in turn  sued the government 
while the final outcome of the newly announced tax on refiners remains unclear  the company expects to receive lower prices for domestic oil sales as a result of these taxes 
in  the company s bolivian oil production accounted for less than one percent of the company s total production from continuing operations on an equivalent barrel basis 
in  the boliviano replaced the peso at the rate of one million pesos to one boliviano 
the exchange rate is set daily by the government s exchange house  the bolsin  which is under the supervision of the bolivian central bank 
foreign exchange transactions are not subject to any controls 
the exchange rate at december   was bolivianos to one us dollar
