item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following discussion and analysis is based upon our financial statements as of the dates and for the periods presented in this section 
you should read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes contained elsewhere in this report 
we were incorporated in october in february  we entered into a joint venture with at t wireless 
as part of the agreement  at t wireless contributed to us personal communications services licenses covering mhz of authorized frequencies in a contiguous geographic area encompassing portions of virginia  north carolina  south carolina  tennessee  georgia and kentucky in exchange for an equity position in triton 
as part of the transaction  we were granted the right to be the exclusive provider of wireless mobility services using equal emphasis co branding with at t within our region 
on june   we acquired an existing cellular system serving myrtle beach and the surrounding area from vanguard cellular systems of south carolina  inc in connection with this acquisition  we began commercial operations and earning recurring revenue in july we integrated the myrtle beach system into our personal communications services network as part of our initial network deployment 
substantially all of our revenues prior to were generated by cellular services provided in myrtle beach 
our results of operations do not include the myrtle beach system prior to our acquisition of that system 
we began generating revenues from the sale of personal communications services in the first quarter of as part of our initial personal communications services network deployment 
since our initial network deployment  we have successfully launched and offered personal communications service to approximately million people in all of our markets 
critical accounting polices and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we recognize revenues as services are rendered 
unbilled revenues result from service provided from the billing cycle date to the end of the month and from other carrier s customers using our network 
activation revenue is deferred and recognized over the estimated subscriber s life 
equipment sales are a separate earnings process from other services offered by triton and are recognized upon delivery to the customer and reflect charges to customers for wireless handset equipment purchases 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our subscribers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of a material portion of our subscribers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions 
table of contents about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period we made that determination 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period we made that determination 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets  other than indefinite lived intangible assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results or significant changes in the manner of use of the assets or in the strategy for our overall business 
the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
when we determine that the carrying value of a long lived asset is not recoverable  we measure any impairment based upon a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate we determined to be commensurate with the risk involved 
our primary indefinite lived intangible assets are fcc licenses 
we test investments in fcc licenses for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fcc licenses may be impaired 
the impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value with the carrying value 
we aggregate all of our fcc licenses for the purpose of performing the impairment test as the licenses are operated as a single asset and  as such  are essentially inseparable from one another 
revenue we derive our revenue from the following sources service 
we sell wireless personal communications services 
the various types of service revenue associated with wireless communications services for our subscribers include monthly recurring charges and monthly non recurring airtime charges for local  long distance and roaming airtime used in excess of pre subscribed usage 
our customers roaming charges are rate plan dependent and are based on the number of pooled minutes included in their plans 
service revenue also includes non recurring activation and de activation service charges 
equipment 
we sell wireless personal communications handsets and accessories that are used by our customers in connection with our wireless services 
equipment sales are a separate earnings process from other services offered by triton  and we recognize equipment sales upon delivery to the customer and reflect charges to customers for wireless handset equipment purchases 
in addition  the fair value of a handset received from a customer in a handset upgrade transaction is recorded as equipment revenue 
roaming 
we charge per minute fees to other wireless telecommunications companies for their customers use of our network facilities to place and receive wireless services 
we believe our roaming revenues will be subject to seasonality 
we expect to derive increased revenues from roaming during vacation periods  reflecting the large number of tourists visiting resorts in our coverage area 
although we expect our overall revenues to increase due to increasing roaming minutes  our per minute roaming revenue will decrease over time according to the terms of our agreements with at t wireless and other carriers 

table of contents costs and expenses our costs of services and equipment include equipment 
we purchase personal communications services handsets and accessories from third party vendors to resell to our customers for use in connection with our services 
because we subsidize the sale of handsets to encourage the use of our services  the cost of handsets is higher than the resale price to the customer 
we do not manufacture any of this equipment 
roaming fees 
we incur fees to other wireless communications companies based on airtime usage by our customers on other wireless communications networks 
transport and variable interconnect 
we incur charges associated with interconnection with other wireline and wireless carriers networks 
these fees include monthly connection costs and other fees based on minutes of use by our customers 
variable long distance 
we pay usage charges to other communications companies for long distance service provided to our customers 
these variable charges are based on our subscribers usage  applied at pre negotiated rates with the other carriers 
cell site costs 
we incur expenses for the rent of towers  network facilities  engineering operations  field technicians and related utility and maintenance charges 
recent industry data indicate that transport  interconnect  roaming and long distance charges that we currently incur will continue to decline  due principally to competitive pressures and new technologies 
other expenses include selling  general and administrative 
our selling expense includes advertising and promotional costs  commission expense for our indirect  direct and e commerce agents  and fixed charges such as store rent and retail associates salaries 
general and administrative expense includes customer care  billing  information technology  finance  accounting and legal services 
functions such as customer care  billing  finance  accounting and legal services are likely to remain centralized in order to achieve economies of scale 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation of property and equipment is computed using the straight line method  generally over three to twelve years  based upon estimated useful lives 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the useful lives of the assets or the term of the lease 
network development costs incurred to ready our network for use are capitalized 
depreciation of network development costs begins when the network equipment is ready for its intended use and is depreciated over the estimated useful life of the asset 
prior to january   our personal communications services licenses and our cellular licenses were being amortized over a period of years 
in  we adopted sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  and as a result  we ceased to amortize our fcc licenses  which we believe qualify as having an indefinite life 
non cash compensation 
as of december   we recorded million of deferred compensation associated with the issuances of our common and preferred stock to employees 
we will recognize this compensation over four to five years as the stock vests 
interest expense income 
interest expense through december  consists of interest on our credit facility  our senior subordinated discount notes due  our senior subordinated notes due and our senior subordinated notes due  net of capitalized interest 
interest income is earned primarily on our cash and cash equivalents 
other expense 
other expense primarily includes the mark to market of our interest rate swaps that do not qualify as hedges 
our ability to improve our margins will depend on our ability to manage our variable costs  including selling  general and administrative expense  costs per gross added subscriber and costs of maintaining and 
table of contents upgrading our network 
we expect our operating costs to grow as our operations expand and our customer base and call volumes increase 
over time  these expenses should represent a reduced percentage of revenues as our customer base grows 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net subscriber additions were  for the year ended december   bringing our total subscribers to  as of december   an increase of over our subscriber total as of december  the increase in subscribers was primarily due to continued demand for our digital service offerings and pricing plans 
during the year ended december   of our gross subscriber additions were post pay on a one or two year service contract 
subscriber churn was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
subscriber churn is calculated by dividing subscriber deactivations by our average subscriber base for the respective period 
we believe that our churn rate remains consistently low compared to industry average due to our high quality system performance  our commitment to quality customer service and our focused retention efforts 
average revenue per user  or arpu  was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
subscriber arpu reflects the average amount billed to subscribers based on rate plan offerings 
subscriber arpu excludes service revenue credits made to retain existing subscribers of and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these retention credits are excluded from our calculation of arpu  as these are discretionary reductions of the amount billed to a subscriber 
we have no contractual obligation to issue these credits  therefore  our arpu reflects the amount subscribers have contractually agreed to pay triton 
arpu is calculated by dividing service revenue  excluding service revenue credits made to existing subscribers  by our average subscriber base for the respective period 
we continue to focus on attracting new customers with rate plans that provide more value to the customer at a higher average customer bill 
the decrease  or  was primarily the result of a change in our rate plan mix  as many existing high arpu subscribers migrated to our new service offering  the unplan  to take advantage of the plan s unlimited minutes for calls from the subscriber s local calling area at a lower monthly cost 
total revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  service revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million or  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in service revenue was due primarily to growth of subscribers 
roaming revenue was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in roaming revenue was the result of increased roaming minutes of use resulting from the expansion of our network  the implementation of new roaming agreements with such carriers as cingular wireless and the overall growth in the wireless industry 
equipment revenue was million for the year ended december   an increase of million or  compared to million for the year ended december  equipment revenue now includes the revenue earned in the sale of a handset or handset accessories to new and existing subscribers 
in addition  equipment revenue includes the fair value of handsets received from a subscriber in a handset upgrade or exchange transaction  which was previously classified as contra expense in cost of equipment 
prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation 
the reclassification did not impact adjusted ebitda or income loss from continuing operations 
the equipment revenues increase was due primarily to an increase in the sale of phone upgrades to existing subscribers 
cost of service was million for the year ended december   an increase of million or  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was related to the higher volume of traffic on our network driven by subscriber growth and higher roaming minutes of use 
cost of service as a percentage of revenue  excluding equipment revenue  was and for 
table of contents the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease of was primarily attributable to increased leverage on fixed interconnect and cell site costs 
cost of equipment was million for the year ended december   an increase of million or  compared to million for the year ended december  cost of equipment includes the cost associated with the sale or exchange of a handset or handset accessories to new and existing subscribers 
cost of equipment now excludes the fair value of handsets received from a subscriber in a handset upgrade or exchange transaction  which was previously classified as contra expense in cost of equipment 
prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation 
the reclassification did not impact adjusted ebitda or income loss from continuing operations 
the increase in cost of equipment was driven primarily by an increase in the sale of phone upgrades to existing customers 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december  selling expenses increased by million or  primarily due to increased commissions offered to sales associates and agent distributors to promote the unplan 
general and administrative expenses increased by million or  primarily due to expansion of the number of customer care representatives to support our customer growth 
although our collection effort remained focused  bad debt expense increased from million in to million in the increase of million was the result of the growth of our subscriber base and higher involuntary churn 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue  excluding equipment revenue  was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease of is primarily attributable to increased customer care efficiency and increased leverage on other fixed costs 
beginning july   we changed our method of calculating cost per gross addition  or cpga 
cpga is calculated by dividing the sum of equipment margin for handsets sold to new subscribers equipment revenue less cost of equipment and selling and marketing expenses related to adding new subscribers by total subscribers added during the relevant period 
retail customer service expenses and the equipment margin on handsets sold to or exchanged with existing subscribers  including handset exchange and upgrade transactions  have been excluded  as these costs are incurred specifically for existing subscribers 
previously  retail customer service expenses and the additional equipment margin loss on handset exchanges with existing subscribers related to the costs to refurbish handsets received from existing subscribers were part of the calculation of cpga 
the total retail customer service expenses excluded from our calculation of cpga was million and million and the equipment margin excluded from our calculation of cpga was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the equipment margin excluded from our calculation of cpga includes million and million  respectively  of costs to refurbish handsets received from existing subscribers in a handset exchange 
the increase in equipment margin on transactions with existing subscribers is the result of the growth and aging of our subscriber base 
year ended year ended december  december  currently previously currently previously calculated calculated calculated calculated cpga non cash compensation expense was million for the year ended december   an increase of million or  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is attributable to the vesting of an increased number of restricted shares of holdings class a common stock awarded to management in prior years 
depreciation and amortization expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase of million or  compared to million for the year ended december  
table of contents the increase relates primarily to increased depreciation expense due to the growth in the depreciable asset base resulting from capital expenditures  partially offset by the effect of ceasing amortization on our fcc licenses in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
in addition  we incurred million of charges during as the result of losses on the sale of fixed assets as well as charges to accelerate depreciation on certain assets as a result of management s decision not to complete the construction of certain network infrastructure 
depreciation will continue to increase as additional portions of our network are placed into service 
interest expense was million  net of capitalized interest of million  for the year ended december  interest expense was million  net of capitalized interest of million  for the year ended december  the increase of million  or  relates primarily to increases of interest expense on our january private placement of million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes and our november private placement of million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes  offset partially by a decrease of interest expense on our bank credit facility 
the aggregate interest expense of these debt instruments increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  interest expense also increased million due to the accretion of interest on our may private placement of million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated discount notes and a decrease in capitalized interest of million for the year ended december  we had a weighted average interest rate of for the year ended december   on our average borrowings under our bank credit facility and our average obligation for the senior subordinated debt  as compared with the weighted average interest rate for the year ended december  other expense was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease of million  or  relates primarily to a decrease in the loss on the mark to market of our interest rate swaps  which was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the losses were recognized as the result of the change in fair value of our interest rate swap derivative instruments  which did not qualify as hedges 
these interest rate swaps do not qualify as hedges as the result of the repayment  in november of  of previously matched variable rate debt under our bank facility with proceeds from our note offering 
in addition  write offs of deferred financing costs decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  these write offs were a result of the early repayment of a portion of our credit facility 
interest and other income was million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease of million was due primarily to lower average interest rates on lower average cash balances 
net loss was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the net loss decrease of million resulted primarily from the items discussed above 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net subscriber additions were  for the year ended december   bringing our total subscribers to  as of december   an increase of over our subscriber total as of december  the increase in subscribers was primarily due to continued strong demand for our digital service offerings and pricing plans 
subscriber churn was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
arpu was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
subscriber arpu excludes service revenue adjustments made to retain existing subscribers of and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease  or  was primarily the result of a change in our rate plan mix  as subscribers who are new to the wireless sector typically begin service with a lower monthly access plan 

table of contents total revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  service revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million or  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in service revenue was due primarily to strong growth of subscribers 
equipment revenue was million for the year ended december   a decline of million or  compared to million for the year ended december  the equipment revenue decline was due primarily to a decrease in the average revenue per item sold  partially offset by an increase in the quantities sold 
roaming revenue was million for the year ended december   an increase of million or  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in roaming revenue was the result of increased roaming minutes of use resulting from the expansion of our network  partially offset by a contractual decrease in our service charge per minute 
cost of service was million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  compared to million for the year ended december  approximately of the increase was due to the expansion of our network 
we added approximately cell sites to our network in the remaining increase of approximately over the prior year was the result of an increase in the charges paid to connect calls on other networks  including access  interconnection and toll related charges 
these increases were due primarily to increased costs of expanding and maintaining our wireless network to support an increase in the number of subscriber and roaming minutes of use 
cost of equipment was million for the year ended december   an increase of million or  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to an increase in gross subscriber additions  partially offset by a decrease in the average cost of items sold 
selling  general and administrative costs were million for the year ended december   an increase of million or  compared to million for the year ended december  selling expenses increased approximately million  or  primarily due to increased commission and headcount related costs 
this increase resulted from a increase in gross subscriber additions in the year ended december   versus the prior year ended december  the increase was also attributable to increasing the points of distribution in our company owned retail store channel by in the general and administrative increase of approximately million  or  was primarily due to the development and growth of infrastructure and staffing related to information technology  customer care  collections  retention and other administrative functions established in conjunction with the corresponding growth in our subscriber base 
non cash compensation expense was million for the year ended december   an increase of million or  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is attributable to the vesting of an increased number of restricted shares of holdings class a common stock awarded to management in prior years 
depreciation and amortization expenses were million for the year ended december   an increase of million or compared to million for the year ended december  the increase relates primarily to increased depreciation expense due to the growth in the depreciable asset base resulting from capital expenditures 
depreciation will continue to increase as additional portions of our network were placed into service 
interest expense was million  net of capitalized interest of million  for the year ended december  interest expense was million  net of capitalized interest of million  for the year ended december  the increase of million  or relates primarily to million of interest from our million senior subordinated notes offering completed in january and million of interest from our million senior subordinated notes offering completed in november for the year ended december   we had a weighted average interest rate of on our average borrowings under our bank credit facility and our average obligation for the senior subordinated debt as compared with for the year ended december  in addition  interest expense was higher on the credit facility due to mandatory draws on the facility in 
table of contents other expense was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase of million is primarily the result of a million loss on the mark to market of interest rate swaps for the year ended december  there was no loss on the market to market of interest rate swaps in this loss was the result of paying down million of the credit facility with net proceeds from the senior subordinated notes offering  which caused certain fixed interest rate derivatives to no longer qualify as cash flow hedges in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
and sfas no 
the fair value of these non qualifying hedges on november  and subsequent changes in their fair value were recorded in the statement of operations as other expense for the year ended december  all interest rate swaps qualified as hedges in  and therefore  the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were recorded through accumulated other comprehensive income 
also attributing to the increase in other expense was a write off of approximately million of deferred financing costs in the write off was a result of the early repayment of a portion of our credit facility with the proceeds from our note offering 
interest and other income was million for the year ended december   an increase of million or  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million was due primarily to interest on higher average cash balances 
net loss was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the net loss increase of million resulted primarily from the items discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources the construction of our network and the marketing and distribution of wireless communications products and services have required  and will continue to require  substantial capital 
capital outlays have included license acquisition costs  capital expenditures for network construction  funding of operating cash flow losses and other working capital costs  debt service and financing fees and expenses 
we estimate that capital expenditures for network construction will be approximately million to million in in january  we completed a reduction in our workforce  eliminating positions  which we anticipate will result in approximately million reduction in operating costs for we believe that cash on hand and available credit facility borrowings will be sufficient to meet our projected capital requirements through  at which time we expect to become free cash flow positive 
although we estimate that these funds will be sufficient to finance our continued growth  we may have additional capital requirements  which could be substantial for future upgrades and advances in new technology

credit facility 
on september   triton pcs  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of holdings  entered into a second amended and restated credit agreement that provided for a senior secured bank facility with a group of lenders for an aggregate amount of million of borrowings 
on november   we extinguished million of the bank facility with net proceeds from the senior subordinated notes offering

equity offering 
on february   we issued and sold  shares of class a common stock in a public offering at per share and raised approximately million  net of million of costs 
adjusted ebitda 
we believe ebitda excluding non cash compensation  or adjusted ebitda  provides a meaningful measure of liquidity  providing additional information on our cash earnings from on going operations and on our ability to service our long term debt and other fixed obligations and our ability to fund our continued growth with internally generated funds 
adjusted ebitda also is considered by many financial analysts to be a meaningful indicator of an entity s ability to meet its future financial obligations 
we consider growth in adjusted ebitda to be an indicator of future profitability  especially in a capital intensive industry such as wireless telecommunications 
adjusted ebitda should not be construed as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with united states gaap 
adjusted ebitda was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
historical cash flow 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  as compared to million in cash and cash equivalents at december  net working capital was million at december  and million at december  the million of cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december  was the result of our net loss of million and million of cash used by changes in working capital and other long term assets  offset by million of depreciation and amortization  accretion of interest  non cash compensation  bad debt expense  loss in equity investment and loss on derivative instruments 
the million of cash used by investing activities during the year ending december  was primarily related to capital expenditures associated with our network build out and the acquisition of fcc licenses 
these capital expenditures were made primarily to enhance and expand our wireless network in order to increase capacity and to satisfy subscriber needs and competitive requirements 
we will continue to upgrade our network capacity and service quality to support our anticipated subscriber growth 
the million provided by financing activities during the year ended december  relates primarily to our million draw against our credit facility partially offset by million of credit facility repayments 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  as compared to million in cash and cash equivalents at december  net working capital deficit was million at december  and million at december  the million of cash used in operating activities during the year ended december  was the result of our net loss of million and million of cash used in changes in working capital and other long term assets and offset by million of depreciation and amortization  accretion of interest  non cash compensation  bad debt expense  loss in equity investment and loss on derivative instruments 
the million of cash used by investing activities during the year ending december  was related primarily to capital expenditures associated with our network build out and advances to lafayette 
these capital expenditures 
table of contents were made primarily to enhance and expand our wireless network in order to increase capacity and to satisfy subscriber needs and competitive requirements 
we will continue to upgrade our network capacity and service quality to support our anticipated subscriber growth 
the million provided by financing activities during the year ended december  relates primarily to our million draw against our credit facility  million of net proceeds from the issuances of senior subordinated notes and million of net proceeds from our equity offering  partially offset by million of credit facility repayments 
reconciliation of non gaap financial measures we utilize certain financial measures that are not calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap  to assess our financial performance 
a non gaap financial measure is defined as a numerical measure of a company s financial performance that excludes amounts  or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts  that are included in the comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap in the statement of income or statement of cash flows  or ii includes amounts  or is subject to adjustments that have the effect of including amounts  that are excluded from the comparable measure so calculated and presented 
the discussion of each non gaap financial measure we use in this report appear above under adjusted ebitda and results of operations 
a brief description of the calculation of each measure is included where the particular measure is first discussed 
the following tables reconcile our non gaap financial measures with our financial statements presented in accordance with gaap 
year ended december  adjusted ebitda net cash provided by used in operating activities change in operating assets and liabilities change in deferred income taxes interest expense accretion of interest interest and other income bad debt expense other expense income tax expense benefit adjusted ebitda the table above reconciles adjusted ebitda with the most directly comparable gaap measure of liquidity  cash provided by used in operating activities 
we believe adjusted ebitda provides a meaningful measure of liquidity  providing additional information on our cash earnings from on going operations and on our ability to service our long term debt and other fixed obligations and our ability to fund continued growth with internally generated funds 
adjusted ebitda also is considered by many financial analysts to be a meaningful indicator of an entity s ability to meet its future financial obligations

table of contents year ended december  average revenue per user arpu service revenue subscriber retention credits adjusted service revenue average subscribers arpu we believe arpu  which calculates the average service revenue generated by an individual subscriber  is a useful measure to assist in forecasting our future service revenue 
in addition  it provides a gauge to compare our service revenue to that of other wireless communication providers 
subscriber retention credits are service revenue credits made to retain existing subscribers 
these retention credits are excluded from our calculation of arpu  as these are discretionary reductions of the amount billed to a subscriber 
we have no contractual obligation to issue these credits  therefore  our arpu reflects the amount subscribers have contractually agreed to pay triton

table of contents relationship with lafayette communications company llc we hold a interest in lafayette  an entrepreneur under fcc guidelines 
during  lafayette held fcc licenses  covering a population of approximately million people 
on september   we acquired certain fcc licenses from lafayette in markets covering a population of approximately million people in areas of georgia  tennessee and virginia  for an aggregate fair value of million 
this acquisition was consummated to meet the spectrum needs of our current network overlay of gsm gprs technology 
we have entered into agreements with lafayette to acquire additional licenses from lafayette for an aggregate fair value of million 
we expect these acquisitions to be consummated in the second quarter of as of december   we have funded approximately million of senior loans to lafayette to finance the acquisition of licenses 
the carrying value of these loans has been adjusted for any losses in excess of our initial investment 
in connection with the loans  lafayette has and will guarantee our obligations under our credit facility  and such senior loans are and will be pledged to the lenders under our credit facility 
because we do not control lafayette  we are accounting for our investment under the equity method 
ordinarily  as the investor  we would record our proportionate share of lafayette s losses in our income statement 
however  triton has committed to provide further financial support to lafayette in order to preserve its business relationship 
therefore  even in the absence of a legally binding obligation  we are now recognizing of lafayette s losses  which arise primarily from interest costs related to an assumed note payable to the fcc 
in accordance with eitf  accounting by an equity method investor for investee losses when the investor has loans to and investments in other securities of the investee  when the carrying amount of an investment has been reduced to zero  the investor should continue to report its share of the equity method losses in its statement of operations as an adjustment to the adjusted basis of the loans receivable 
as of december   we had written our initial investment in lafayette down to zero and had reduced its carrying value of the approximate million loan receivable from lafayette  so as to reflect of lafayette s cumulative loss of approximately million

new accounting pronouncements in june of  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets 
sfas no 
requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred and capitalize that amount as part of the book value of the long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement 
this statement is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after june  we have certain legal obligations  principally related to our leased cell site properties  which fall within the scope of sfas no 
these legal obligations include obligations to remediate leased property on which cell sites are located 
in conjunction with the adoption of sfas no 
effective january   we did not record asset retirement obligations for network infrastructure assets subject to the provisions of this statement as the 
table of contents fair value of the obligations could not reasonably be estimated 
we believe that uncertainty as to the eventual settlement of legal obligations exists due to trends in the wireless communications industry  including the rapid growth in minutes of use on wireless networks  increasing subscriber penetration and deployment of advanced wireless data technologies such as gsm gprs 
therefore  these factors increase the probability that third parties would not contractually enforce their remediation rights related to the sites 
based on the combination of these industry trends and our limited experience in removing sites  it is not probable that any sites will be removed in the foreseeable future and require remediation 
therefore  sufficient information to estimate a range of potential settlement dates is not available 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we will not recognize a liability until such information becomes known 
in april  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of sfas statement no 
and technical corrections as of april 
sfas no 
primarily addresses i the income statement classification of gains or losses from the extinguishment of debt as ordinary or extraordinary and ii the treatment of certain lease modifications with sale leaseback accounting when they have an economic effect similar to a sale leaseback agreement 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years beginning after may  any gain or loss on extinguishment of debt that was classified as an extraordinary item in prior periods presented that does not meet the criteria in accounting principles board opinion no 
for classification as an extraordinary item shall be reclassified 
early application of the provisions of this statement related to the rescission of sfas no 
is encouraged 
as such  we have reclassified an extraordinary loss on the extinguishment of debt in to other expense 
we do not believe further implementation of this statement will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
nullifies eitf liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity 
the principle difference between sfas no 
and eitf relates to sfas no 
s requirements for recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under eitf  a liability for an exit cost as generally defined in eitf was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
a fundamental conclusion reached by the fasb in this statement is that an entity s commitment to a plan  by itself  does not create an obligation that meets the definition of a liability 
therefore  this statement eliminates the definition and requirements for recognition of exit costs in eitf this statement also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we will apply this statement to the accounting for all prospective exit or disposal activities 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
primarily i provides an alternative method of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and ii requires prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for the fiscal years beginning after december  we will disclose our method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results in future financial statements 
in february  the emerging issues task force issued eitf revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf primarily addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
specifically  it addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting 
in applying eitf  separate contracts with the same entity or related parties that are entered into at or near the same time are presumed to have been negotiated as a package and should  
table of contents therefore  be evaluated as a single arrangement in considering whether there are one or more units of accounting 
that presumption may be overcome if there is sufficient evidence to the contrary 
eitf also addresses how arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting in the arrangement 
the provisions of eitf are effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the impact this statement will have on our financial position or results of operations 
in february  the emerging issues task force issued eitf accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor 
issue of eitf primarily addresses the circumstances under which cash consideration received from a vendor by a reseller should be considered a an adjustment of the prices of the vendor s products or services and  therefore  characterized as a reduction of cost of sales when recognized in the reseller s income statement  b an adjustment to a cost incurred by the reseller and  therefore  characterized as a reduction of that cost when recognized in the reseller s income statement  or c a payment for assets or services delivered to the vendor and  therefore  characterized as revenue when recognized in the reseller s income 
the provisions of issue of eitf are effective for fiscal periods beginning after december  issue of eitf addresses vendors offering a customer a rebate or refund of a specified amount of cash consideration that is payable only if the customer completes a specified cumulative level of purchases or remains a customer for a specified time period  when the customer should recognize the rebate and how the customer should measure the amount of the offer 
the provisions of issue of eitf are effective for all arrangements entered into after november  we do not believe that this statement will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in january  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  or fin fin requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
fin also requires disclosures about variable interest entities that a company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  the consolidation requirements apply to existing entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  certain of the disclosure requirements apply in all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established 
we are currently evaluating the impact of fin on our financial statements and related disclosures but do not believe that this statement will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our operations 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are highly leveraged and  as a result  our cash flows and earnings are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates 
our debt obligations are us dollar denominated 
our market risk  therefore  is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates 
as of december   our debt can be categorized as follows fixed interest rates senior subordinated notes subject to interest rate fluctuations bank credit facility our interest rate risk management program focuses on minimizing exposure to interest rate movements  setting an optimal mixture of floating and fixed rate debt and minimizing liquidity risk 
to the extent possible  we manage interest rate exposure and the floating to fixed ratio through our borrowings  but sometimes we may use interest rate swaps to adjust our risk profile 
we selectively enter into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate exposure only 
however  due to repayments under our credit facility  many of our interest rates swaps no longer qualify as cash flow hedges 
we utilize interest rate swaps to hedge against the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our bank credit facility 
swap counter parties are major commercial banks 
through december   we had entered into interest rate swap transactions having an aggregate non amortizing notional amount of million 
under these interest rate swap contracts  we agree to pay an amount equal to a specified fixed rate of interest times a notional principal amount and receive in turn an amount equal to a specified variable rate of interest times the same notional amount 
the notional amounts of the contracts are not exchanged 
net interest positions are settled quarterly 
information  as of december   for the interest rate swaps is as follows terms notional amount fair value swaps acting as hedges swaps not acting as hedges the swaps commencing on april   which have an aggregate notional amount of million  can be terminated at the banks option on april  the swaps commencing on april   which have an aggregate notional amount of million  can be terminated at the banks option on april  and quarterly thereafter 

table of contents the variable rate is capped at for the interest rate swaps commencing on june  through august  these swaps have an aggregate notional amount of million 
if market swap rates rise over the remaining term of these swaps  as expected  we should realize other income of approximately million for each basis point increase in rates 
if rates were to decline  we would realize other expense of approximately million for each basis point decrease in rates 
our cash and cash equivalents consist of short term assets having initial maturities of three months or less 
while these investments are subject to a degree of interest rate risk  it is not considered to be material relative to our overall investment income position
