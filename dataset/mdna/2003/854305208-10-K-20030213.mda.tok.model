the following table sets forth the company s contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments at december  payment due or commitment expiration less than over total year years years years contractual cash obligations long term debt      operating leases  total contractual cash obligations      other commercial commitments letters of credit   critical accounting policies management has chosen accounting policies that are necessary to accurately and fairly report the company s operational and financial position 
below are the critical accounting policies that involve the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful receivables for estimated losses resulting from the inability of trade customers to make required payments 
the company provides an allowance for specific customer accounts where collection is doubtful and also provides a general allowance for other accounts based on historical collection and write off experience 
judgment is critical because some customers have experienced financial difficulties 
as the financial condition of these customers change  the level of such allowances will be reevaluated 
inventory valuation inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost for all inventories is determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
the company evaluates its inventory to determine excess or slow moving items based on current order activity and projections of future demand 
for those items identified  the company estimates its market value or net sales value based on current trends 
an allowance is created for those items having a net sales value less than cost 
this process recognizes projected inventory losses when they become evident rather than at the time they are sold 
long lived assets property and intangible assets are reviewed for possible impairment when events indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
assumptions and estimates used in the evaluation of impairment may affect the carrying value of long lived assets  which could result in impairment charges in future periods 
depreciation and amortization policies reflect judgments on the estimated useful lives of assets 
tax contingencies tax contingencies are recorded to address potential exposures involving tax positions the company has taken that could be challenged by taxing authorities 
these potential exposures result from the varying applications of statutes  rules  regulations and interpretations 
the company s estimate of the value of its tax contingencies contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions 
the ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than the amount that the company has accrued 
pension costs the company s pension expense is developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions  including discount rates and expected return on plan assets  which are usually updated on an annual basis at the beginning of each year 
the company is required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in making these assumptions 
changes in pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions 
the key assumptions used in developing net pension costs were a discount rate and a expected return on plan assets 
these were consistent with the prior year assumptions except that the discount rate was reduced by basis points due to current market conditions 
compared with the prior year  net pension cost increased  excluding the impact of settlement expense 
net pension cost is projected to increase approximately  in  excluding the impact of settlement expense  primarily as a result of a reduction in discount rate from in to in  a reduction in expected return on plan assets from in to in and increased amortization of unrecognized loss 
in establishing its expected return on plan assets assumption  the company reviews asset allocation considering plan maturity and develops return assumptions based on different asset classes adjusting for plan operating expenses 
actual asset over under performance compared to expected returns will respectively decrease increase unrecognized loss 
the change in the unrecognized loss will change amortization cost in upcoming periods 
a one percentage point change in the expected return assumption in the current year would have resulted in a change in pension expense of approximately  the company does not have transactions or relationships with special purpose entities  and the company does not have any off balance sheet financing other than normal operating leases primarily for showroom and certain technology equipment
