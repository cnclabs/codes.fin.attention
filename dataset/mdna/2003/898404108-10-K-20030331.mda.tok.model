item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
nature of business the company is a non taxed financial services and real estate company dedicated to acquiring  managing  and financing branded chain restaurant properties such as burger king  arby s  chili s  pizza hut and other service retail properties 
the company derives its revenue primarily from the leasing of its properties restaurants and service stations to operators on a triple net basis 
triple net leases typically require the tenants to be responsible for property operating costs  including property taxes  insurance  maintenance  and in most cases  the ground rents where applicable 
approximately of the company s leases provide for base rent plus a percentage of the tenant s sales in excess of a contractual threshold 
as a result  portions of the company s revenues are a function of the number of properties in operation and their level of tenant s sales 
tenant s sales at individual properties are influenced by local market conditions  the efforts of specific operators  marketing  new product programs  support of the franchisor and the general state of the economy 
in some cases  the company s triple net leases are guaranteed by third parties such as burger king corporation 
therefore  the company s revenue is dependent to a certain degree on the financial health of these third party guarantors 
another significant source of revenue for the company is its retail operations which began in the company operates various service stations  restaurants and car washes in order to transition the operations of these properties from one tenant to another 
company strategies growth strategy the company seeks to maximize sustainable growth in funds from operations ffo through effective management  operation and acquisition of restaurant properties 
we believe we can achieve this goal of increasing ffo per share by acquiring high quality restaurant properties at attractive returns  re leasing space at increased rental rates as leases expire and when market conditions warrant  and actively managing our portfolio  including periodically re evaluating all assets for strategic disposition or repositioning 
strategic direction management has determined that  in order to optimize the company s financial results  the focus of operations should be on the ownership of restaurant properties 
the objective is for the company to become the premier restaurant property reit 
the intention is to achieve this objective through an assertive approach to asset management and a creative acquisition strategy targeting both small groups of properties and consolidated property portfolios 
the company s asset management capabilities are evidenced by the fact that the lease renewal rate has historically been approximately and in the net book value of properties disposed of totaled approximately  asset management s capabilities have been expanded and improved through the establishment of our operating subsidiary  fsi  which focuses exclusively on operating properties that we have reacquired from lessees  in order to provide an orderly transition from one tenant to another 
our acquisition strategy is dual faceted with emphasis being placed both on single properties or small portfolio acquisitions and on merchant banking opportunities pursuant to which large consolidated portfolios or entire businesses with high concentrations of real estate are acquired and then broken into parts with the real estate being retained and the operations being leased to independent third parties 
the company intends to maintain brand diversity  with no single restaurant brand exceeding of the portfolio 
the company s proven ability to assist property owners in the refinancing of their assets  meaning the transition from company ownership of the restaurant operations to franchisee ownership  makes the company an attractive real estate buyer 
in determining to refocus business operations on the core competency of restaurant property  management is taking steps to reduce the company s ownership of service stations and convenience stores 
the goal is to have the number of gas stations owned by the company reduced to less than of the properties 
this goal will be achieved through the orderly disposition of a number of these properties in the near future  as market conditions allow 
additionally  other than the occasional acquisition of notes from captain d s  which are used by the company as acquisition currency  the company has ceased actively pursuing investments in the securities of third party property owners 
acquisition strategy the company s primary acquisition strategy is to identify and acquire high quality restaurant properties 
returns on acquisitions have been maximized as a result of the following company strengths expertise in evaluating and capitalizing on the real estate needs of chain restaurant tenants  the ability to identify and acquire financially attractive restaurant properties operated by major national and regional restaurant brands  and expertise in identifying and evaluating restaurant operators 
extensive personal and business relationships that management has developed over time within the real estate and chain restaurant industries are beneficial in identifying prospective acquisition opportunities and in consummating favorable acquisitions prior to the active marketing of the subject properties 
critical evaluation of prospective property acquisitions is an essential component of the company s acquisition strategy 
when evaluating acquisition opportunities  management assesses a full range of matters relating to the properties  including the quality of the tenant  the condition and capacity of building infrastructure  the remaining lease term and the strength of the brand affiliation 
additionally  the company s access to capital provides a competitive advantage over other potential property acquirors whose offers may be contingent upon obtaining the requisite financing 
to achieve a predictable return while maintaining a low risk profile  the following acquisition criteria have been developed invest in major restaurant brands 
the company intends to continue to acquire properties operated by competent  financially stable multi unit restaurant operators  some of which are affiliated with major national and regional brands such as burger king  arby s  dairy queen  hardee s  chili s  pizza hut  schlotzsky s  grandy s  taco cabana  shoney s and captain d s 
management believes that successful restaurants operated under these types of brands will continue to offer stable  consistent income to the company with reduced risk of default or non renewal of the lease and franchise agreement 
company strategy will continue to focus primarily on the acquisition of existing chain restaurant properties that have a history of profitable operations with a remaining term on the current lease of at least years 
management believes that acquiring established restaurant properties provides a higher risk adjusted rate of return than acquiring newly constructed restaurants 
acquire properties subject to long term leases 
the company has historically acquired  and intends to continue to acquire  properties subject to existing long term leases 
the average remaining lease term for the properties as of december  was over years 
management believes that by having long term leases in place  the company avoids the risks associated with trying to lease the property  including uncertainty as to lease rate and tenant continuity 
operating strategy management has endeavored to achieve a consistent return by employing the strategies described above while at the same time minimizing loss risk 
the significant risk in the chain restaurant property business falls into two categories default losses and or non renewal of leases with accompanying declines in rent 
over the three years ended december   the company has made significant improvements in rent collections and has maintained a lease renewal rate of approximately 
these achievements are the result of the following operating strategies which are designed to enhance the predictability and sustainability of company cash flow rent payment protection 
the company is protected from loss of rent payment by employing strict underwriting standards  such as rent coverage ratio analysis  and including terms and conditions in our leases which discourage non payment  such as master leases covering multi unit operations  cross default provisions on other properties  non access to restaurant equipment and letters of credit and or personal guaranty requirements 
lease renewal 
the location of a restaurant is a critical factor in a restaurant s success 
as a result  the company s tenants  in most cases  would experience a loss in the profitability of a store and incur difficulty and cost in moving the store in the event of non renewal of the lease 
as a result  the company believes renewal of the lease  on terms equal to or better than the existing terms  is more likely to occur than the tenant vacating the space 
historically  the company s lease renewal rate has been approximately 
in addition  an early lease renewal program has been implemented pursuant to which the company offers remodeling financing to tenants in consideration for renewing and restructuring existing leases 
this program helps to mitigate the risk of non renewals of leases and will enable the company  where needed  to restructure the leases to require the tenant to be responsible for all costs associated with operating the property 
the company aggressively pursues lease renewals to take advantage of this need by tenants for stability and continuity 
diversification 
the company s income stream is further protected through the diversification of properties by location  brand affiliation and the large number of tenants leasing the properties 
the company s properties are diversified geographically in states  with no state  except texas  accounting for a concentration of greater than 
the geographic diversity provides the company with protection from downturns in local and regional economies 
since the inception of the company in its current state in april  the company has significantly expanded the number of brand affiliations in its properties 
of the properties net of dispositions acquired since april  only were burger king restaurants and the balance were affiliated with other national and regional chain restaurants 
additionally  at december   no single tenant accounted for more than of the company s real estate revenues 
as a result  the company is not materially dependent on any one operator or any small group of operators 
while the company has no binding agreement to purchase properties from shoney s  management believes that the company can leverage its participation in the recent privatization transaction with shoney s  inc to purchase shoney s and captain d s properties and thereby add to its broad diversification 
in this regard  as of december   the company had purchased properties from shoney s  consisting of shoney s properties and captain d s properties 
asset management 
each restaurant operated on one of the company s properties is periodically analyzed to identify opportunities to improve its return 
such opportunities may include purchasing property adjacent to the current property  working with existing tenants to improve the sales and performance of their stores  and in some cases providing remodeling financing toward that end 
major developments investments on january   lone star us acquisitions llc an affiliate of the lone star holders  the op  lsf acquisition  llc and shoney s inc entered into an agreement and plan of merger pursuant to which lsf acquisition  llc would merge into shoney s  with shoney s being the surviving entity

dispositions during  the company sold or disposed of properties for a net gain of  which is included in income from discontinued operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management of the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on a regular basis  the company evaluates these estimates  including asset impairment and provision for doubtful accounts 
these estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition the company derives its real estate revenues primarily from the leasing of its properties to operators primarily restaurants on a triple net basis 
triple net leases typically require the tenants to be responsible for property operating costs  including property taxes  insurance  maintenance and  in most cases  the ground rents where applicable 
accordingly  the accompanying consolidated financial statements do not reflect property taxes and insurance costs or reimbursement revenues where the tenant has legally assumed responsibility for these liabilities 
as the company remains legally responsible for ground rents under its ground leases and receives payment from its tenants for these costs  amounts reimbursed from tenants for ground rents are recorded as rent revenue 
the company has recorded rent revenues associated with ground lease reimbursements of   and  of which   and  is reflected in income loss from discontinued operations for the years ended december   and  respectively 
rent revenues and expenses under operating leases are recognized on a straight line basis  unless significant collection problems occur with the lessee  at which time rents are recorded on a cash basis 
percent rent is recognized as revenue after the related lease sales targets are achieved 
the company derives its retail revenues from the sale of gasoline  car washes  convenience store merchandise  and food sales at restaurants operated by the company 
revenue is recognized as it is received 
asset impairment the company s management routinely reviews its investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
indicators of possible impairment include default of lease terms  non payment or late payment of rents  decreases in tenant s sales levels and general declines in the success of the operating brand names of its tenants 
when these indicators are present  the company reviews the circumstances of the indicator and  if an impairment is necessary because the estimated undiscounted cash flows are less than the net carrying amount of the asset  secures an estimate of fair market value of the property affected 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company regularly analyzes its receivables on an individual basis for uncollectibility and the related reserves are analyzed for adequacy 
accounts receivable balances that are  or more and have been outstanding for days or more are reviewed 
all balances due from these tenants are reviewed and evaluated  including rent receivables  notes receivable  mortgage loans receivable  interest receivable and deferred rent receivables all information regarding the creditworthiness of the tenants and debtors are reviewed  including bankruptcy filings and financial statements 
company policy is to review at least of the accounts receivable that are over days past due 
once a reserve has been established for a tenant or debtor  the company maintains that reserve until there has been a proven history of cash payment performance 
after at least two months of cash payments  the circumstances pertaining to the tenant or debtor is reevaluated to estimate the ultimate collectibility of the receivable 
receivables are written off only upon written approval by a member of the executive management of the company 
each note and mortgage loan receivable with amounts past due for over months or which are otherwise problematic or of concern due to other factors are included in the analysis 
the company evaluates its notes and mortgage loans receivables in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
a note or mortgage is impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
when a loan is impaired  the impairment is measured based on the excess of the recorded investment in the loan over either the present value of expected future cash flows including costs to sell  if applicable discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent or if foreclosure is probable 
a loan is collateral dependent if the repayment of the loan is expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral 
impairments are recognized by creating a valuation allowance with a corresponding charge to provision for doubtful accounts or by adjusting an existing valuation allowance for the impaired loan with a corresponding charge or credit to provisions for doubtful accounts 
subsequent to the initial measurement of impairment  if there is a significant change in the amount or timing of an impaired loan s expected future cash flows or the fair value of the collateral  or if actual cash flows are significantly different from the cash flows previously projected  the company recalculates the impairment and adjusts the valuation allowance

in december  the guarantor of the lyons notes  ich corporation ich and its wholly owned subsidiary  sybra  inc sybra began the process of emerging from chapter bankruptcy 
as part of their reorganization  triarc companies inc triarc purchased sybra from ich 
triarc assumed all of the company s sybra leases arby s and is now the company s largest tenant 
the bankruptcy court  in accepting triarc s purchase of sybra  required that the proceeds from the purchase be placed in escrow with the court for the benefit of the unsecured creditors 
these funds are currently in escrow and the company expects to receive its share in although the exact amount of recoverability on the lyons notes is uncertain  the company expects to recover almost all of the original principal balance because the fair value of the collateral has become more certain

funds from operations ffo while the company believes that it computes ffo in accordance with the standards established by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit in their national policy bulletins dated november   april  and april   the company s calculation may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other equity reits  and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other reits 
the company s ffo is computed as net income loss available to common stockholders computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization  gains or losses from sales of property  impairment of long lived assets  extraordinary items and income loss allocable to minority interest holders 
the company believes ffo is helpful to investors as a measure of the performance of an equity reit because  along with the company s statements of financial condition  results of operations and cash flows  it provides investors with an understanding of the ability of the company to incur and service debt and make capital expenditures 
in evaluating ffo and the trends it depicts  investors should consider the major factors affecting ffo 
growth in ffo will result from increases in revenue or decreases in related operating expenses 
conversely  ffo will decline if revenues decline or related operating expenses increase 
ffo does not represent amounts available for management s discretionary use because of needed capital replacement or expansion  debt service obligation  or other commitments and uncertainties 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  as an indication of the company s financial performance  to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united state of america or as a measure of the company s liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the company s cash needs  including its ability to make distributions 
the following table sets forth ffo for the years ended december   and years ended december  amounts in thousands net income loss allocable to common stockholders   real estate depreciation and amortization    gain on sale of properties    impairment of long lived assets    extraordinary loss adjustments allocable to minority interest  ffo basic    income loss allocable to minority interest adjustments allocable to minority interest ffo diluted    inflation some of the company s leases are subject to adjustments for increases in the consumer price index  which reduces the risk to the company of the adverse effects of inflation 
additionally  to the extent inflation increases tenant s sales volume  percentage rents may tend to offset the effects of inflation on the company 
because triple net leases also require the restaurant operator to pay for some or all operating expenses  property taxes  property repair and maintenance costs including environmental costs and insurance  some or all of the inflationary impact of these expenses will be borne by the property operator and not by the company 
inflation does impact the company through the purchase of gasoline by the retail segment 
seasonality fast food restaurant operations historically have been seasonal in nature  reflecting higher unit sales during the second and third quarters due to warmer weather and increased leisure travel 
this seasonality can be expected to cause fluctuations in the company s quarterly revenue to the extent it recognizes percentage rent
