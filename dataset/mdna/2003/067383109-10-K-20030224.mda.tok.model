item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and of financial conditions continued critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements requires the company s management to make estimates and assumptions that effect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the sec recently issued guidance for critical accounting policies 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
the following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the company s accounting policies 
the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in the company s notes to consolidated financial statements 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
the critical accounting policies described below are areas in which management s judgment in selecting an available alternative would produce a materially different result 
revenue recognition the company recognizes product revenue  net of discounts and rebates when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  title and risk of loss has transferred  the buyer s price is fixed or determinable  contractual obligations have been satisfied and collectibility is reasonably assured 
these requirements are met and sales and related cost of sales are recognized for the majority of the company s products upon shipment 
in the case of consignment inventories  revenues and associated costs are recognized upon the notification of usage by the customer 
a small percentage of the company s products require installation and in those cases revenues and related costs are recognized when installation is complete 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
for most domestic divisions cost is determined using the last in first out lifo method 
for all other inventories cost is determined using the first in first out fifo method 
due to changing technologies and cost containment the difference between the inventory valuation under the lifo method and the fifo method is not significant 
restructuring cost estimates as a result of business acquisitions or dispositions or as a result of organizational realignment or rationalization  the company may develop formal plans to exit certain activities  involuntarily terminate employees  terminate leases  writedown assets or close duplicative facilities 
currently  these costs and expenses are estimated in accordance with emerging issues task force no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity eitf and staff accounting bulletin no 
 restructuring and impairment charges 
as additional information becomes available in future periods  the company may revise the estimated restructuring accrual based on the updated information 
the company does not anticipate that material revisions will be necessary  however  if such revisions in estimates are necessary the change could have a material impact on the company s results of operations in the period of the cha nge 
in july  the fasb issued fas fas reconsiders all of the guidance contained in eitf this pronouncement requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
fas is effective item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and of financial conditions continued for the company as of january  fas will not impact the accounting for any restructuring plan approved or announced to date  however  the pronouncement will impact the accounting for any future exit or disposal activities approved on or after january  legal reserve estimates the company is at times involved in legal actions  the outcomes of which are not within the company s complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time 
in some cases  the claimants seek damages  as well as other relief  which  if granted  could require significant expenditures 
a liability is recorded in the company s consolidated financial statements for these actions when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
if the loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated  a liability is not recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
tax estimates the company operates in multiple tax jurisdictions both in the united states and internationally 
accordingly  the determination of the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions requires the company to make estimates and assumptions 
the company is subject to local tax authority audits including review and possible adjustment to revenue and expense allocations made to such local tax jurisdictions 
these audits can take place over extended periods and can result in an increase to the company s tax liability for specific tax jurisdictions 
allowance for doubtful accounts  customer rebates and inventory writedowns management makes estimates of the uncollectibility of the company s accounts receivable  amounts that are rebated to specific customers in accordance with contractual requirements and inventory adjustments to reflect inventory valuation at the lower of cost or market 
in estimating the reserves necessary for the allowance for doubtful accounts  management considers historical bad debt trends  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends 
the company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated amounts that are uncollectibles from customers 
in estimating the allowance for customer rebates  management considers the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the customer s rebate claim  customer specific trend analysis and contractual commitments including the stated rebate rate 
the company establishes an allowance for customer rebates and reduces sales fo r such rebate amounts 
in estimating the allowance for inventory writedowns  management considers product obsolescence  quantity on hand  future demand for the product and other market related conditions 
the company records an allowance for inventory writedowns when such conditions cause the inventory market value to be below carrying value 
the company records such adjustments to cost of sales in the period the condition exists 
it is possible that the underlying factors discussed above for the allowance for doubtful accounts  customer rebates and inventory writedowns could change 
depending on the extent and nature of the change to the underlying factors  the impact to the company s financial position and results of operations could be material in the period of change 
item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and of financial conditions continued pension plans the company sponsors pension plans covering substantially all domestic employees and certain foreign employees who meet eligibility requirements 
several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the company  within certain guidelines 
in addition  the company s actuarial consultants also use subjective factors  such as withdrawal and mortality rates to estimate these factors 
the actuarial assumptions used by the company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of the participants 
these differences may have a significant effect on the amount of pension expense recorded by the company

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk bard operates on a global basis and therefore is subject to the exposures that arise from foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
the company manages these exposures using operational and economic hedges as well as derivative financial instruments 
the company s foreign currency exposures may change over time as changes occur in the company s international operations 
the company s objective in managing its exposures to foreign currency fluctuations is to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility associated with assets  liabilities  net investments and probable commitments denominated in foreign currencies 
in order to reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  the company has hedged a substantial portion of its expected foreign currency denominated cash flow from operations 
the instruments that the company uses for hedging are readily marketable  traded forward contracts and options with financial institutions 
bard s risk management policy prohibits entering into financial instrum ents for speculative purposes 
the company expects that the changes in fair value of such contracts will have a high correlation to the price changes in the related hedged cash flow 
the company does not expect that the risk of transaction gains or losses from changes in the fair value of its foreign exchange position will be material because most transactions will occur in either the functional currency or in a currency that has a high correlation to the functional currency 
the principal currencies the company hedges are the euro  the peso and the yen 
any gains and losses on these hedge contracts are expected to offset changes in the value of the related exposure 
the company enters into foreign currency transactions only to the extent that foreign currency exposure exists 
monetary assets of the company held in foreign currencies have relatively short maturities and are denominated in currencies that have not experienced wide  short term fluctuations in their equivalent united states dollar values 
in december  the company issued million of notes due these notes may be redeemed at the option of the note holders on december   at a redemption price equal to the principal amount 
assuming maturity  the market value of these notes was approximately million at december
