overview we are a leading provider of human capital management hcm services 
we offer a combination of high tech and high touch services  providing customers with the ability to manage their complete recruiting  retention and outplacement needs on a single workstream platform 
the past two fiscal years have resulted in significant changes in our business 
during the first six months of fiscal we completed the acquisition of icarian  purecarbon and xylo 
during the first six months of fiscal  we completed the acquisition of paula allen holdings  omnipartners  figurejobs 
com  rezlogic  resumexpress and tech engine 
subsequent to the acquisitions  we have concentrated on integrating the acquired entities and expanding the reach of the existing business 
these acquisitions have enabled us to increase our service offerings and revenue streams 
due to the substantive change these acquisitions have made to our business  this management s discussion and analysis includes comparisons of pro forma results of operations for fiscal and fiscal these pro forma results assume that the above acquisitions had been completed as at june  and therefore compare revenues and expenses of us and all our subsidiaries for both fiscal years 
critical accounting policies our most critical accounting policies relate to the assessment of goodwill impairment  impairments in intangible assets and the valuation of net deferred tax assets 
management applies judgment to value these assets 
changes in assumptions used would impact our financial results 
goodwill is assessed for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if circumstances warrant 
we assess goodwill related to reporting units for impairment  and write down the carrying amount of goodwill as required 
we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit by preparing a discounted cash flow model  using a discount rate 
the model is prepared by projecting results for five years making different assumptions for each business unit 
we assumed that the economy would begin to improve starting in fiscal  revenue growth rates would range from to  gross profit would remain consistent with current trends  and operating expense would be reduced in the first year due to rent reductions and would grow to in the latter years 
an impairment charge is recorded if the implied fair value of goodwill of a reporting unit is less than the book value of goodwill for that unit 
changes in the discount rate used  or in other assumptions in the model  would result in wide fluctuations in the value of goodwill that is supported 
any such changes may result in additional impairment write downs 
we value intangible assets  such as a customer base acquired in an acquisition  based on estimated future income applying historical customer retention rates 
if the customer base acquired discontinues using our service earlier than historical experience  we may be required to record an impairment of intangible assets 
changes in circumstances impacting other assumptions used to value intangible assets could also lead to future impairments 
we apply significant judgment in recording net deferred tax assets  which result from the loss carry forwards of companies that we acquire 
the recording of deferred tax assets requires estimates of future profits from the acquired company to be forecast 
actual results may differ from amounts estimated

following completion of the fiscal and fiscal acquisitions  we focused on integrating the acquired entities and expanding the reach of the existing businesses 
we have also made efforts to reduce costs by consolidating operations  resulting in staff reductions of redundant positions and related overhead and reducing research and development expenditures 
certain actions taken to reduce costs have also caused reductions in revenue 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues consolidated revenues were  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal  an increase of  or 
fiscal revenues from companies we acquired during fiscal represented  for the year ended may  revenues other than from companies we acquired in fiscal declined to  from  in fiscal mainly due to lower career transition service revenues lower from fiscal caused by our consolidation of office locations and lower enterprise recruitment services revenues lower from fiscal 
we believe that enterprise recruitment services revenues other than those resulting from acquisitions decreased in fiscal as a result of the continued softness in the economy which we believe has led to fewer companies hiring additional staff 
career transition services revenues for fiscal were  compared to  for fiscal the major reason for the decline in career transition services revenues was due to the closure of two office locations in the fourth quarter of fiscal and four office locations in the first six months of fiscal these closures are a result of our plan to consolidate sales locations and develop larger centers in fewer locations in order to leverage management costs and improve internal controls 
enterprise recruiting services revenues for fiscal were  compared to  for fiscal the increase in revenues was primarily due to the acquisition of icarian  purecarbon  and xylo in fiscal this increase was partially offset by a decline in sales in recruiting research and some sectors of recruiting software which we believe is due to the weak economy 
pro forma revenues for fiscal were  compared to  for fiscal pro forma revenues include the revenues of all acquired companies for the full reporting periods  instead of from their acquisition dates 
the decline in pro forma revenues is primarily due to the impact of clients that icarian lost subsequent to november  but prior to being acquired by us 
the majority of these clients produced little or no profit margins due to extensive customer service needs 
additionally  pro forma revenues declined as a result of the closure of the career transition services offices 
we also believe that the economic downturn has continued to negatively impact our recruiting research and software services 
we believe that the acquisitions we made in fiscal and fiscal allow us to deliver a broader range of recruiting and outplacement products and services through our offices across north america 
management believes that the acquisitions will have a significant impact on future revenues 
cost of revenues cost of revenues for fiscal were  compared to  for fiscal  an increase of  or 
cost of revenues includes the cost of network operations  client support and charges related to third party services 
career transition services cost of revenues accounted for  and enterprise recruiting services cost of revenues accounted for  of the total cost of revenues for fiscal cost of revenues in the enterprise recruiting services segment increased  from fiscal the acquisitions done in fiscal contributed  to this increase which was partially offset by reduced costs as a result of an effort to eliminate redundant operations 
cost of revenues for the career transition services segment decreased  from fiscal on a pro forma basis  cost of revenues decreased from  for fiscal to  for fiscal since the consummation of the acquisitions  management has proceeded with the consolidation of certain cost centers and the elimination of redundant operations 
this has resulted in a decrease compared to the pro forma cost of revenues for fiscal gross profits consolidated gross profits were  for fiscal or of revenues compared to  or for fiscal career transition services gross profit was  or of career transition services revenues for fiscal compared to  or of career transition service revenues for fiscal in the career transition services segment  although cost of revenues has been reduced  the timing of the reduction of costs in relation to the loss of revenue in the closed offices has resulted in a slight decrease in its gross profit margin 
enterprise recruiting services gross profit was  or approximately of enterprise recruiting services revenues for fiscal compared to  or of enterprise recruiting service revenues for fiscal as mentioned above  the reduction in redundant costs in the enterprise recruiting services segment has improved gross profit margins compared to the prior year 
pro forma gross profits were  or of revenues for fiscal compared to  or of revenues for fiscal reduction in redundant costs as well as the loss of low margin clients that were acquired prior to the purchase of the icarian business resulted in improved margin percentages 
operating expenses total operating expenses were  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal  an increase of  or 
acquisitions completed in fiscal accounted for  in total operating expenses 
operating expenses for non acquired operations were  for fiscal  representing an approximate decline compared to fiscal the primary reason for the decline in operating expenses for the operations that existed prior to the fiscal acquisitions is the consolidation of operating functions and the impairment of goodwill recorded in fiscal on a pro forma basis  operating expenses were  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal the decline in pro forma operating expense is due to the elimination of redundant costs  disposal of purchased intangibles and restructuring charges recorded by the acquired companies prior to their acquisition 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses were  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal  a decline of  or 
this decrease is attributed mainly to a reduction in advertising expense  and a reduction in employee costs for existing operations  partially offset by an increase in employee costs as a result of the acquisitions made in fiscal 
advertising expense was reduced by  in the career transition services segment by shifting advertising from newspapers and print media to the internet 
in addition  advertising expense was reduced in the enterprise recruiting services segment by  by implementing a more direct sales approach compared to an indirect approach used by prior management of the acquired operations and initially continued after the acquisitions 
on a pro forma basis  selling and marketing expenses were  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal the decline in selling and marketing expenses was due to the consolidation of marketing  advertising and public relations programs 
additionally  we have significantly reduced the sales and marketing staff in the acquired companies as part of the consolidation and integration into workstream 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal  an increase of  or  due principally to increased employee costs  space occupancy  equipment leasing costs  computing and communication expense  bad debt expense  postage  and professional fees  related to the companies we acquired during fiscal  as well as director fees for serving on our board  higher audit and accounting fees  and the impact of a full year of costs from the acquisitions made in fiscal on a pro forma basis  general and administrative expenses decreased from  for fiscal to  for fiscal the decrease is due to the elimination of redundant costs associated with the acquired companies 
research and development research and development costs were  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal  an increase of  or 
the acquisitions completed during fiscal accounted for  in research and development costs 
this increase was partially offset by a decline in research and development costs related to our existing operations as part of our strategy to acquire technology through acquisitions 
we believe that we can acquire new technology at a lower cost and more efficiently than developing new software platforms with internal resources 
we implemented this strategy in fiscal since fiscal most of our research and development efforts have been incurred in the enterprise recruiting services segment 
on a pro forma basis  research and development expenses were  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal significant reductions were made in research and development staff  most notably relating to the icarian operations 
amortization and depreciation expense amortization and depreciation expense was  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal  an increase of  or 
the majority of the increase  is due to the amortization of acquired intangible assets arising from acquisitions 
on a pro forma basis  amortization and depreciation expense was  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal the decline in amortization and depreciation expense on a pro forma basis was due primarily to the write down of software licenses and website development costs associated with the icarian and xylo acquisitions prior to and at the time of the acquisition 
interest income and other income interest and other income was  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal  a decrease of  or 
the decline was due to the reduction in short term investments 
short term investments as of may  were  compared to  at may  interest expense and other expense interest and other expense was  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal  an increase of  or 
the primary reason for the increase in interest and other expense was due to interest expense incurred as a result of the issuance of million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated convertible notes in april and may future period interest expense related to those notes will increase significantly as the notes accrete to their current face value of million over the remaining period to maturity 
goodwill goodwill was  as of may  compared to  as of may   an increase of  or 
the increase in goodwill relates to the acquisitions completed during fiscal and includes adjustments during the year for shares released from escrow to the former owners of paula allen holdings  as we achieved the specific revenue and profit targets set by the paula allen holdings acquisition agreement for the period ended december  additionally  management recorded during fiscal and fiscal  goodwill impairment charges totaling  related to the icarian  rezlogic and tech engine acquisitions  and  related to the paula allen holdings and omnipartners acquisitions  respectively 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues consolidated revenues were  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal  an increase of  or 
fiscal revenues from companies we acquired during fiscal represented  for the year ended may  revenues other than from companies we acquired in fiscal declined to  from  in fiscal as a result of discontinuing the e cruiter express product 
the e cruiter express product serviced companies with under employees 
we discontinued that product in an effort to focus more resources on companies with more than employees 
career transition services revenues for fiscal were  and were the largest contributor to total revenues in fiscal all of the revenue in this segment is attributable to the acquisition of paula allen holdings  acquired in july of fiscal and the addition of new offices during fiscal enterprise recruiting services revenues for fiscal were  compared to  for fiscal the increase in revenues was primarily due to the acquisition of rezlogic  omnipartners and figurejobs 
com in fiscal cost of revenues cost of revenues for fiscal were  compared to  for fiscal  an increase of  or 
while the total cost of revenues increased significantly due to the acquisitions made in fiscal  as a percentage of revenue these costs declined from approximately for fiscal to for fiscal the decline as a percentage of revenue is due to the fiscal acquisitions lower cost of delivery of products and services and our ability to consolidate technology

selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses were  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal  an increase of  or 
this increase is attributed to the acquisitions we made in fiscal commission expense for fiscal was approximately of the total selling and marketing expense 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal  an increase of  or  reflecting increased costs related to the companies we acquired during fiscal research and development research and development costs were  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal  a decrease of  or 
the decline is primarily due to the completion of various projects under development in prior periods and our strategy to acquire technology through acquisition 
amortization expense amortization expense was  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal  an increase of  or  with the amortization of acquired intangible assets representing the entire increase over the prior year 
interest income and other income interest and other income was  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal  a decrease of  or 
the significant decline was due to the decline in short term investments 
short term investments  including restricted cash  as of may  were  compared to  at may   which represented the remaining capital raised from our public offering in december interest expense and other expense interest and other expense was  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal  an increase of  or 
the primary reason for the increase in interest and other expense was due to the increase in both short and long term debt 
as of may   short and long term debt totaled  compared to  at may  the primarily reason for the increase was a result of the fiscal acquisitions and the expansion of operating units 
during fiscal  we recorded  of interest expense relating to our senior subordinated convertible notes issued in april and may of future period interest expense related to the notes will increase significantly as the notes accrete to their current face value of million over the remaining term to maturity 
goodwill goodwill was  as of may  compared to nil as of may  the goodwill relates to the acquisitions completed during fiscal and includes adjustments during the year for shares released from escrow to the former owners of paula allen holdings  as we achieved the specific revenue and profit targets set by the paula allen holdings acquisition agreement for the period ended december  additionally  management recorded goodwill impairment charges totaling  during fiscal related to the paula allen holdings and omnipartners acquisitions 
liquidity and capital resources at may   we had  in cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments and a working capital deficit of  we have made a significant investment in acquiring new service lines which has reduced working capital 
during fiscal  as a result of acquiring icarian  purecarbon and xylo  we assumed current liabilities which exceeded acquired current assets by  as of the respective dates of acquisition 
at may    of short term investment balances were restricted from use because they were collateral for various borrowing or leasing arrangements 
merchant banks have required us to place reserve deposits on our merchant accounts due to the high volume of credit card usage by our clients 
as of may   approximately  was held by such banks 
these deposits are reviewed quarterly and may be returned to us or increased based on activity surrounding credits issued 
additional deposits of  are restricted by two banks as security for an outstanding term loan  lines of credit and a letter of guarantee provided to a landlord for a facility lease 
these restricted cash balances will be reduced annually for rent payments and for any repayments on lines of credit 
for fiscal  cash used in operations totaled  consisting primarily of the net loss for the year of  offset mainly by non cash expenses such as amortization  non cash interest  and impairment write down of goodwill 
the net change in operating components of working capital  excluding acquisitions  for fiscal used cash of  primarily due to a decrease in current liabilities  partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable 
net cash from investing activities during fiscal was  in fiscal  we acquired cash of  from acquisitions consummated through share issuance 
additionally   was generated as a release of some of our restricted cash by the security holders 
net cash used in financing activities was  for fiscal financing outflows consisted primarily of the repayment of bank debt of  the repayment of loans to shareholders of  and capital lease payments of  in fiscal  we received  from a private investor in exchange of issuance of common stock and warrants 
michael mullarkey  our chief executive officer provided us with short term loans in the aggregate of  during fiscal and  during fiscal in fiscal those loans were consolidated into a term loan maturing in five years 
the consolidated term loan is collateralized by certain inventory  equipment  accounts receivable and other assets and bears interest at per annum 
under the consolidated term loan  we are required to make monthly interest only payments during the first months and monthly interest and principal payments thereafter 
as at may   the total amount of the consolidated term loan was  in addition  mr 
mullarkey has agreed to provide us with an additional  credit facility bearing interest at per annum 
with respect to each draw against the credit facility  we are required to make monthly interest only payments during the first months from the draw date and thereafter monthly interest and principal payments over a three year period 
we are allowed to draw against this credit facility as needed 
mr 
mullarkey also agreed to defer until june   a total of  in compensation earned as of may   with interest accruing on the balance at an annual rate of 
after june   mr 
mullarkey and workstream will mutually agree on the repayment terms of his deferred compensation 
management believes this credit facility and compensation deferral provided by mr 
mullarkey  and the closure of offices and reduction of costs made in fiscal and fiscal  along with further consolidation of cost centers and elimination of redundancies will result in cash flows from operations which  together with current cash reserves  will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements through may  at may   we had convertible notes with an outstanding balance of million 
in june   of the convertible notes were converted into series a convertible preferred shares  which were immediately converted into common shares 
the outstanding balance as of june is million which matures million in april and 
million in may we believe that the holders of the convertible notes will convert the notes into series a preferred shares or common shares before maturity  however  if they do not  we will be required to repay any outstanding balance remaining at the maturity date 
at may  maturities of debt outstanding  capital leases  operating leases and contractual obligations are as follows year ended may  thereafter total debt       capital leases     operating leases        contractual obligations   total        acquisitions we constantly endeavor to increase our share of  and strengthen our position in  the hcm market 
a key component of our business strategy is to continue to acquire companies offering services similar or complementary to ours 
the hcm market has experienced significant consolidation in the last years as companies attempt to expand their service offerings and broaden their revenue bases to achieve growth and profitability 
by implementing our business strategy and identifying the consolidation trend in its relatively early stages  we have been able to complete acquisitions of several companies which we believe complement our business 
on june   we acquired via merger of the outstanding shares of icarian  a california based company 
as consideration for the sale  we issued to the shareholders of icarian  common shares valued at approximately million 
icarian is a provider of web enabled solutions and professional services 
icarian s recruitment management suite is web native software  offered on an asp basis  with a user interface that provides functionality for management of the hiring process 
icarian s connectivity  interactive job site and reporting modules offer human resource professionals capabilities to integrate with human resource management systems  to manage candidates applications and job campaigns  and to produce reporting for both compliance and cost reporting for a corporation s employee acquisition process 
icarian had revenues of approximately million and it recorded a net loss of approximately million for the twelve months ended december  we recorded  in intangible assets and  in goodwill related to the acquisition of icarian 
in total  we have incurred approximately million in exit costs which were primarily associated with severance pay and facility closure costs to integrate the icarian acquisition 
in march  we entered into an agreement with icarian and the landlord of certain property being leased by icarian to terminate the lease between icarian and the landlord 
the landlord agreed to terminate the lease and release icarian from its financial obligations under the lease in exchange for certain furniture and equipment previously used at the property   in the form of a promissory note   common shares of workstream and cash of  the costs associated with the termination of this lease were applied against the accrual for exit costs 
as at may    remains outstanding  payable in monthly payments through october  on july   we acquired certain assets and liabilities of purecarbon  a california based company 
as consideration for the sale  we issued to the shareholders of purecarbon  common shares valued at  we have recorded  in intangible assets related to the acquisition of purecarbon 
the purchase agreement provides for additional common shares valued at  to be issued if purecarbon achieves certain revenue targets for the twelve months ending june  management has determined that the revenue targets were not met  and believes that those contingent shares will not be issued 
as required under the purchase agreement  an audit confirming whether the revenue targets were met is currently being performed 
purecarbon is the provider of award winning internet software jobplanet designed to integrate easily with behind the scenes human resources and recruiting technology 
jobplanet is built on a technology platform that enables clients to build and implement an employment web site that mirrors the client s corporate brand image 
we believe this front end platform fits well with our back end hiring management systems to create an end to end solution that our corporate clients desire 
on september   we acquired via merger of the outstanding shares of xylo  a washington based provider of web based employee retention management erm solutions focused on providing customized retention solutions to fortune companies 
xylo s work life customizable software offers employee programs in one externally hosted platform  giving clients control over content and applications 
xylo had revenues of million and it recorded a net loss of approximately million for the twelve months ended december  as consideration for the sale  we issued to the shareholders of xylo  common shares  valued at approximately million 
we recorded  in intangible assets and  in goodwill related to the acquisition of xylo 
under the purchase agreement  an additional  common shares may be issued if certain revenue targets are met for the twelve month period ending september we believe that these acquisitions have been important to our evolution from a recruitment application service provider into an hcm business process aggregator 
we believe that these additions will continue to broaden our revenue base and diversify our product offerings 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following risk factors that pertain to our company 
the realization of these risks could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  cash flows  business or the market for our common shares 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully address any of these risks or address them on a continuing basis 
keep these risk factors in mind when reading forward looking statements elsewhere in this form k 
see cautionary statement concerning forward looking statements in item we may not become profitable 
since our inception  we have incurred losses which have been substantial in relation to our operations 
as of may   the end of our most recent fiscal year  we had an accumulated deficit of  we reported a net loss of  for the year ended may  prior to our fiscal acquisitions  we generated relatively small amounts of revenue 
during fiscal and fiscal  of the nine companies that we acquired  six reported in the aggregate net losses of approximately million in their immediately preceding fiscal years 
our ability to reduce our losses will be adversely affected if we continue to acquire companies reporting losses  if revenue grows slower than we anticipate or if operating expenses exceed our expectations 
the accounting for the beneficial conversion feature relating to our convertible notes upon issuance the notes were recorded at a discount to the face value of the notes and will accrete over time to the full face value will result in significant interest charges to income over the term to maturity of the convertible notes  further affecting our ability to become profitable 
see note to our consolidated financial statements even if we do achieve profitability  we may not sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
failure to achieve or maintain profitability would materially adversely affect the market price of our common shares 
we expect our operating expenses to continue to grow as we expand our operations 
we may encounter difficulties with acquisitions  which could harm our business 
during fiscal and fiscal  we made several investments in  and acquisitions of  other companies and businesses  as part of our efforts to expand our operations and we may continue to make investments in  or acquisitions of  complementary companies  products and businesses 
if we acquire a company  we may have difficulty integrating that company s personnel  operations and products 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully integrate in a timely manner or at all these acquired companies  products or businesses into our operations 
these difficulties may increase our expenses  and our ability to achieve profitability may be adversely affected 
our largest shareholder may have interests that are different than other shareholders and may influence certain actions 
as of august   michael mullarkey  our chief executive officer  beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common shares 
we owe mr 
mullarkey approximately  under a consolidated term loan he provided to us 
the consolidated term loan is collateralized by certain inventory  equipment  accounts receivable and other assets 
mr 
mullarkey has also agreed to provide us with a  credit facility bearing interest at per annum which is also collateralized by the same assets 
these interests may influence how mr 
mullarkey votes on certain matters that require shareholder approval 
as our largest shareholder  mr 
mullarkey may influence the outcome of various actions that require shareholder approval including the election of our directors  delaying or preventing a transaction in which shareholders might receive a premium over the prevailing market price for their shares and preventing changes in control or management 
the current economic downturn and future economic downturns may adversely affect the demand for our services 
historically  the general level of economic activity has significantly affected the demand for employment and recruitment services 
we believe that we are currently experiencing the effects of the current economic downturn and as a result the demand for our employment and recruitment services has decreased 
if the general level of economic activity continues to slow  our clients may not require additional personnel and may delay or cancel plans that involve recruiting new personnel using our services and technology 
consequently  the time from initial contact with a potential client to the time of sale could increase and the demand for our services could decline  resulting in a loss of revenue harming our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  it is expected that in times of economic growth  demand for our outplacement business may decline 
we may not be able to grow our client base and revenue because of the number of competitors and the variety of sources of competition we face 
our future success will depend to a large extent on our ability to grow and maintain our client base and revenue 
this requires that we offer services that are superior to the services being offered by our competitors and that we price our services competitively 
we compete for a portion of employers recruiting budgets with many types of competitors  as employers typically utilize a variety of sources for recruiting  including o traditional offline recruiting firms  o traditional offline advertising  such as print media  o resume processing companies  o web based recruitment companies  o internet job posting companies  and o client server based software services 
in addition  many employers are developing or may develop their own software to satisfy their recruitment needs 
if we are unable to grow our client base and revenue  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the increasing competition in our markets could affect our ability to expand 
the market for human capital management  or hcm  services is highly fragmented and competitive 
we compete nationally and internationally with internet recruitment services companies  outplacement service companies and human resource  or hr  service providers 
we expect competition to increase and intensify in the future  with increased price competition developing for our services 
a number of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories and greater financial  technical and marketing resources and name recognition than we do which could give them a competitive advantage 
our competitors may develop products or services that are equal or superior to ours or that achieve greater market acceptance than ours 
it is also possible that new competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
as a result  we may not be able to expand or maintain our market share and our ability to penetrate new markets may be adversely affected 
if we experience client attrition  our operating results will be adversely affected 
since we generally enter into subscription agreements with our e cruiter enterprise clients for terms of one year or less  we have no assurance that the client will maintain a long term relationship with us 
if we lose clients after the expiration of their initial subscription  our business  revenues  operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected 
since we have only been offering our services for a limited period of time  we do not know what rate of client attrition to expect 
to the extent we experience significant client attrition  we must attract additional clients to maintain revenue 
we may not be able to strengthen and maintain awareness of our brand name 
we believe that our success will depend to a large extent on our ability to successfully develop  strengthen and maintain our brand recognition and reputation 
in order to strengthen and maintain our brand recognition and reputation  we invest and will need to continue to invest substantial resources in our marketing efforts and maintain high standards for actual and perceived quality  usefulness  reliability  security and ease of use of our services 
if we fail to successfully promote and maintain our brand name  particularly after incurring significant expenses in promoting our brand name  or encounter legal obstacles which prevent our continued use of our brand name  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected and the market price of our common shares could decline 
moreover  even if we continue to provide quality service to our clients  factors outside of our control  including actions by organizations that are mistaken for us and factors generally affecting our industry  could affect our brand and the perceived quality of our services 
our success will depend on our ability to enter into strategic relationships with job posting and other on line recruitment services to offer an attractive service to our clients and with a variety of third parties to expand the distribution of our services 
if we are unable to enter into successful strategic relationships  our business will suffer 
we must maintain our existing relationships with job posting boards and other on line recruitment services and enter into additional similar relationships to continue to offer an attractive service 
we also must enter into arrangements with third parties  such as value added service providers  to expand the distribution of our services 
because many of these third parties compete with each other  the existence of a relationship with any particular third party may limit or preclude us from entering into a relationship with that third party s competitors 
in addition  some of the third parties with which we seek to enter into relationships may view us as a competitor and refuse to do business with us 
any loss of an existing relationship or failure to establish new relationships may adversely affect our ability to improve our services  offer an attractive service in the new markets that we enter  or expand the distribution of our services 
we may not be able to expand our business successfully into new geographic markets 
until the fourth quarter of fiscal  we marketed our services primarily in canada 
since that time  we completed several acquisitions 
through these acquisitions we endeavored to enhance our business by penetrating the united states market 
our success and ability to grow our business will depend to a significant degree on our ability to market our services successfully in new geographic markets  including the united states 
penetrating new geographic markets involves the expenditure of substantial resources  including retaining additional highly qualified personnel 
failure to effectively penetrate new geographical markets may result in increasing losses and the loss of our investment  in whole or in part  in our acquisitions 
this could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may lose business if we are unable to successfully develop and introduce new products  services and features 
if we are unable to develop and introduce new products  services  or enhancements to  or new features for  existing products or services  in a timely and successful manner  we may lose sales opportunities 
the market for our services is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements  the introduction of new products and services  changes in client demands and evolving industry standards 
the adoption of new technologies or new industry standards may render our products obsolete and unmarketable 
the process of developing new services or technologies is complex and requires significant continuing efforts 
we may experience difficulties or funding shortages that could delay or prevent the successful development  introduction and sale of enhancements or new products and services 
moreover  new products  services or features which we introduce may not adequately address the needs of the marketplace or achieve significant market acceptance 
our business could suffer if financing is not available when required or is not available on acceptable terms 
our future capital requirements depend on a number of factors  including our ability to grow our revenue 
we believe that we have sufficient credit facilities  cash flow from operations and cash reserves  which  together with further cost reductions  will permit us to meet our working capital requirements and capital expenditure requirements through the end of fiscal however  it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds sooner than expected in order to fund expansion  develop new  and enhance existing  services or acquire complementary businesses or technologies or if our revenues are less or our expenses are greater than we expect 
our business could suffer if financing is not available when required or is not available on acceptable terms 
future financing may be on terms adverse to your interests 
in the past we have issued and  in the future we may issue  equity or convertible debt securities to raise additional funds 
as a result of new issuances  our shareholders may experience significant dilution of their ownership interest and holders of those new securities may have rights senior to those of the holders of our common shares 
if we are characterized as a passive foreign investment company  our us shareholders may suffer adverse tax consequences 
we believe that we were not a passive foreign investment company for us federal income tax purposes for fiscal years  and generally  we may be characterized as a passive foreign investment company for us federal income tax purposes if for any taxable year of our gross income is passive income  or at least of our assets are held for the production of  or produce  passive income 
this characterization could result in adverse us tax consequences to our shareholders 
these consequences may include having gains realized on the sale of our common shares treated as ordinary income  rather than capital gain income  and having potentially punitive interest charges apply to the proceeds of share sales 
us shareholders should consult with their own us tax advisors with respect to the us tax consequences of investing in our common shares 
our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our proprietary technologies 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the protection of our proprietary technologies and brand names 
the unauthorized reproduction or other misappropriation of our proprietary technologies could provide third parties with access to our technologies without payment 
if this were to occur  our proprietary technologies would lose value and our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
we rely upon a combination of copyright  trade secret and trademark laws and non disclosure and other contractual arrangements to protect our proprietary rights 
the measures we have taken to protect our proprietary rights  however  may not be adequate to deter misappropriation of proprietary information or protect us if misappropriation occurs 
policing unauthorized use of our technologies and other intellectual property is difficult  particularly because of the global nature of the internet 
we may not be able to detect unauthorized use of our proprietary information and take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights 
if we resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights  the proceedings could be burdensome and expensive and could involve a high degree of risk 
third parties could claim that we infringe upon their proprietary technologies 
our products  services  content and brand names may be found to infringe valid copyrights  trademarks or other intellectual property rights held by third parties 
in the event of a successful infringement claim against us and our failure or inability to modify our technologies or services  develop non infringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology  we may not be able to offer our services 
any claims of infringement  with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  divert management attention  require us to enter into costly royalty or licensing arrangements  modify our technologies or services or prevent us from using important technologies or services  any of which could harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
we may become subject to burdensome government regulation which could increase our costs of doing business  restrict our activities and or subject us to liability 
uncertainty and new regulations relating to the internet could increase our costs of doing business  prevent us from providing our services  slow the growth of the internet or subject us to liability  any of which could adversely affect our business  operating results and prospects 
in addition to new laws and regulations being adopted  existing laws may be applied to the internet 
there are currently few laws and regulations directly governing access to  or commerce on  the internet 
however  due to the increasing popularity and use of the internet  the legal and regulatory environment that pertains to the internet is uncertain and continues to change 
new and existing laws may cover issues which include o user privacy  o pricing controls  o consumer protection  o libel and defamation  o copyright and trademark protection  o characteristics and quality of services  o sales and other taxes  and o other claims based on the nature and control of internet materials 
computer viruses or software errors may disrupt our operations  subject us to a risk of loss and or expose us to liability 
computer viruses may cause our systems to incur delays or other service interruptions 
in addition  the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses or software errors in new services or products not detected until after their release could expose us to a material risk of loss or litigation and possible liability 
moreover  if a computer virus affecting our system is highly publicized or if errors are detected in our software after it is released  our reputation and brand name could be materially damaged and we could lose clients 
we may experience reduced revenue  loss of clients and harm to our reputation and brand name in the event of system failures 
we may experience reduced revenue  loss of clients and harm to our reputation and brand name in the event of unexpected network interruptions caused by system failures 
our servers and software must be able to accommodate a high volume of traffic 
we have experienced minor system interruptions in the past  and we believe that system interruptions will continue to occur from time to time in the future 
if we are unable to add additional software and hardware to accommodate increased demand  we could experience unanticipated system disruptions and slower response times 
any catastrophic failure at our network operations center could prevent us from serving our clients for a number of days  or possibly weeks  and any failure of our internet service provider may adversely affect our network s performance 
our clients may become dissatisfied by any system failure that interrupts our ability to provide our services to them or results in slower response times 
our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for any losses that may occur due to any failures in our system or interruptions in our services 
breaches of our network security could be costly 
if unauthorized persons penetrate our network security  they could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our services 
we may be required to spend capital and resources to protect against or to alleviate these problems 
in addition  because we host data for our clients  we may be liable to any of those clients that experience losses due to our security failures 
as a result  security breaches could have a material adverse effect on our business and the market price of our common shares may decline 
our business depends on internet service providers to provide satisfactory service to our clients to enable them to use our services and access job seeker candidates on line 
failure of internet service providers or on line service providers to provide access to the internet to our clients and job seekers would prevent them from accessing our web board  which would cause our business to suffer 
many of the internet service providers  on line service providers and other web site operators on which we depend have experienced significant service slowdowns  malfunctions  outages and capacity limitations 
if users experience difficulties using our services due to the fault of third parties  our reputation and brand name could be harmed 
our business depends on the development and maintenance of the internet infrastructure 
we cannot assure you that the internet infrastructure will continue to effectively support the demands placed on it as the internet continues to experience increased numbers of users  greater frequency of use and increased bandwidth requirements of users 
in the past  the internet has experienced a variety of outages and other delays 
the internet is also subject to actions of terrorists or hackers who may attempt to disrupt specific web sites or internet traffic generally 
any future outages or delays could affect the willingness of employers to use our on line recruitment offerings and of job seekers to post their resumes on the internet 
if any of these events occur  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
shares eligible for future sale by our shareholders could depress the market price for our common shares 
we have an effective registration statement registering the resale by certain holders of our securities of  common shares which are either outstanding or are issuable upon the exercise of warrants or conversion of convertible notes 
the common shares registered under the registration statement are eligible for resale in the public market without restriction at any time 
in addition  we have agreed to file a registration statement prior to september  registering the resale of  common shares   of which are issuable upon the exercise of warrants 
we also have granted a holder of  common shares piggyback registration rights 
this means that any registration statement that we file in the future registering common shares may require the registration of these shares  subject to certain restrictions 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  that the sale of these additional securities or the availability of these additional securities for sale will have on the market prices of our common shares prevailing from time to time  but it could depress the market price for our common shares 
our common shares have traded at prices below and could be subject to delisting by nasdaq 
our common stock currently trades on the nasdaq small cap market and the boston stock exchange 
under the nasdaq requirements  a stock can be delisted and not allowed to trade on the nasdaq if the closing bid price of the stock over a consecutive trading day period is less than 
the boston stock exchange  however  does not maintain a similar minimum price requirement 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  our common stock failed to meet the nasdaq minimum bid price requirement because the closing bid price for consecutive trading days was below 
on may   nasdaq gave us notice of this fact and gave us six months to cure this problem or our common stock would be delisted 
on july   nasdaq gave us notice that we regained compliance with the minimum bid price rule because the closing bid price of our common shares had been or more for at least consecutive trading days 
no assurance can be given that the closing bid price of our common shares will continue to satisfy the nasdaq minimum bid price requirements and thus continue to trade on the nasdaq small cap market 
although our common shares may remain listed on the boston stock exchange  if our common shares are delisted from the nasdaq small cap market  there may be a limited market for our shares  trading our stock may become more difficult and our share price could decrease even further 
if our common shares are not listed on a national securities exchange or nasdaq  potential investors may be prohibited from or be less likely to purchase our common shares  limiting the trading market for our stock even further 
the conversion of our convertible notes and preferred stock could result in substantial numbers of additional common shares being issued 
our senior subordinated convertible notes are convertible into a class of preferred shares designated series a convertible preferred shares  no par value per share the series a shares 
the conversion price of the notes into series a shares is per share  subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events 
the series a shares are convertible into a number of common shares determined by dividing by a floating conversion price based on the market price of our common shares  provided that the conversion price cannot exceed the lesser of or of the market price of our common shares for the five day period immediately preceding conversion 
the conversion price for the series a shares into common shares is subject to further adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events 
at the election of the holder  the notes may be converted directly into our common shares at a conversion price equal to of the average closing price of our common shares for the five day period before such conversion 
as a result  the lower that the price of our common shares is at the time of conversion  the greater the number of common shares the holder may receive 
to the extent the notes or series a shares are converted into common shares  a significant number of common shares may be sold into the market  which could decrease the price of our common shares 
the price of our common shares historically has been volatile  which may make it more difficult for you to resell our common shares when you want at prices you find attractive 
the market price of our common shares has been highly volatile in the past  and may continue to be volatile in the future 
for example  since june   the closing sale price of our common shares on the nasdaq small cap market has fluctuated between and per share 
the following factors may significantly affect the market price of our common shares o quarterly variations in our results of operations  o announcement of new products  product enhancements  joint ventures and other alliances by our competitors or us  o technological innovations by our competitors or us  o general market conditions or market conditions specific to particular industries  and o the operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable to us 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the market prices for internet related companies in particular  have experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our common shares  regardless of our operating performance 
see risk factor our common shares have traded at prices below and could be subject to delisting by nasdaq 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are primarily exposed to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risks our exposure to interest rate fluctuations relates primarily to our short term investment portfolio and our bank loans 
we invest our surplus cash in an investment trust established by a canadian chartered bank  and in a certificate of deposit in a bank in the united states 
the investment trust holds various short term  low risk instruments  and can be withdrawn without penalty at any time 
the interest income from these investments is subject to interest rate fluctuations which we believe will not have a material impact on our financial position 
we have established a cdn  line of credit with the bank of montreal which bears interest at the bank s prime rate plus 
we have drawn cdn  on this facility as of may  we can draw an additional cdn  before additional collateral would be required 
we also have a term loan with the bank in the amount of cdn  as of may  the term loan bears interest at the bank s prime rate plus 
additionally  we have a letter of credit issued in may as collateral on leased facilities in the amount of cnd  that will renew annually 
we pay an annual fee of on this letter of credit 
we also have a term loan and a credit facility from michael mullarkey  our chief executive officer  and convertible notes  which all bear interest at per annum 
the terms of these financing instruments are fixed and therefore do not expose us to interest rate fluctuations 
the majority of our interest rates are fixed  therefore we have limited exposure to risks associated with interest rate fluctuations 
the impact on net interest income of a basis point adverse change in interest rates for the fiscal year ended may  would have been less than  foreign currency risk we have monetary assets and liabilities denominated in canadian dollars 
as a result  fluctuations in the exchange rate of the canadian dollar against the us dollar will impact our reported net asset position 
a change in foreign exchange rates would result in a change in our reported net asset position of approximately
