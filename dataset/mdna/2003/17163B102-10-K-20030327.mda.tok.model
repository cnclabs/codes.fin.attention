business and industry overview ciber  inc and its subsidiaries provide information technology it system integration consulting and other it services 
we also resell certain third party it hardware and software products 
our services are offered on a project or strategic staffing basis  in both custom and enterprise resource planning erp package environments  and across all technology platforms  operating systems and infrastructures 
our clients consist primarily of fortune and middle market companies across most major industries and governmental agencies 
we operate from branch offices across the united states  plus offices in canada and europe 
our foreign operations accounted for of our total revenues in the custom solutions segment primarily includes our ciber custom branch offices and our ciber european operations 
our custom solutions segment provides it project solutions and it staffing in custom developed software environments 
our package solutions segment is comprised of our ciber enterprise solutions division and our subsidiary digiterra  inc the package solutions segment primarily provides enterprise software implementation services  including enterprise resource planning erp  supply chain management and customer relationship management software from software vendors such as jd edwards  lawson  peoplesoft  oracle and sap 
custom solutions accounted for approximately of revenues in compared to in  with package solutions accounting for the remainder 
we primarily provide consulting services under time and material or fixed price contracts 
the majority of our service revenues are recognized under time and material contracts as hours and costs are incurred 
for fixed price contracts  which make up approximately of our services revenues  revenue is recognized on the basis of the estimated percentage of completion 
changes in our services revenues are primarily a function of hours worked on revenue generating activities and our average rate per hour 
hours worked on revenue producing activities vary with the number of consultants employed and the utilization level of those consultants 
utilization for our consultants represents the percentage of time worked on revenue producing engagements divided by the standard hours available ie hours per week 
our average utilization rates are higher in our custom solutions segment typically around to as compared to our package solutions segment typically around to 
we work hard to manage both the number of consultants we have and our overall utilization levels 
if we determine we have excess available resources that we cannot place on a billable assignment in the near future  we consider reducing those resources 
as a result  in and  most of our consultant turnover has been from involuntary termination of employment 
the hourly rate we charge for our services varies based on the level of the consultant involved  the particular expertise of the consultant and the geographic area 
our overall average rate per hourly is also influenced by the results of our fixed price engagements  which can vary 
our average hourly billing rates are higher in our package solutions segment typically around to per hour as compared to our custom solutions segment typically around to per hour 
other revenues include resale of third party it hardware and software products as well as commissions on sales of it products 
our sales of it hardware and software generally involve it network infrastructure 
gross margins on product sales are typically to 
as a remarketer of certain it products  we recognize commission revenue net of product costs resulting in lower revenue and higher gross margin 
the market demand for ciber s products and services is heavily dependent on discretionary it spending by major corporations and organizations in the markets and regions that we serve 
most recently  the current economic downturn has negatively affected the operations of many of our clients and prospective clients  and has negatively impacted their it spending 
as a result  competition for new engagements has been strong 
we have responded to these business conditions by closely monitoring the utilization of our billable personnel  keeping non productive time to a minimum and by managing our selling  general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenue 
in the past few years the it services industry has faced a changing and challenging environment 
following is a brief overview of what we believe to be the key industry wide trends affecting us over the past few years 
through the middle of  major organizations spent heavily on it services in order to prepare their information systems for the potential problems presented by the year yk 
companies with information systems applications that were not yk compliant either fixed those systems by rewriting software code or by implementing new systems that were yk compliant 
after this period of spending on yk compliance ended  many existing corporations as well as funded startup entities spent heavily on systems that supported the conduct of business over the internet 
many new dot 
com businesses emerged which raised a great deal of private and public equity and used a significant portion of those proceeds on information systems to support their new business models 
along with these dot 
com businesses came new consulting firms that provided information technology services to support the ebusiness initiatives of both new dot 
com business entities and existing corporations wanting to conduct business over the internet 
several of these new consulting firms were successful raising capital in the public equity markets and were also successful gaining acceptance as experts in the newer internet technologies 
as a consequence  a disproportionate share of the dollars spent on ebusiness initiatives went to these new consulting firms 
beginning in the latter part of and into  many of these dot 
com entities did not have a cash flow stream to support their businesses as going concerns and consequently have gone out of business 
in addition  as the threat of these dot 
coms to traditional business models waned  traditional business spending on ebusiness it initiatives became more conservative 
as dot 
com entities began failing and it spending declined  many of the new internet consultancies that entered the market failed as well 
while the failure of many internet consultancies was competitively beneficial to ciber  by the middle of the us economy began a recession and large organizations further curtailed discretionary it spending 
these unfavorable economic conditions continue to dampen it spending as we enter business combinations as part of our ongoing growth strategy  we intend to continue to selectively identify and pursue the acquisition of complementary businesses to expand our geographic reach  service offerings and client base 
from to  we completed the following two significant business combinations acquired company date consultants added goodwill added decision consultants  inc april million metamor industry solutions  inc october million decision consultants  inc dci was our largest acquisition to date 
the majority of dci s revenues were from clients that were already ciber clients and most of dci s operations were in locations already served by ciber 
as a result  the primary asset acquired was the workforce that was in place  which is accounted for as part of goodwill 
like ciber  dci s consultants comprised an experienced technical workforce that we believe will help maintain and obtain business at both current and new clients 
dci also added depth to our executive and operation s management team 
the acquisition allowed us to combine many of the dci offices with existing ciber offices to obtain economies of scale resulting in reduced overhead costs as a percentage of revenues 
also significant were the cost savings to be realized by combining redundant corporate back office functions 
dci added significantly to ciber s existing consultant base at ibm  ford and verizon  among others 
in addition  the acquisition gave us opportunities at some new strategic clients  however  such clients did not constitute a significant percentage of dci s revenues 
metamor industry solutions  inc metamor provided custom software development and it staffing for federal and state local government agencies 
by combining metamor with ciber s existing federal and state local government operations  public sector clients now represent approximately of total revenues 
change in accounting for goodwill in accordance with the financial accounting standards board s statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january  goodwill is no longer amortized  but will be reviewed annually for impairment 
as a result  beginning january   our expense for amortization of intangible assets has decreased significantly 
our other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
during the first quarter of  we completed the transitional impairment test as required by sfas and it was determined that the change in accounting did not result in an impairment charge 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain statement of operations data  expressed as a percentage of total revenues years ended december  consulting services other revenues total revenues gross margin services gross margin other revenues gross margin total selling  general and administrative expenses operating income before amortization amortization of intangible assets goodwill impairment operating income loss interest and other income  net income loss before income taxes income tax expense net income loss the following table sets forth certain operating data for our reportable segments years ended december  in thousands services revenue custom solutions    package solutions    eliminations    percent of services revenue custom solutions package solutions services gross margin custom solutions package solutions year ended december  as compared to year ended december  total revenues increased to million in from million in this represents an increase in consulting services revenues  which was partially offset by a decrease in other revenues 
other revenues decreased to million in from million in due to decreased hardware sales 
custom solutions services revenues increased while package solutions services revenues decreased  when compared to last year 
overall  the revenue growth compared to was attributed to the acquisitions closed in the fourth quarter of and the first half of year over year  our average number of billable consultants increased to  in from  in the increase in custom solutions service revenue in was due to an average net increase of approximately consultants  combined with an increase in utilization levels to in from in the decrease in package solutions service revenues in was due to a combination of an average net decrease of approximately consultants  combined with a decrease in average billing rates 
in total  our gross margin percentage decreased to of revenues in from of revenues in this decrease is due to declining gross margins on consulting services offset partially by improved gross margins on other revenues 
custom solutions gross margin on service revenues decreased basis points in from the prior year 
this decrease was primarily due to the addition of decision consultants  inc dci in  which had slightly lower margins than ciber s other custom solutions operations 
package solutions gross margin on service revenues decreased basis points in from the prior year 
this decrease was due to lower utilization levels coupled with a decrease in average billing rates during also significant to the decline in overall services gross margins in was the fact that the lower margin custom solutions revenue accounted for of service revenue in compared to in our gross margin percentage on other revenues increased to in from in due to decreased sales on lower margin computer hardware products 
low margin computer hardware product sales accounting for of other revenues in compared to in  with higher margin commission revenue accounting for the remainder 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a decreased to million in from million in as a percentage of sales  sg a decreased to in from in  as we have made cost saving efforts to better align our sg a costs with our current revenue levels 
the cost saving initiatives began during the second half of and primarily included reduced personnel and facility costs 
a metric that demonstrates the positive impact of our overhead personnel cuts is the ratio of billable employees to overhead employees which increased to at december  from at december  in addition  we realized economies of scale with the acquisition of dci  as many of the acquired offices were combined with our existing offices 
in  we recorded million of severance costs and million of office closure costs that are included in sg a 
in connection with our reorganization of our digiterra and waterstone subsidiaries  during the fourth quarter of  we incurred severance costs related to certain executive management positions that were eliminated 
in addition  during we incurred expenses related to losses on excess office space that we had sub leased to other parties 
income from operations before amortization which is how we internally measure our segment operations increased in to million of revenues compared to million of revenues in amortization of intangible assets decreased to  in from million in due to the adoption of sfas no 
on january   we no longer amortize goodwill 
interest income and expense fluctuates based on our average cash balance invested or amounts borrowed under our line of credit 
interest expense increased in as we borrowed under our line of credit to fund our acquisition of metamor in october and again in may for our acquisition of dci 
other income increased to  in from  in other income increased  primarily due to  in gains on foreign currency exchange rates offset partially by  in losses on marketable security investments 
our effective tax rate was compared to in the decrease in our effective tax rate in is primarily due to the elimination of amortization expense relating to non deductible goodwill  offset in part by increased state and foreign taxes 
income tax expense includes benefits of  in and million in related to adjusting our prior years estimated federal and state tax liabilities to actual amounts upon completion of our tax returns 
year ended december  as compared to year ended december  total revenues decreased to million in from million in this represents a decrease in consulting services revenues and an decrease in other revenues 
other revenues decreased to million in from million in due to decreased hardware sales 
custom solutions services revenues decreased while package solutions services revenues decreased  when compared to the decrease in services revenues was primarily attributable to a decrease in billable consultants during the first half of the year  partially off set by the addition of consultants as a result of our acquisitions of century computer consultants  inc  aris corporation and metamor industry solutions  inc 
during the last four months of year over year  our average number of billable consultants decreased to  in from  in custom solutions average billable headcount decreased by consultants while package solutions decreased by consultants 
the decrease in average billable headcount resulted from our efforts to manage personnel consistent with the decrease in demand for our services 
in total  gross margin percentage decreased to of revenues in from of revenues in this decrease is due to declining gross margins on consulting services offset partially by improved gross margins on other revenues 
consulting services gross margins declined primarily due to a decrease in the utilization levels of our consultants as well as increased consultant costs 
custom solutions gross margin on consulting services decreased basis points in from the prior year 
this decrease was due to a decline in utilization levels to in from in package solutions consulting gross margin increased basis points in from the prior year 
this increase was the result of an improvement in utilization to in from in partially offset by higher consultant costs 
our gross margin percentage on other revenues increased slightly to in from in due to decreased sales of lower margin computer hardware products partially offset by a decline in gross margin on product sales due to pricing pressures 
product sales accounted for of other revenues in compared to in  with commission revenue accounting for the remainder 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a decreased to million in from million in  while as a percentage of sales  sg a increased to in from in this reflects the semi fixed nature of sg a as we were unable to reduce costs as quickly as the decline in revenues 
in september  we merged the operations of our subsidiary  waterstone  inc  into our custom solutions operations  suspending its brand and eliminating the related corporate overhead costs 
beginning in mid  in connection with our planned spin off of digiterra  we developed a corporate overhead structure for digiterra to prepare it to be an independent entity 
after we ended our plans to spin off digiterra  we reorganized digiterra s operations in the second half of and eliminated a large part of its corporate overhead costs 
we had estimated that these cost savings initiatives would save us approximately million annually 
in  we recorded million of severance costs and million of office closure costs that are included in sg a 
in connection with our reorganization of our digiterra and waterstone subsidiaries  during the fourth quarter of  we incurred severance costs related to certain executive management positions that were eliminated 
in addition  during  we incurred charges related to losses on excess office space that we had subleased to other parties 
in  we also recorded million of severance costs resulting from involuntary terminations related to personnel realignment   for an asset write down  and  of professional fees resulting from our planned spin off of digiterra 
income from operations before amortization and goodwill impairment which is how we internally measure our segment operations decreased to million of revenues for from million of revenues in amortization of intangible assets decreased to million in from million in this decrease was primarily due to the effects of the goodwill impairment charge recorded in the september quarter 
during the quarter ended september   we recorded a goodwill impairment of million to write down the goodwill associated with certain acquisitions 
this charge represents the amount required to write down the goodwill to our best estimate of the future discounted cash flows of these operations 
interest income and expense fluctuates based on our average cash balance invested or amounts borrowed under our line of credit 
net interest expense increased as we borrowed under our line of credit to fund our acquisition of metamor in october other income decreased to  in from  in  primarily due to reduced gains on sales of investments 
tax expense was million in as compared to million for the year ended december  tax expense was recorded for the year ended december   even though pre tax loss was reported  because most of the goodwill impairment charge was not deductible for income tax purposes since the majority of the impaired goodwill related to non taxable acquisitions 
our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to excluding the effects of the goodwill impairment charge in the decrease in our effective tax rate in  results from a million federal and state tax benefit from adjusting our prior year s estimate tax liability to actual amounts upon completion of our tax returns 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million of working capital and a current ratio of historically  we have used our operating cash flow plus the sale of stock and periodic borrowings under our line of credit to finance our operations and business combinations 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  our operating cash flow and our available line of credit will be sufficient to finance our working capital needs through at least the next year 
years ended december  in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    effect of foreign exchange rates on cash net increase decrease in cash and equivalents   cash provided by operations improved in compared to primarily due to improved results of operations  improved collections of receivables and a larger year end payroll accrual due to the timing of our normal bi weekly payroll cycle 
investing activities are primarily comprised of cash paid for acquisitions and purchases of property and equipment 
purchases of property and equipment have decreased because of the significant number of assets acquired through acquisitions as well as cost containment initiatives 
for our two largest acquisitions  we used million of net cash in for our acquisition of dci and million of net cash for our acquisition of metamor in october included in purchases of investments in was million for shares of ecsoft 
we acquired the remaining of ecsoft in january in  we received million for the sale of a building acquired through our acquisition of aris 
financing activities are primarily comprised of cash provided by sales of stock to employees and investors  cash used for the purchase of treasury stock and borrowing repayments under our line of credit 
in  we received net proceeds of million from a sale of stock to investors that was used to fund part of the dci acquisition consideration 
in connection with our acquisition of dci  we assumed million of dci debt  which we repaid  and we issued a million note payable as part of the purchase consideration that was subsequently repaid in we borrowed on our line of credit to partially fund our acquisitions of dci in and metamor in  and we reduced our line of credit with cash flow from operations and other items 
total accounts receivable decreased to million at december  from million at december   even though revenue increased 
this decrease is primarily due to our increased collection efforts 
total accounts receivable days sales outstanding dso improved to days at december  as compared to days at december  changes in accounts receivable have a significant effect on our cash flows 
items that can affect our accounts receivable dso include  contractual payment terms  client payment patterns including approval or processing delays and cash management  and our level of collection efforts 
many individual reasons are outside of our control 
as a result  our dso will normally fluctuate from period to period affecting our liquidity 
accrued compensation and related liabilities increased to million as of december  from million at december  this increase is due to a combination of the increase in our year end headcount to approximately  in from  in and the timing of our normal bi weekly us payroll cycle 
at december   there were twelve days of payroll accrued compared to eleven days at december  accounts payable and other accrued liabilities typically fluctuate based on when we receive actual vendor invoices and when payment is made 
the largest of such items  relate to vendor payments for it hardware and software products that we resell and payments to services related contractors 
in  we continued the repurchase of our common stock under our share repurchase programs 
at december   we had authorization for the repurchase of  shares 
on february   our board of directors authorized an additional  shares for repurchase 
we may continue to use cash to repurchase our common stock 
we have a reducing revolving line of credit agreement with wells fargo bank  na that expires september  in connection with acquisitions  the line of credit was amended in may and again in december to increase our maximum allowable borrowings 
at december   our borrowings were million while the maximum amount available to be borrowed is million 
the maximum available borrowing under the line of credit automatically reduces to million on april  and further reduces to million on september  and continues to reduce by million on the last day of each subsequent calendar quarter 
borrowings bear interest based on the bank s prime rate and ranges from prime less to prime less  depending on our ratio of indebtedness to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
on january   the bank s prime rate was and our borrowing rate was 
we are also required to pay a fee of per annum on the unused portion of the line of credit 
the line of credit is secured by substantially all of our assets 
the line of credit agreement contains certain financial covenants including maximum liabilities to tangible net worth  minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  maximum leverage ratio and a maximum coverage ratio 
the terms of the credit agreement also contain  among other provisions  specific limitations on additional indebtedness  liens and merger activity and prohibit the payment of any dividends 
effective january   we completed our acquisition of ecsoft group plc 
prior to the acquisition  ecsoft s shares were publicly traded on the london stock exchange 
we acquired all of the approximately million outstanding shares of ecsoft  not already owned by us  for cash consideration of pence approximately per share or approximately million in the aggregate 
in addition  we had previously acquired approximately million ecsoft shares in the open market at a cost of approximately million bringing our total cost for all of ecsoft s shares to approximately million  excluding transaction related costs 
we borrowed under our line of credit to finance the acquisition of ecsoft 
we plan to use part of ecsoft s expected cash balance of approximately million to reduce our borrowings 
ecsoft  which is incorporated under the laws of england and wales  has approximately employees and operations in denmark  the netherlands  norway  sweden and the united kingdom that provide information technology consulting services similar to ciber 
in connection with our acquisition of dci on april   dci s majority shareholder the shareholder entered into an agreement to not sell a significant portion of the ciber common stock received for a period of up to days the lockup agreement 
as an inducement for the shareholder to enter into the lockup agreement  ciber granted the shareholder an option that under certain circumstances  the shareholder can require ciber to repurchase up to  shares of ciber common stock in november at per share 
in november  we entered into an amended agreement with the shareholder to extend the option exercise period to may at december   the total cash redemption amount of million has been transferred from shareholders equity to temporary equity and is reflected on the line item contingent redemption value of put option on the balance sheet 
the actual acquisition of any such shares would be accounted for as treasury stock 
our reserve for accrued lease costs increased to million at december  from million at december this results from office locations that are vacant or that we have subleased at a loss 
we have recorded expense of approximately million in both and related to closure of certain offices 
primarily as a result of our acquisitions of aris  metamor and dci  we have assumed lease obligations for a number of facilities that are vacant 
the current market for office space in many of these areas has continued to be unfavorable 
while we have been successful in subleasing some of these vacant facilities to minimize our liability  in many cases we have accrued of the remaining liability  as sublease income is doubtful 
if  ultimately  any excess lease reserves related to leases acquired in business combinations is determined to exist  such amount will be recorded as a reduction of goodwill 
as we continuously evaluate our office facility needs compared to our level of operations  we may incur future charges related to office consolidation 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years long term line of credit   operating leases      purchase obligations    total      includes operating leases for all office locations and office equipment 
includes the million stock repurchase option in may with dci  discussed above 
seasonality we experience a moderate amount of seasonality 
typically our billable hours  which directly affect our revenues and profitability  are reduced in the second half of the year  especially during the fourth quarter  due to the large number of holidays and vacation time taken by our employees and our clients 
as a result  our operating income as a percentage of revenues is generally the lowest in the fourth quarter of each calendar year 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates including those related to revenue earned but not yet billed  costs to complete fixed price projects  the collectibility of accounts receivable  the valuation of goodwill  certain accrued liabilities and other reserves  income taxes  and others 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies and estimates are most critical to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and fixed price contracts we recognize revenues as we perform services for our clients 
we primarily provide consulting services under time and material or fixed price contracts 
the majority of our service revenues are recognized under time and material contracts as hours and costs are incurred 
under our typical time and materials billing arrangement  we bill our customers on a regularly scheduled basis  such as biweekly or monthly 
at the end of each accounting period we estimate and accrue revenue for services performed since the last billing cycle 
these unbilled amounts are actually billed the following month and any differences compared to estimates are accounted for 
the most common reason for differences between our accruals and actual bills relate to hour adjustments as time sheets are approved  late time sheets received  and rate changes 
for fixed price contracts  revenue is recognized on the basis of the estimated percentage of completion based on costs incurred relative to total estimated costs 
each contract has different terms  scope  deliverables and engagement complexities that require significant judgment 
the cumulative impact of any revisions in estimated revenues and costs are recognized in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
our ability to accurately predict personnel requirements and other costs  as well as to effectively manage a project or achieve a certain level of performance can have a significant impact on the gross margins related to our engagements 
also  with fixed price contracts  we are subject to the risk of cost overruns 
losses  if any  on fixed price contracts are recognized when the loss is determined 
collectibility of accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts at an amount we estimate to be sufficient to cover the risk of collecting less than full payment on our receivables 
our allowance for bad debts is based upon specific identification of likely and probable losses 
we review our accounts receivable and reassess our estimates of collectibility each month 
if our clients financial condition or liquidity were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments or if customers were to express dissatisfaction with the services we have provided  additional allowances may be required 
acquisition accounting in connection with acquisitions  we estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
some of the items  including accounts receivable  property and equipment  other intangible assets  certain accrued liabilities  and legal and other reserves require a high degree of management judgment 
valuation of goodwill we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill resulting from acquisitions 
effective january   goodwill is no longer amortized but is subject to annual impairment testing 
the impairment test involves the use of estimates related to the fair value of the business operations with which the goodwill is associated 
the estimate of fair value requires significant judgment 
any loss resulting from an impairment test would be reflected in operating income in our statement of operations 
valuation of other intangible assets in connection with our acquisitions  we are required to recognize other intangible assets separate and apart from goodwill if such assets arise from contractual or other legal rights or if such assets are separable from the acquired business 
other intangible assets include  among other things  customer related assets such as order backlog  customer contracts and customer relationships 
determining a fair value for such items requires a high degree of judgment  assumptions  and estimates 
in certain situations  where deemed necessary  we may use third parties to assist us with such valuations 
in addition  these intangible assets are to be amortized over the best estimate of their useful life 
accrued compensation and other liabilities employee compensation costs are our largest expense category 
we have a number of different variable compensation programs  which are highly dependent on estimates and judgments  particularly at interim reporting dates 
some programs are discretionary while others have quantifiable performance metrics 
certain programs are annual  while others are quarterly or monthly 
often actual compensation amounts cannot be determined until after our results are reported 
we believe we make reasonable estimates and judgments using all significant information available 
we also estimate the amounts required for incurred but not reported health claims under our self insured employee benefit programs 
our accrual for health costs is based on historical experience and actual amounts may vary 
in addition  with respect to our potential exposure to losses from litigation  claims and other assessments  we record a liability when such amounts are believed to be probable and can be estimated 
income taxes to record income tax expense  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
in addition  income tax expense at interim reporting dates requires us to estimate our expected effective tax rate for the entire year 
this involves estimating our actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences that result in deferred tax assets and liabilities and expected future tax rates 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
if we subsequently determine that we will realize more or less of our net deferred tax assets in the future  such adjustment would be recorded as an increase or reduction of income tax expense in the period such determination is made 
circumstances that could cause our estimates of income tax expense to change include the impact of information that subsequently becomes available as we prepare our tax returns  revision to tax positions taken as a result of further analysis and consultation  the actual level of pre tax income  changes in tax rules  regulations and rates  and changes mandated as a result of audits by taxing authorities 
new accounting standards in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas which supersedes emerging task force issue no 
 liability for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of the commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
this statement is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  and we do not expect that the adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
disclosure regarding forward looking statements and factors that may affect future results or the market price of our stock included in this report and elsewhere from time to time in other written and oral statements  are forward looking statements within the meaning of the united states private securities litigation reform act of words  such as anticipates  believes  could  expects  estimate  intend  may  opportunity  plans  potential  projects  should  and will and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
forward looking statements give our expectations about the future and are based upon our current expectations  estimates and projections 
these statements are only predictions and as such are not guarantees and involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict 
actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecast in such forward looking statements 
as a result  the statements speak only as of the date they were made  and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
we operate in a dynamic and rapidly changing environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties 
the following section describes some  but not all  of the risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and the market price of our common stock 
and could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward looking statements 
the continuation of current economic downturn  and future economic downturns  may cause our revenues to decline 
our results of operations are affected by the level of business activity of our clients  which in turn is affected by regional and global economic conditions 
as a result of the current difficult economic environment  some clients have cancelled  reduced or deferred expenditures for information technology products and services 
future deterioration of economic conditions could adversely affect our revenues 
our profitability will suffer if we are not able to maintain our pricing and utilization rates and control our costs 
our profit margin  and therefore our profitability  is largely a function of the rates we charge for our services and the utilization rate or chargeability  of our consultants 
accordingly  if we are not able to maintain the rates we charge for our services or an appropriate utilization rate for our consultants  we will not be able to sustain our profit margin and our profitability will suffer 
the rates we charge for our services are affected by a number of factors  including our clients perception of our ability to add value through our services  competition  introduction of new services or products by us or our competitors  pricing policies of our competitors  and general economic conditions 
our utilization rates are also affected by a number of factors  including seasonal trends  primarily as a result of holidays and vacations  our ability to transition employees from completed assignments to new engagements  our ability to forecast demand for our services and thereby maintain an appropriately balanced and sized workforce  and our ability to manage employee turnover 
we have implemented cost management programs to manage our costs  including personnel costs  support and other overhead costs 
some of our costs  like office rents  are fixed in the short term  which limits our ability to reduce costs in periods of declining revenues 
our current and future cost management initiatives may not be sufficient to maintain our margins as our level of revenue varies 
our business will be negatively affected if we are not able to anticipate and keep pace with rapid changes in technology 
our market is characterized by rapidly changing technologies  such as the evolution of the internet  frequent new product and service introductions and evolving industry standards 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to develop and implement technology services and solutions that anticipate and keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology  industry standards and client preferences 
we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely basis and our offerings may not be successful in the marketplace 
also  services  solutions and technologies developed by our competitors may make our service or solution offerings uncompetitive or obsolete 
any one of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain and successfully complete client engagements 
if our clients are not satisfied with our services  our ability to compete for future work and our financial condition may be adversely affected 
if we fail to meet our contractual obligations  we could be subject to legal liability  which could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
the provisions we typically include in our contracts which are designed to limit our exposure to legal claims relating to our services and the applications we develop may not protect us or may not be enforceable under some circumstances or under the laws of some jurisdictions 
it is possible  because of the nature of our business  that we will be sued in the future 
in addition  although we maintain professional liability insurance  the policy limits may not be adequate to provide protection against all potential liabilities 
moreover  as a consulting firm  we depend to a large extent on our relationships with our clients and our reputation for high quality services to retain and attract clients and employees 
as a result  claims made against our work may damage our reputation  which in turn  could impact our ability to compete for new work 
if we do not successfully integrate the businesses that we acquire  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
as an integral part of our business strategy  we intend to continue to expand by acquiring information technology businesses 
we regularly evaluate potential business combinations and aggressively pursue attractive transactions 
since january  we have completed acquisitions 
we may be unable to profitably manage businesses that we have acquired or that we may acquire or we may fail to integrate them successfully without incurring substantial expenses  delays or other problems that could negatively impact our results of operations 
acquisitions involve additional risks  including diversion of management s attention  difficulty in integration of the acquired business  loss of significant clients acquired  loss of key management and technical personnel acquired  assumption of unanticipated legal or other financial liabilities  becoming significantly leveraged as a result of debt incurred to finance acquisitions  unanticipated operating  accounting or management difficulties in connection with the acquired entities  impairment charges for acquired intangible assets  including goodwill that decline in value  and dilution to our earnings per share as a result of issuing shares of our stock to finance acquisitions 
also  client dissatisfaction or performance problems with an acquired firm could materially and adversely affect our reputation as a whole 
further  the acquired businesses may not achieve the revenue and earnings we anticipated 
we will continue to evaluate from time to time  on a selective basis  other strategic acquisitions if we believe they will help us obtain well trained  high quality employees  new service offerings  additional industry expertise  a broader client base or an expanded geographic presence 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying candidates or consummating acquisitions on terms that are acceptable or favorable to us 
in addition  there can be no assurance that financing for acquisitions will be available on terms that are acceptable or favorable 
we may issue shares of our common stock as part of the purchase price for some or all of these acquisitions 
future issuances of our common stock in connection with acquisitions also may dilute our earnings per share 
financial and operational risks of international operations could adversely affect us 
we expect to continue to expand our international operations 
our foreign operations accounted for of our revenues 
with our january acquisition of ecsoft group  we expect our international operations to be approximately to of our total revenues in we now have offices in eight foreign countries canada  denmark  germany  hungary  the netherlands  norway  sweden and the united kingdom 
international operations could cause us to be subject to unexpected  uncontrollable and changing economic and political conditions that could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the following factors  among others  present risks that could have an adverse effect on us the costs and difficulties relating to managing geographically diverse operations  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  differences in  and uncertainties arising from changes in  foreign business culture and practices  restrictions on the movement of cash  multiple  and possible overlapping or conflicting tax laws  the costs of complying with a wide variety of national and local laws  operating losses incurred in certain countries and the non deductibility of those losses for tax purposes  and differences in  and uncertainties arising from changes in legal  labor  political and economic conditions  as well as international trade regulations and restrictions  and tariffs 
we have certain significant client relationships and our contracts can be terminated by our clients with short notice 
our five largest clients accounted for of our revenues in the various agencies of the federal government represent our largest client  accounting for of total revenues 
we strive to develop long term relationships with our clients 
most individual client assignments are from three to twelve months  however  many of our client relationships have continued for many years 
our clients typically retain us on a non exclusive  engagement by engagement basis 
although they may be subject to penalty provisions  clients may generally cancel a contract at any time 
in addition  under many contracts  clients may reduce their use of our services under such contract without penalty 
if any significant client terminates its relationship with us or substantially decreases its use of our services  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
when contracts are terminated  we lose the associated revenue and we may not be able to eliminate associated costs in a timely manner 
in addition  contracts with the federal government contain provisions and are subject to laws and regulations that provide the federal government with rights and remedies not typically found in commercial contracts 
among other things  the federal and state governments may terminate contacts  with short notice  for convenience and may cancel multi year contracts if funds become unavailable 
we generate a significant portion of our revenue from projects to implement packaged software developed by others  including jd edwards  lawson  peoplesoft  oracle and sap 
our future success in the packaged software implementation business depends on the continuing viability of these companies and their ability to maintain market leadership 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain a good relationship with these companies or that they will maintain their leadership positions in the software market 
if we do not accurately estimate the cost of a large engagement which is conducted on a fixed price basis our revenue and profitably will be adversely affected 
we estimate that approximately of our revenues are from engagements performed on a fixed price basis 
for fixed price contracts  revenue is recognized on the basis of the estimated percentage of completion based on costs incurred relative to total estimated costs 
the cumulative impact of any revisions in estimated revenues and costs are recognized in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
losses  if any  on fixed price contracts are recognized when the loss is determined 
when proposing for and managing fixed price engagements  we rely on our estimates of costs for completing the project 
these estimates reflect our best judgment regarding the efficiencies of our methodologies and professionals as we plan to apply them to the project 
any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of fixed price contracts including delays caused by factors outside of our control could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable and may affect the amount of revenue reported in any period 
unfavorable government audits could require us to refund payments we have received  to forego anticipated revenue and could subject us to penalties and sanctions 
the government agencies we contract with generally have the authority to audit and review our contracts with them 
as part of that process  the government agency reviews our performance on the contract  our pricing practices  our cost structure and our compliance with applicable laws  regulations and standards 
if the audit agency determines that we have improperly received reimbursement  we would be required to refund any such amount 
if a government audit uncovers improper or illegal activities by us or we otherwise determine that these activities have occurred  we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  including termination of contracts  forfeitures of profits  suspension of payments  fines and suspension or disqualification from doing business with the government 
any such unfavorable determination could adversely impact our ability to bid for new work 
the it services industry is highly competitive  and we may not be able to compete effectively 
we operate in a highly competitive industry that includes a large number of participants 
we believe that we currently compete principally with other it professional services firms  technology vendors and the internal information systems groups of our clients 
many of the companies that provide services in our markets have significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
our marketplace is experiencing rapid changes in its competitive landscape 
some of our competitors have sought access to public and private capital and others have merged or consolidated with better capitalized partners 
these changes may create more or larger and better capitalized competitors with enhanced abilities to compete for market share generally and our clients specifically  in some cases  through significant economic incentives to clients to secure contracts 
these competitors may also be better able to compete for skilled professionals by offering them large compensation incentives 
in addition  one or more of our competitors may develop and implement methodologies that result in superior productivity and price reductions without adversely affecting the competitors profit margins 
in addition  there are relatively few barriers to entry into our markets and we have faced  and expect to continue to face  competition from new entrants into our markets 
as a result  we may be unable to continue to compete successfully with our existing or any new future competitors 
if we are unable to manage our growth  our profitability will be adversely affected 
our profitability is also a function of our ability to control our costs and improve our efficiency 
growth places significant demands on our management as well as on our administrative  operational and financial resources 
as we increase the number of our professionals and execute our strategy for growth  we may not be able to manage a significantly larger and or more diverse workforce  control our costs or improve our efficiency 
our future success depends on our ability to continue to retain and attract qualified employees 
we believe that our future success depends upon our ability to continue to train  retain  effectively manage and attract highly skilled technical  managerial  sales and marketing personnel 
employee turnover is generally high in it services industry 
if our efforts in these areas are not successful  our costs may increase  our sales efforts may be hindered  and or our customer service may degrade 
although we invest significant resources in recruiting and retaining employees  there is often significant competition for certain personnel in the it services industry 
from time to time  we experience difficulties in locating enough highly qualified candidates in desired geographic locations  or with required specific expertise 
in addition  we believe that there are certain key employees within the organization  primarily in the senior management team  who are necessary for us to meet our objectives 
due to the competitive employment nature of our industry  there is a risk that we will not be able to retain these key employees 
the loss of one or more key employees could adversely affect our continued growth 
in addition  uncertainty created by turnover of key employees could result in reduced confidence in our financial performance  which could cause fluctuations in our stock price and result in further turnover of our employees 
our debt may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility 
we have a million reducing revolving line of credit with a bank that expires in september we have used borrowings under our line of credit for consideration related to our acquisitions of metamor in  dci in and ecsoft in in the past  we have been successful in generating cash flow from operations to reduce our indebtedness 
we had outstanding borrowings under our line of credit of million at december  the level of our indebtedness could limit cash flow available for general corporate purposes  such as acquisitions  due to the ongoing cash flow requirements for debt service  limit our ability to obtain  or obtain on favorable terms  additional debt financing in the future for working capital or acquisitions  limit our flexibility in reacting to competitive and other changes in our industry and economic conditions generally  expose us to a risk that a substantial decrease in net operating cash flows due to economic developments or adverse developments in our business could make it difficult to meet debt service requirements  and expose us to risks inherent in interest rate fluctuations because of the variable interest rates  which could result in higher interest expense in the event of increases in interest rates 
our ability to repay or to refinance our indebtedness will depend upon our future operating performance  which may be affected by general economic  financial  competitive  regulatory  business and other factors beyond our control  including those discussed herein 
in addition  there can be no assurance that future borrowings or equity financing will be available for the payment or refinancing of any indebtedness we may have 
if we are unable to service our indebtedness  whether in the ordinary course of business or upon acceleration of such indebtedness  we may be forced to pursue one or more alternative strategies  such as restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness  selling assets  reducing or delaying capital expenditures or seeking additional equity capital 
there can be no assurances that any of these strategies could be affected on satisfactory terms  if at all 
our quarterly revenues  operating results and profitability will vary from quarter to quarter and other factors that may result in increased volatility of our share price 
our quarterly revenues  operating results and profitability have varied in the past and are likely to vary significantly from quarter to quarter  making them difficult to predict 
this may lead to volatility in our share price 
the changes in the market price of our common stock may also be for reasons unrelated to our operating performance 
some other factors that may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially  include the failure to be awarded a significant contract on which we have bid  the termination by a client of a material contract  announcement of new services by us or our competitors  announcement of acquisitions or other significant transactions by us or our competitors  changes in or failure to meet earnings estimates by securities analysts  sales of common stock by ciber or existing shareholders  or the perception that such sales may occur  adverse judgments or settlements obligating us to pay liabilities  changes in management  general economic conditions and overall stock market volatility  and changes in or the application of us generally accepted accounting principles 
we have adopted anti takeover defenses that could make it difficult for another company to acquire control of ciber or limit the price investors might be willing to pay for our stock 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could delay the removal of incumbent directors and could make a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving us more difficult  even if such events would be beneficial to the interests of the stockholders 
these provisions include adoption of a preferred stock purchase rights agreement  commonly known as a poison pill that gives our board the ability to issue preferred stock and determine the rights and designations of the preferred stock at any time without stockholder approval 
the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or of discouraging a third party from acquiring  a majority of the outstanding voting stock of ciber 
in addition  the staggered terms of our board of directors could have the effect of delaying or deferring a change in control 
the above factors and certain provisions of the delaware general corporation law may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or otherwise delaying or preventing changes in the control or management of ciber  including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium over the then current market for their shares of ciber common stock 
our chairman of the board owns sufficient shares of our common stock and can significantly affect the results of any shareholder vote 
our chairman of the board of directors and founder  bobby g 
stevenson  beneficially owns approximately of our common stock 
as a result  mr 
stevenson has the ability to significantly influence the outcome of matters requiring a shareholder vote  including the election of the board of directors  amendments to our organizational documents  or approval of any merger  sale of assets or other major corporate transaction 
the interests of mr 
stevenson may differ from the interests of our other shareholders  and mr 
stevenson may be able to delay or prevent us from entering into transactions that would result in a change in control  including transactions in which our shareholders might otherwise receive a premium over the then current market price for their shares 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and equity prices 
we believe our exposure to market risks is immaterial 
our exposure to changes in foreign currency rates primarily relates to our net investment in our foreign subsidiaries and to working capital advances provided to certain foreign operations 
during the year ended december   approximately of our total revenue was attributable to foreign operations 
ciber does not enter into forward exchange contracts as a hedge against foreign currency exchange risk on transactions denominated in foreign currencies or for speculative or trading purposes 
our exposure to changes in interest rates arises primarily because our indebtedness under our bank line of credit has a variable interest rate 
our investments in marketable equity securities are subject to risk of changes in market prices
