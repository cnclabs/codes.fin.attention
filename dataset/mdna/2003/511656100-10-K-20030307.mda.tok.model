noninterest income was million in versus million in  an increase of million  or 
the increase was driven by a million  or  increase in service charges on deposit accounts which was largely due to fees related to new deposit services which were implemented in the first quarter of  as well as fees associated with business checking accounts

noninterest income was million in versus million in  an increase of million  or 
the largest contributor to the increase was a one time gain of  relating to the sale of five non strategic branches in the increase in noninterest income was also reflective of the falling rate environment which encouraged new mortgage and mortgage refinancing activity

the company added one new office during since  the company has added fifteen new offices through acquisition and internal growth 
the company opened an office in dekalb county in november  the company intends to open a thirteenth office in kosciusko county in and also continues to evaluate additional expansion opportunities 
the company will consider future acquisition and expansion opportunities with an emphasis on markets that it believes would be receptive to its business philosophy of local  independent banking 
the company sold five southern market branches during the third quarter of in order to help position the company to focus on growth opportunities in its core northern markets  which are anchored by the cities of warsaw  fort wayne  elkhart and south bend  indiana 
total assets of the company were billion as of december   an increase of million  or  when compared to billion as of december  total cash and cash equivalents increased by million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the increase was primarily attributable to funding needs associated with a corresponding increase in the company s deposits 
total securities available for sale increased by million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the increase was a result of a number of transactions in the securities portfolio 
paydowns of million were received  and the amortization of premiums  net of the accretion of discounts  was million 
maturities  calls and sales of securities totaled million 
these portfolio decreases were offset by securities purchases totaling million and an increase of million in the fair value of the securities 
the investment portfolio is managed to limit the company s exposure to risk and contains mostly collateralized mortgage obligations and other securities which are either directly or indirectly backed by the federal government or a local municipal government 
the investment portfolio did not contain any corporate debt instruments or trust preferred instruments as of december  real estate mortgages held for sale increased by million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the balance of this asset category is subject to a high degree of variability depending on  among other things  recent mortgage loan rates and the timing of loan sales into the secondary market 
during  million in real estate mortgages were originated for sale and million in mortgages were sold  compared to and in total loans  excluding real estate mortgages held for sale  increased by million or to million at december  from million at december  the mix of loan types within the company s portfolio extended a trend toward a higher percentage of the total loan portfolio being in commercial loans 
the portfolio at year end reflected commercial  real estate and consumer loans compared to commercial  real estate and consumer loans at december  at december   the allowance for loan losses was million  or of total loans outstanding  versus million  or  of total loans outstanding at december  the process of identifying probable credit losses is a subjective process 
therefore  the company maintains a general allowance to cover probable credit losses within the entire portfolio 
the methodology management uses to determine the adequacy of the loan loss reserve includes the following considerations 
the company has a relatively high percentage of commercial and commercial real estate loans  most of which are extended to small or medium sized businesses 
commercial loans represent higher dollar loans to fewer customers and therefore higher credit risk 
pricing is adjusted to manage the higher credit risk associated with these types of loans 
the majority of fixed rate mortgage loans  which represent increased interest rate risk  are sold in the secondary market  as well as some variable rate mortgage loans 
the remainder of the variable rate mortgage loans and a small number of fixed rate mortgage loans are retained 
management believes the allowance for loan losses is at a level commensurate with the overall risk exposure of the loan portfolio 
however  as a result of the difficult economic climate  certain borrowers may experience difficulty and the level of nonperforming loans  charge offs  and delinquencies could rise and require further increases in the provision 
loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that the collectibility of the principal is unlikely 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
the allowance is an amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb probable incurred losses relating to specifically identified loans based on an evaluation as well as other probable incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the evaluations take into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  overall portfolio quality  review of specific problem loans  and current economic conditions that may affect the borrower s ability to repay 
management also considers trends in adversely classified loans based upon a monthly review of those credits 
since december   the percentage of loans internally adversely classified has increased 
in accordance with fasb statements and  the allowance is provided for losses that have been incurred as of the balance sheet date and is based on past events and current economic conditions  and does not include the effects of expected losses on specific loans or groups of loans that are related to future events or expected changes in economic conditions 
the company has experienced growth in total loans over the last three years of million  or 
the concentration of this loan growth was in the commercial loan portfolio 
commercial loans comprised  and of the total loan portfolio at december   and traditionally  this type of lending may have more credit risk than other types of lending because of the size and diversity of the credits 
the company manages this risk by adjusting its pricing to the perceived risk of each individual credit and by diversifying the portfolio by customer  product  industry and geography 
management believes that it is prudent to continue to provide for loan losses in a manner consistent with its historical approach due to loan growth described above and current economic conditions 
as a result of the methodology in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  the provision for loan losses was million in versus million in at december   total nonperforming loans increased by million to million from million at december  loans delinquent days or more that were included in the accompanying financial statements as accruing totaled million versus  at december  total impaired loans decreased by million to million at december  from million at december  the increase in loans delinquent days or more and still accruing resulted primarily from one commercial credit totaling million 
the renewal of this loan has been complicated as more than one bank is involved  and therefore it is past maturity 
while this loan is current as to principal and interest  there can be no assurance that it will remain current given the circumstances involved 
the increase in nonperforming loans resulted from the addition of the aforementioned loan and one additional commercial loan of million 
the decrease in impaired loans was due primarily to the removal of one credit that had a balance of million at december  offset by the addition of the aforementioned loan of million 
the impaired loan that was removed from impaired status has been current on principle and interest for most of and was recently restructured as a personal loan to the principal of the corporate entity with the support of both the existing collateral and new collateral in the form of life insurance and additional pledged securities 
in addition  full payment under the loan terms continues to be expected 
the impaired loan total includes million in nonaccrual loans 
the company allocated million and million of the allowance for loan losses to the impaired loans in and a loan is impaired when full payment under the original loan terms is not expected 
impairment is evaluated in total for smaller balance loans of similar nature such as residential mortgage  consumer  and credit card loans  and on an individual loan basis for other loans 
if a loan is impaired  a portion of the allowance may be allocated so that the loan is reported  net  at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan s existing rate or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral 
overall  the trend in nonperforming loans reflects the softened economic conditions in some of the company s markets  as well as the general economic weakness prevalent throughout much of the country 
the company believes that its overall expansion strategy has employed a credit risk management approach that promotes diversification and therefore creates a balanced portfolio with appropriate risk parameters 
total deposits increased by million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the increase resulted from increases of million in certificates of deposit  million in demand deposits  million in now accounts and million in savings accounts 
offsetting these increases were declines of million in investors weekly accounts and million in money market accounts 
total short term borrowings decreased by million  or  to million at december  from million at december  the decrease resulted primarily from a million decline in securities sold under agreements to repurchase combined with a million decline in federal funds purchases and a million decline in other borrowings  primarily short term advances from the federal home loan bank of indianapolis 
the company believes that a strong  appropriately managed capital position is critical to long term earnings and expansion 
bank regulatory agencies exclude the market value adjustment created by sfas no 
afs adjustment from capital adequacy calculations 
excluding this adjustment from the calculation  the company had a total risk based capital ratio of and tier i risk based capital ratio of as of december  these ratios met or exceeded the federal reserve s well capitalized minimums of and  respectively 
the ability to maintain and grow these ratios is a function of the balance between net income and a prudent dividend policy 
total stockholders equity increased by to million as of december   from million as of december  the increase in resulted from net income of million less the following factors cash dividends of million  a favorable change in the afs adjustment of million  net of tax  a negative minimum pension liability adjustment of  net of tax  and  for the purchase of treasury stock 
the afs adjustment reflected a basis point decrease in the two to five year us treasury rates during total stockholders equity increased by to million as of december   from  million as of december  the increase in resulted from net income of million less the following factors cash dividends of million  a favorable change in the afs adjustment of million  net of tax  a negative minimum pension liability adjustment of  net of tax  and  for the purchase of treasury stock 
this afs adjustment reflected a basis point decrease in the two to five year us treasury rates during due to the fact that the securities portfolio is primarily fixed rate  a negative equity adjustment would likely occur if interest rates increased 
management has factored this into the determination of the size of the afs portfolio to assure that stockholders equity is adequate under various scenarios 
other than those indicated in this management s discussion  management is not aware of any known trends  events or uncertainties that would have a material effect on the company s liquidity  capital and results of operations 
in addition  management is not aware of any regulatory recommendations that  if implemented  would have such an effect 
certain of the company s accounting policies are important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition  since they require management to make difficult  complex or subjective judgments  some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain 
estimates associated with these policies are susceptible to material changes as a result of changes in facts and circumstances 
some of the facts and circumstances which could affect these judgments include changes in interest rates  in the performance of the economy or in the financial condition of borrowers 
management believes that its critical accounting policies include determining the allowance for loan losses  determining the fair value of securities and other financial instruments and the valuation of mortgage servicing rights 
liquidity management maintains a liquidity position that it believes will adequately provide funding for loan demand and deposit run off that may occur in the normal course of business 
the company relies on a number of different sources in order to meet these potential liquidity demands 
the primary sources are increases in deposit accounts and cash flows from loan payments and the securities portfolio 
given current prepayment assumptions  the cash flow from the securities portfolio is expected to provide approximately million of funding in in addition to these primary sources of funds  management has several secondary sources available to meet potential funding requirements 
as of december   the company had million in federal fund lines with correspondent banks and may borrow up to million at the federal home loan bank of indianapolis 
the company has its securities in the available for sale afs portfolio 
therefore the company may sell securities to meet funding demands 
management believes that the securities in the afs portfolio are of high quality and would therefore be marketable 
approximately of this portfolio is comprised of us treasury securities  federal agency securities or mortgage backed securities directly or indirectly backed by the federal government 
in addition  the company has historically sold mortgage loans on the secondary market to reduce interest rate risk and to create an additional source of funding 
during  cash and cash equivalents increased million from million as of december  to million as of december  a million increase in deposit balances was the primary driver behind this change 
other sources of funds included proceeds from the sale of loans of million  proceeds from calls and maturities of securities totaling million and proceeds from long term borrowings of million 
uses of funds were purchases of securities of million  an increase in net loans of million  which is net of approximately million of loans originated and sold during  and an increase in other assets of million due primarily to payments for an investment in bank owned life insurance totaling million 
during  cash and cash equivalents decreased million from million as of december to million as of december  the primary reason for this decrease was the effect of the branch sale 
other uses of funds were purchases of securities  an increase in loans and payments for the branch sale 
purchases of securities totaled million 
net loans increased million in  which was net of approximately million of loans originated and sold during payments for the branch sale were million 
the major sources of funds included proceeds from sales  calls and maturities of securities of million and proceeds from the sale of loans of million 
lower interest rates created more demand for residential real estate mortgage loans and resulted in an increase in proceeds from the sale of mortgage loans 
during  cash and cash equivalents increased million from million to million as of december  a million increase in deposit balances was the primary driver behind this change 
other sources of funds included proceeds from calls and maturities of securities totaling million and proceeds from the sales of loans of million 
a rising rate environment contributed to a slowing demand for residential real estate mortgage loans and resulted in a decrease in proceeds from the sale of mortgage loans 
in addition  the company did not generate any securities gains in versus securities gains of million in the major uses of funds included an increase in loans  purchases of securities and fixed asset additions 
loans increased approximately million  which was net of approximately million of loans originated and sold during purchases of securities totaled million and purchases of land  premises and equipment were million 
the following tables disclose information on the maturity of the company s contractual long term obligations and commitments

while management believes that inflation affects the growth of total assets  it believes that it is difficult to assess the overall impact 
management believes this to be the case due to the fact that generally neither the timing nor the magnitude of the inflationary changes in the consumer price index cpi coincides with changes in interest rates 
the price of one or more of the components of the cpi may fluctuate considerably and thereby influence the overall cpi without having a corresponding affect on interest rates or upon the cost of those goods and services normally purchased by the company 
in years of high inflation and high interest rates  intermediate and long term interest rates tend to increase  thereby adversely impacting the market values of investment securities  mortgage loans and other long term fixed rate loans 
in addition  higher short term interest rates caused by inflation tend to increase the cost of funds 
in other years  the reverse situation may occur 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset liability management alco and securities interest rate risk represents the company s primary market risk exposure 
the company does not have material exposure to foreign currency exchange risk  does not own any material derivative financial instruments and does not maintain a trading portfolio 
the board of directors annually reviews and approves the alco policy used to manage interest rate risk 
this policy sets guidelines for balance sheet structure  which are designed to protect the company from the impact that interest rate changes could have on net income  but does not necessarily indicate the effect on future net interest income 
given the company s mix of interest bearing liabilities and interest bearing assets on december   the net interest margin could be expected to decline in a falling interest rate environment and conversely  to increase in a rising rate environment 
during  the federal open market committee fomc lowered the target for the federal funds rate on eleven occasions  decreasing the rate from on january  to by december   a total of basis points 
these actions caused a corresponding decrease in lake city bank s prime rate from to 
due to the asset sensitive nature of the balance sheet  these rate decreases had an adverse impact on the company s net interest margin during fiscal this low rate environment continued to have an adverse effect on the company s net interest margin during fiscal year in november of  the fomc lowered the fed funds target rate another 
to 
lake city bank s prime rate was also lowered 
to  which had an additional adverse effect on the net interest margin due to the asset sensitivity of the balance sheet 
the company utilizes a computer program to stress test the balance sheet under a wide variety of interest rate scenarios 
the model quantifies the income impact of changes in customer preference for products  basis risk between the assets and the liabilities that support them and the risk inherent in different yield curves  as well as other factors 
the alco committee reviews these possible outcomes and makes loan  investment and deposit decisions that maintain reasonable balance sheet structure in light of potential interest rate movements 
although management does not consider gap ratios in this planning  the information can be used in a general fashion to look at asset and liability mismatches 
the company s cumulative repricing gap ratio as of december   for the next months  was of earning assets 
the following tables provide information regarding the company s financial instruments used for purposes other than trading that are sensitive to changes in interest rates
