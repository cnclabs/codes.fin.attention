west texas gulf pipe line on november   the partnership acquired a interest in the west texas gulf pipe line company west texas gulf  a joint venture that owns and operates a mile common carrier crude oil pipeline 
other owners of west texas gulf are chevrontexaco  bp  and citgo 
the system originates from the west texas oil fields at colorado city and the nederland crude oil import terminals and extends to longview  texas where deliveries are made to several pipelines  including mid valley pipeline 
the pipeline was built in shippers on the pipeline are the partnership  sunoco  an affiliate of one other owner and several unaffiliated customers 
the partnership receives a quarterly cash dividend from west texas gulf that is commensurate with its ownership interest 
crude oil acquisition and marketing in addition to receiving tariff revenues for transporting crude oil on the western pipeline system  the partnership generates most of its revenues through its crude oil acquisition and marketing operations  primarily in 
table of contents oklahoma and texas 
these activities include purchasing crude oil at the wellhead from producers and in bulk from aggregators at major pipeline interconnections and trading locations  transporting crude oil on the partnership s pipelines and trucks or  when necessary or cost effective  pipelines or trucks owned and operated by third parties  and marketing crude oil to refiners or resellers 
the marketing of crude oil is complex and requires detailed knowledge of the crude oil market and a familiarity with a number of factors  including types of crude oil  individual refinery demand for specific grades of crude oil  area market price structures for different grades of crude oil  location of customers  availability of transportation facilities  timing  and customers costs including storage 
the partnership sells crude oil to major integrated oil companies  independent refiners  including sunoco r m for its tulsa and toledo refineries  and other resellers in various types of sale and exchange transactions  at market prices for terms generally ranging from one month to one year 
the partnership mitigates most of its pricing risk on purchased contracts by selling crude oil for an equal term on a similar pricing basis 
the partnership also mitigates most of its volume risk by entering into sales agreements  generally at the same time that purchase agreements are executed  at similar volumes 
as a result  volumes sold are generally equal to volumes purchased 
the partnership enters into contracts with producers at market prices generally for a term of one year or less  with a majority of the transactions on a day renewable basis 
for the year ended december   the partnership purchased approximately  bpd from approximately  producers from approximately  leases and undertook approximately  bpd of exchanges and bulk purchases during the same period 
crude oil lease purchases and exchanges in a typical producer s operation  crude oil flows from the wellhead to a separator where the petroleum gases are removed 
after separation  the producer treats the crude oil to remove water  sand  and other contaminants and then moves it to an on site storage tank 
when the tank is full  the producer contacts the partnership s field personnel to purchase and transport the crude oil to market 
the crude oil in producers tanks is then either delivered to the partnership s pipeline or transported via truck to the partnership s pipeline or a third party s pipeline 
the trucking services are performed either by the partnership s truck fleet or third party trucking operations 
the partnership also enters into exchange agreements to enhance margins throughout the acquisition and marketing process 
when opportunities arise to increase its margin or to acquire a grade of crude oil that more nearly matches its delivery requirement or the preferences of its refinery customers  the partnership s physical crude oil is exchanged with third parties 
generally  the partnership enters into exchanges to acquire crude oil of a desired quality in exchange for a common grade crude oil or to acquire crude oil at locations that are closer to the partnership s end markets  thereby reducing transportation costs 
the following table shows the partnership s average daily volume for the crude oil lease purchases and exchanges for the years presented year ended december  in thousands of bpd lease purchases available for sale exchanged other exchanges and bulk purchases total 
table of contents the partnership s business practice is generally to purchase only crude oil for which there is a corresponding sale agreement for physical delivery of crude oil to a third party or a sunoco r m refinery 
through this process  the partnership seeks to maintain a position that is substantially balanced between crude oil purchases and future delivery obligations 
the partnership does not acquire and hold crude oil futures contracts or enter into other commodity derivative contracts 
the following table shows the average daily sales and exchange volume of crude oil for the years presented year ended december  in thousands of bpd sunoco r m refineries toledo tulsa third parties exchanges purchased at the lease other total market conditions market conditions impact the partnership s sales and marketing strategies 
during periods when demand for crude oil is weak  the market for crude oil is often in contango  meaning that the price of crude oil in a given month is less than the price of crude oil for delivery in a subsequent month 
in a contango market  storing crude oil is favorable because storage owners at major trading locations can simultaneously purchase production at low current prices for storage and sell at higher prices for future delivery 
when there is a higher demand than supply of crude oil in the near term  the market is backwardated  meaning that the price of crude oil in a given month exceeds the price of crude oil for delivery in a subsequent month 
a backwardated market has a positive impact on marketing margins because crude oil marketers can continue to purchase crude oil from producers at a fixed premium to posted prices while selling crude oil at a higher premium to such prices 
producer services crude oil purchasers who buy from producers compete on the basis of competitive prices and highly responsive services 
through its team of crude oil purchasing representatives  the partnership maintains ongoing relationships with more than  producers 
management of the partnership believes that its ability to offer competitive pricing and high quality field and administrative services to producers is a key factor in its ability to maintain volume of lease purchased crude oil and to obtain new volume 
field services include efficient gathering capabilities  availability of trucks  willingness to construct gathering pipelines where economically justified  timely pickup of crude oil from storage tanks at the lease or production point  accurate measurement of crude oil volume received  avoidance of spills  and effective management of pipeline deliveries 
accounting and other administrative services include securing division orders statements from interest owners affirming the division of ownership in crude oil purchased by the partnership  providing statements of the crude oil purchased each month  disbursing production proceeds to interest owners  and calculating and paying production taxes on behalf of interest owners 
in order to compete effectively  records of title and division order interests must be maintained by the partnership in an accurate and timely manner for purposes of making prompt and correct payment of crude oil production proceeds  together with the correct payment of all production taxes associated with these proceeds 
credit with customers when crude oil is marketed  the partnership must determine the amount of any line of credit to be extended to a customer 
since typical sales transactions can involve tens of thousands of barrels of crude oil  the risk of nonpayment and nonperformance by customers is a major consideration in this business 
management of the 
table of contents partnership believes that its sales are made to creditworthy entities or entities with adequate credit support 
credit review and analysis are also integral to the partnership s lease purchases 
payment for substantially all of the monthly lease production is sometimes made to the operator of the lease 
the operator  in turn  is responsible for the correct payment and distribution of such production proceeds to the proper parties 
in these situations  it must be determined by the partnership whether the operator has sufficient financial resources to make such payments and distributions and to indemnify and defend the partnership in the event a third party brings a protest  action  or complaint in connection with the ultimate distribution of production proceeds by the operator 
crude oil trucking the partnership owns approximately crude oil truck unloading facilities in oklahoma  texas  and new mexico  of which approximately are located on the partnership s pipeline system and approximately are located on third party pipeline systems 
the partnership also owns and operates a one mile crude oil gathering line in new mexico  which is associated with its crude oil trucking operations there 
approximately crude oil truck drivers are employed by the partnership and approximately crude oil transport trucks are owned 
the crude oil truck drivers pick up crude oil at production lease sites and transport it to various truck unloading facilities on the partnership s pipelines and third party pipelines 
third party trucking firms are also retained to transport crude oil to certain facilities 
pipeline and terminal control operations all of the partnership s refined products and crude oil pipelines are operated via satellite  microwave  and frame relay communication systems from central control rooms located in montello  pennsylvania and tulsa  oklahoma 
the montello control center  which was moved from philadelphia during  primarily monitors and controls the partnership s eastern pipeline system  and the tulsa control center primarily monitors and controls the western pipeline system 
the montello control center  which is located at a pipeline facility located approximately miles from philadelphia  has a backup control center in philadelphia 
the nederland terminal has its own control center 
the control centers operate with modern  state of the art system control and data acquisition  or scada  systems 
the control centers are equipped with computer systems designed to continuously monitor real time operational data  including refined product and crude oil throughput  flow rates  and pressures 
in addition  the control centers monitor alarms and throughput balances 
the control centers operate remote pumps  motors  engines  and valves associated with the delivery of refined products and crude oil 
the computer systems are designed to enhance leak detection capabilities  sound automatic alarms if operational conditions outside of pre established parameters occur  and provide for remote controlled shutdown of pump stations on the partnership s pipelines 
pump stations and meter measurement points along the partnership s pipelines are linked by satellite or telephone communication systems for remote monitoring and control  which reduces the requirement for full time on site personnel at most of these locations 
acquisitions gulfmark acquisition 
on november   the partnership acquired a mile  inch bi directional crude oil pipeline and a related crude oil acquisition business from gulfmark energy  inc for million in cash 
the pipeline extends from sour lake  texas to baytown  texas and complements the existing texas gulf coast and east texas pipeline system 
wolverine  west shore and yellowstone pipe line interest acquisition 
on november   the partnership acquired an affiliate of union oil company of california  whose assets include a interest in wolverine  a joint venture that owns a mile refined product pipeline  a interest in west shore  a joint venture that owns a mile refined product pipeline  and a interest in yellowstone  a joint venture that owns a mile refined product pipeline  for million in cash 

table of contents west texas gulf pipe line interest acquisition 
on november   the partnership acquired a interest in west texas gulf  a joint venture that owns a mile crude oil pipeline  from an affiliate of sunoco  inc for million  including the issuance of  partnership common units with a fair value at the date of issuance of million 
the partnership and its equity interests are principally engaged in the transport  terminalling and storage of refined products and crude oil and in the purchasing and sale of crude oil 
although the partnership does not currently engage in business unrelated to the transportation or storage of crude oil and refined products and the other businesses described above  management of the partnership may  in the future  consider and make acquisitions in other business areas 
competition as a result of the physical integration with sunoco r m s refineries and the contractual relationship with sunoco pursuant to the omnibus agreement and sunoco r m pursuant to the pipelines and terminals storage and throughput agreement  management of the partnership believes that it will not face significant competition for crude oil transported to the philadelphia  toledo  and tulsa refineries  or refined products transported from the philadelphia  marcus hook  and toledo refineries  particularly during the term of the pipelines and terminals storage and throughput agreement with sunoco r m 
for further information on this agreement  please see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations agreements with sunoco r m and sunoco  inc for the year ended december   sunoco r m accounted for approximately of the partnership s total revenues 
eastern pipeline system nearly all of the eastern pipeline system is directly linked to sunoco r m s refineries 
sunoco r m constructed or acquired these assets as the most cost effective means to access raw materials and distribute refined products 
generally  pipelines are the lowest cost method for long haul  overland movement of refined products 
therefore  the most significant competitors for large volume shipments in the area served by the eastern pipeline system are other pipelines 
management of the partnership believes that high capital requirements  environmental considerations  and the difficulty in acquiring rights of way and related permits make it hard for other companies to build competing pipelines in areas served by the partnership s pipelines 
as a result  competing pipelines are likely to be built only in those cases in which strong market demand and attractive tariff rates support additional capacity in an area 
although it is unlikely that a pipeline system comparable in size and scope to the eastern pipeline system will be built in the foreseeable future  new pipelines including pipeline segments that connect with existing pipeline systems  such as those operated by colonial  buckeye  exxonmobil  and inland could be built to effectively compete with it in particular locations 
in addition  the partnership faces competition from trucks that deliver product in a number of areas that are served 
while their costs may not be competitive for longer hauls or large volume shipments  trucks compete effectively for incremental and marginal volume in many areas that are served 
the availability of truck transportation places a significant competitive constraint on the partnership s ability to increase tariff rates 
explorer s primary competition is the teppco pipeline  which transports petroleum products from the beaumont  port arthur and houston  texas refining centers to little rock  indianapolis  chicago  and other markets along its route  the seaway pipeline  a large diameter pipeline from houston to cushing  oklahoma  and centennial pipeline  a natural gas pipeline that was converted in into a refined products pipeline and which originates near beaumont  texas and terminates in southern illinois 
wolverine s primary competition is the buckeye pipeline from chicago  illinois to toledo  ohio and toledo to bay city  michigan  the map pipeline from chicago to grand haven  michigan  the bp pipeline from chicago to detroit  michigan  and the map refinery in detroit 

table of contents west shore s primary competition is the koch pipeline from minneapolis  minnesota to the milwaukee  wisconsin area  the bp  exxonmobil  and citgo chicago area refineries 
yellowstone s primary competition is the chevron pipeline from salt lake city  utah to spokane  washington  other modes of transportation  and the supply from seattle  washington 
terminal facilities historically  except for the nederland terminal  essentially all of the throughput at the terminal facilities has come from sunoco r m 
under the terms of the pipelines and terminals storage and throughput agreement  the partnership will continue to receive a significant portion of the throughput at these facilities from sunoco r m 
the inland refined product terminals compete with other independent terminals for price  versatility  and services provided 
the competition primarily comes from integrated petroleum companies  refining and marketing companies  independent terminal companies  and distribution companies with marketing and trading arms 
the primary competitors for the nederland terminal are its refinery customers docks and terminal facilities  and the unocal terminal and the oil tanking terminal  both located in beaumont 
management of the partnership believes the nederland terminal has superior docking capabilities and tankage facilities  and is better connected supply and distribution pipelines than these competing terminals 
the inkster terminal s primary competition comes from the marysville underground storage terminal  map s lpg storage facility in trenton  michigan and bp s facilities in st 
clair  michigan and windsor  canada 
the inkster terminal enjoys a competitive advantage with respect to volume from sunoco r m s toledo refinery due to the relatively short distance between toledo and the inkster terminal 
the partnership owns three pipelines running between toledo and the inkster terminal  which provide sunoco r m with additional flexibility 
western pipeline system the western pipeline system faces competition from a number of major oil companies and smaller entities 
pipeline competition among common carrier pipelines is based primarily on transportation charges  access to producing areas  and demand for the crude oil by end users 
management of the partnership believes that high capital costs make it unlikely for other companies to build competing crude oil pipeline systems in areas served by the western pipeline system 
crude oil purchasing and marketing competitive factors includes price and contract flexibility  quantity and quality of services  and accessibility to end markets 
the principal competitors of the western pipeline system are eott  plains all american  conocophillips  seminole trading and gathering  and teppco 
west texas gulf s primary competition is numerous pipelines originating from west texas and numerous pipelines from nederland  texas to longview  texas 
inactive assets the partnership owns approximately miles of inactive trunk lines 
of those inactive trunk lines  approximately miles are located in the oklahoma pipeline system  approximately miles are located in the west texas pipeline system and approximately miles are located in the texas gulf coast and east texas pipeline system 
management of the partnership is evaluating placing some of these pipelines back in service in the future either for the transportation of crude oil or as alternative service pipelines 

table of contents in january  the partnership idled the northern most miles of the montello  pa to syracuse  ny pipeline in the eastern pipeline system 
in addition  the partnership is seeking permission from the pa puc to idle miles of the montello to kingston  pa pipeline 
these assets were idled or are expected to be idled as a result of a long term agreement entered into by the partnership to lease throughput capacity on a third party refined product pipeline which allowed it to provide the same service as existed on the idled pipeline while reducing operating expenses 
pipeline  terminalling  and storage assets retained by sunoco sunoco has transferred to the partnership most of its pipeline  terminalling  storage  and related assets that support sunoco r m s refinery operations 
sunoco has retained the assets described below because they are either interests in crude oil pipelines that may not provide consistent revenues and cash flows or are inactive 
assets that may not provide consistent revenues and cash flows mid valley pipeline 
a subsidiary of sunoco owns a interest in the mid valley pipeline company a voting interest  which owns and operates a mile crude oil pipeline from longview  texas to samaria  michigan 
the mid valley pipeline serves a number of refineries in the midwest united states 
because of concern that the closure of one or more of these refineries could result in a material decline in the revenues and cash flows of mid valley  management of the partnership has elected not to acquire sunoco s interest in mid valley 
management believes that mid valley could be converted to a refined product pipeline and will continue to evaluate its future prospects 
mesa pipeline 
a subsidiary of sunoco owns an undivided interest in the mesa pipeline  an mile crude oil pipeline from midland  texas to colorado city 
mesa pipeline connects to west texas gulf s pipeline  which supplies crude oil to mid valley 
management of the partnership has elected not to acquire sunoco interest in this pipeline for the reasons discussed above 
inland pipeline 
a subsidiary of sunoco owns a interest in inland corporation  which owns and operates a mile refined products pipeline from lima and toledo  ohio to canton  cleveland  columbus  and dayton  ohio 
this pipeline transports refined products for sunoco r m from its toledo  ohio refinery and for the other owners 
the inland pipeline is a private intrastate pipeline that is operated at cost by the shipper owners and does not generate profits to its owners 
as a result  it was not included in the assets transferred to the partnership 
sunoco has granted the partnership a ten year option to purchase its interest in any of the preceding assets for fair market value at the date of purchase 
sunoco s interests in these assets are subject to agreements with the other interest owners that include  among other things  consent requirements and rights of first refusal that may be triggered upon certain transfers 
the exercise of the option with respect to any of these assets is subject to the terms and conditions of those agreements  which may or may not require consents or trigger rights of first refusal  depending on the facts and circumstances existing at the time of the option exercise 
on november   the partnership acquired sunoco s interest in west texas gulf pipeline 
this interest included sunoco s interest and a interest sunoco acquired from an affiliate of union oil company of california in november the partnership has no current intention to purchase the retained assets noted above 
assets that are inactive a subsidiary of sunoco owns an idled mile  inch refined product pipeline from icedale  pennsylvania to cleveland  ohio 
a subsidiary of sunoco owns various crude oil pipelines and gathering systems in louisiana  oklahoma  and texas that are no longer used because of a lack of crude oil supply 

table of contents a subsidiary of sunoco owns various refined product pipelines in the northeast and midwest that are no longer used because they are no longer economical to operate 
most of these lines have been idle for several years 
a subsidiary of sunoco owns two inactive refined product terminals in maryland and pennsylvania 
sunoco idled these terminals because they were not economical to operate 
sunoco has granted the partnership a ten year option to purchase the pipeline from icedale  pennsylvania to cleveland  ohio for fair market value at the date of purchase 
the partnership has no current intention to purchase this pipeline 
both of the ten year option agreements described above  which expire in  are contained in the omnibus agreement that was entered into with sunoco  sunoco r m and the general partner 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations agreements with sunoco r m and sunoco  inc in accordance with this agreement  if the partnership decides to exercise the option to purchase any of the assets described above  written notice must be provided to sunoco setting forth the fair market value the partnership proposes to pay for the asset 
if sunoco does not agree with the proposed fair market value  the partnership and sunoco will appoint a mutually agreed upon  nationally recognized investment banking firm to determine the fair market value of the asset 
once the investment bank submits its valuation of the asset  the partnership will have the right  but not the obligation  to purchase the asset at the price determined by the investment banking firm 
safety regulation a majority of the partnership s pipelines are subject to regulation by the united states department of transportation dot under the hazardous liquid pipeline safety act of hlpsa relating to the design  installation  testing  construction  operation  replacement and management of pipeline facilities or comparable state statutes and regulations 
the hlpsa covers petroleum and petroleum products pipelines and requires any entity that owns or operates pipeline facilities to comply with such safety regulations and to permit access to and copying of records and to make certain reports and provide information as required by the secretary of transportation 
effective in august  the dot issued its operator qualification rule  which required a written program by april  to ensure that operators were qualified to perform tasks covered by the pipeline safety rules 
the partnership identified the tasks that must be performed to comply with this rule and has developed a written program as required 
all persons performing covered tasks were qualified under the program by october  on december   the dot issued new regulations intended by the dot to assess the integrity of hazardous liquid pipeline segments that  in the event of a leak or failure  could adversely affect highly populated areas  areas unusually sensitive to environmental impact and commercially navigable waterways 
under the regulations  an operator is required  among other things  to conduct baseline integrity assessment tests such as internal inspections within seven years  conduct future integrity tests at typically five year intervals and develop and follow a written risk based integrity management program covering the designated high consequence areas 
under the rule  pipeline operators were required to identify line segments which could impact high consequence areas by december   develop baseline assessment plans for evaluating the integrity of each pipeline segment by march  and complete an assessment of the highest risk percent of line segments by september   with full assessment of the remaining percent by march  the partnership has prepared its own written risk based integrity management program  identified the line segments that could impact high consequence areas and developed baseline assessment plans 
the pipeline safety improvement act of  which was signed into law on december   includes numerous provisions that tighten federal inspection and safety requirements for natural gas and hazardous liquids pipeline facilities 
many of the statute s provisions build on existing statutory requirements and strengthen 
table of contents existing regulations of the research and special programs administration rspa and the office of pipeline safety ops  in particular  with respect to operator qualifications programs  public education programs  national mapping system  and safe excavation practices one call programs 
management of the partnership believes that compliance with the pipeline safety improvement act of will not have a material effect on its operation 
employee safety the partnership is subject to the requirements of the united states federal occupational safety and health act osha and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers 
in addition  the osha hazard communication standard requires that certain information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees  state and local authorities and citizens 
management believes that the partnership is in general compliance with osha requirements  including general industry standards  record keeping requirements and monitoring of occupational exposure to benzene 
the osha hazard communication standard  the epa community right to know regulations under title iii of the federal superfund amendment and reauthorization act  and comparable state statutes require the organization of information about the hazardous materials used in the partnership s operations 
certain parts of this information must be reported to employees  state and local governmental authorities  and local citizens upon request 
environmental regulation general the operation of pipelines  terminals  and associated facilities in connection with the storage and transportation of refined products  crude oil  and other liquid hydrocarbons are subject to stringent and complex federal  state  and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 
these laws and regulations apply to all participants in the industry  including the partnership and its equity interests 
to the extent the following discussion summarizes these laws and regulations  it is applicable to all those participants 
otherwise  the following discussion is limited to the effects of the laws and regulations on the partnership 
as with the industry generally  compliance with existing and anticipated laws and regulations increases the overall cost of business  including the capital costs to construct  maintain  and upgrade equipment and facilities 
while these laws and regulations affect maintenance capital expenditures and net income  management believes that they do not affect the partnership s competitive position in that the operations of competitors are similarly affected 
management believes that the partnership s operations are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
however  these laws and regulations are subject to frequent change by regulatory authorities  and the partnership is unable to predict the ongoing cost of complying with these laws and regulations or the future impact of these laws and regulations on operations 
violation of environmental laws  regulations  and permits can result in the imposition of significant administrative  civil and criminal penalties  injunctions  and construction bans or delays 
a discharge of hydrocarbons or hazardous substances into the environment could  to the extent the event is not insured  subject the partnership to substantial expense  including both the cost to comply with applicable laws and regulations and claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage 
under the terms of the omnibus agreement with sunoco  inc  and in connection with the contribution of assets by affiliates of sunoco  inc  sunoco  inc agreed to indemnify the partnership for years from environmental and toxic tort liabilities related to the assets transferred to the partnership that arise from the operation of such assets prior to the closing of the ipo on february  sunoco  inc is obligated to indemnify the partnership for of all such losses asserted within the first years of closing 
sunoco  inc s 
table of contents share of liability for claims asserted thereafter will decrease by a year 
for example  for a claim asserted during the twenty third year after closing  sunoco  inc would be required to indemnify the partnership for of the loss 
there is no monetary cap on the amount of indemnity coverage provided by sunoco  inc any remediation liabilities not covered by this indemnity will be the partnership s responsibility 
total future costs for environmental remediation activities will depend upon  among other things  the identification of any additional sites  the determination of the extent of the contamination at each site  the timing and nature of required remedial actions  the technology available and needed to meet the various existing legal requirements  the nature and extent of future environmental laws  inflation rates  and the determination of the partnership s liability at multi party sites  if any  in light of the number  participation levels  and financial viability of other parties 
the partnership has agreed to indemnify sunoco  inc and its affiliates for events and conditions associated with the operation of the assets that occur on or after the closing of the ipo and for environmental and toxic tort liabilities related to these assets to the extent sunoco  inc is not required to indemnify the partnership 
air emissions the partnership s operations are subject to the clean air act and comparable state and local statutes 
amendments to the clean air act enacted in late as well as recent or soon to be adopted changes to state implementation plans for controlling air emissions in regional  non attainment areas require or will require most industrial operations in the united states to incur capital expenditures in order to meet air emission control standards developed by the environmental protection agency and state environmental agencies 
as a result of these amendments  the partnership s facilities that emit volatile organic compounds or nitrogen oxides are subject to increasingly stringent regulations  including requirements that some sources install maximum or reasonably available control technology 
in addition  the clean air act amendments established a new operating permit for major sources  which applies to some of the partnership s facilities 
the partnership will be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the next several years for air pollution control equipment in connection with maintaining or obtaining permits and approvals addressing air emission related issues 
although no assurances can be given  management believes implementation of the clean air act amendments will not have a material adverse effect on the partnership s financial condition or results of operations 
the partnership s customers  including sunoco r m  are also subject to  and affected by  environmental regulations 
since the late s  the epa has undertaken significant enforcement initiatives under authority of the clean air act 
these enforcement initiatives have been targeted at industries that have large manufacturing facilities and that are significant sources of emissions  such as the refining  paper and pulp  and electric power generating industries 
the basic premise of the enforcement initiative is the epa s assertion that many of these industrial establishments have modified or expanded their operations over time without complying with new source review regulations that require permits and new emission controls in connection with any significant facility modifications or expansions that can result in emission increases above certain thresholds  and have violated various other provisions of the clean air act  including new source review and prevention of significant deterioration nsr psd programs  benzene waste organic national emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants neshap  leak detection and repair ldar and flaring requirements 
as part of this enforcement initiative  the epa has entered into consent agreements with several refiners that require them to pay civil fines and penalties and make significant capital expenditures to install emissions control equipment at selected facilities 
for some of these refineries  the cost of the required emissions control equipment is significant  depending on the size  age and configuration of the refinery 
sunoco r m received information requests in  and in connection with the enforcement initiative pertaining to its four current refineries  the puerto rico refinery divested by sunoco r m in and its phenol facility in philadelphia  pa 
sunoco r m has completed its responses to the epa  which focus solely on the refineries at this time 
sunoco r m has received notices of violation and findings of violation from the epa relating to its marcus hook  philadelphia and toledo refineries 
the notices and findings of violation allege failure to comply with certain requirements relating to benzene waste water emissions at its marcus hook  toledo and philadelphia refineries and failure to comply with certain requirements relating to leak detection and repair at the toledo refinery 
in addition  the epa has alleged that at sunoco r m s philadelphia refinery  certain 
table of contents modifications were made to one of the fluid catalytic cracking units in and without obtaining requisite permits  at sunoco r m s marcus hook refinery  certain modifications were made to the fluid catalytic cracking unit in and without obtaining requisite permits  and at its toledo refinery  certain physical and operational changes were made to the fluid catalytic cracking unit in without obtaining requisite permits 
the epa has also alleged that at sunoco r m s toledo refinery  certain physical and operational changes were made to the sulfur plant in  and without obtaining requisite permits  certain physical and operational changes were made to a flare system without obtaining requisite permits  and that the flare system was not being operated in compliance with the clean air act 
sunoco r m has met with representatives of the epa on these notices and findings of violation and is currently evaluating its position 
although sunoco r m does not believe that it has violated any clean air act requirements  as part of this initiative  sunoco r m could be required to make significant capital expenditures  operate these refineries at reduced levels and pay significant penalties 
during the session  the us congress was considering energy policy legislation 
congress failed to approve the legislation during the session 
the senate and house both approved bills  which included provisions concerning ethanol and mtbe  however  a conference committee was unable to resolve differences between the two pieces of legislation 
provisions concerning mtbe  ethanol  and fuels standards were among the disputed issues 
it is expected that these issues will be on the congressional agendas in sunoco r m uses mtbe and ethanol as an oxygenate in different geographic areas of its refining and marketing system 
while federal action to ban or phase down mtbe or to require increased usage of ethanol is uncertain  some states are scheduled to begin enforcing mtbe bans within the next year 
sunoco r m is currently evaluating its options to produce mtbe free gasoline when the additive is banned in states where it markets  including connecticut october and new york january 
while sunoco r m does not market in california  that state s ban on mtbe january could have an impact on market conditions 
numerous other states are expected to consider legislation to ban mtbe during their legislative sessions 
if mtbe is banned throughout the united states or on a state by state basis  the effect on sunoco r m and the industry in general could be significant 
it will depend on the specific regulations  the impact on gasoline supplies  the cost and availability of alternative oxygenates if the minimum oxygenate requirements remain in effect  and the ability of sunoco r m and the industry in general to recover their costs in the marketplace 
during  the epa issued its final rule addressing emissions of toxic air pollutants from mobile sources the mobile source air toxics msat rule 
the rule is currently being challenged by certain environmental organizations and a number of states  and by a member of the petroleum industry 
it requires refiners to produce gasoline which maintains their average gasoline toxic emission performance level 
if the rule survives the challenges and if mtbe is banned  it could result in significant additional expenditures or significant reductions in reformulated gasoline production levels for sunoco r m as well as the industry 
it is uncertain what sunoco  inc s or sunoco r m s responses to these emerging issues will be 
those responses could reduce sunoco r m s obligations under the pipelines and terminals storage and throughput agreement  thereby reducing the partnership s throughput in the pipelines  cash flow  and ability to make distributions or satisfy its debt obligations 
hazardous substances and waste to a large extent  the environmental laws and regulations affecting the partnership s operations relate to the release of hazardous substances or solid wastes into soils  groundwater  and surface water  and include measures to control pollution of the environment 
these laws generally regulate the generation  storage  treatment  transportation  and disposal of solid and hazardous waste 
they also require corrective action  including the investigation and remediation  of certain units at a facility where such waste may have been released or disposed 
for instance  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  referred to as cercla and also known as superfund  and comparable state laws impose liability  without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment 
these persons include the owner or operator of the site where the release 
table of contents occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances found at the site 
under cercla  these persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment  for damages to natural resources  and for the costs of certain health studies 
cercla also authorizes the epa and  in some instances  third parties to act in response to threats to the public health or the environment and to seek to recover from the responsible classes of persons the costs they incur 
it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment 
in the course of ordinary operations  the partnership may generate waste that falls within cercla s definition of a hazardous substance and  as a result  may be jointly and severally liable under cercla for all or part of the costs required to clean up sites at which these hazardous substances have been released into the environment 
costs for any such remedial actions  as well as any related claims  could have a material adverse effect on maintenance capital expenditures and operating expenses to the extent not all are covered by an indemnity from sunoco 
for more information  please see environmental remediation 
the partnership also generates solid wastes  including hazardous wastes  that are subject to the requirements of the federal resource conservation and recovery act  referred to as rcra  and comparable state statutes 
from time to time  the epa considers the adoption of stricter disposal standards for non hazardous wastes  including crude oil and gas wastes 
the partnership is not currently required to comply with a substantial portion of the rcra requirements because the operations generate minimal quantities of hazardous wastes 
however  it is possible that additional wastes  which could include wastes currently generated during operations  will in the future be designated as hazardous wastes 
hazardous wastes are subject to more rigorous and costly disposal requirements than are non hazardous wastes 
any changes in the regulations could have a material adverse effect on maintenance capital expenditures and operating expenses 
the partnership currently owns or leases  and the partnership s predecessor has in the past owned or leased  properties where hydrocarbons are being or have been handled for many years 
although operating and disposal practices have been utilized that were standard in the industry at the time  hydrocarbons or other waste may have been disposed of or released on or under the properties owned or leased by the partnership or on or under other locations where these wastes have been taken for disposal 
in addition  many of these properties have been operated by third parties whose treatment and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes was not under the partnership s control 
these properties and wastes disposed thereon may be subject to cercla  rcra  and analogous state laws 
under these laws  the partnership could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators  to clean up contaminated property including contaminated groundwater  or to perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination 
the partnership has not been identified by any state or federal agency as a prp in connection with the transport and or disposal of any waste products to third party disposal sites 
water the partnership s operations can result in the discharge of pollutants  including crude oil 
the oil pollution act was enacted in and amends provisions of the water pollution control act of and other statutes as they pertain to prevention and response to oil spills 
the oil pollution act subjects owners of covered facilities to strict  joint  and potentially unlimited liability for removal costs and other consequences of an oil spill  where the spill is into navigable waters  along shorelines or in the exclusive economic zone of the united states 
in the event of an oil spill into navigable waters  substantial liabilities could be imposed upon the partnership 
states in which the partnership operates have also enacted similar laws 
regulations are currently being developed under the oil pollution act and state laws that may also impose additional regulatory burdens on the partnership s operations 
spill prevention control and countermeasure requirements of federal laws and some state laws require diking and similar structures to help prevent contamination of navigable waters in the event of an oil overflow  rupture  or leak 
the partnership is in substantial compliance with these laws 
additionally  the office of pipeline safety of the dot has approved the partnership s oil spill emergency response plans 

table of contents the water pollution control act of imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of pollutants into navigable waters 
permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants into state and federal waters 
the water pollution control act of imposes substantial potential liability for the costs of removal  remediation  and damages 
in addition  some states maintain groundwater protection programs that require permits for discharges or operations that may impact groundwater conditions 
management believes that compliance with existing permits and compliance with foreseeable new permit requirements will not have a material adverse effect on the partnership s financial condition or results of operations 
endangered species act the endangered species act restricts activities that may affect endangered species or their habitats 
while some of the partnership s facilities are in areas that may be designated as habitat for endangered species  management believes that the partnership is in substantial compliance with the endangered species act 
however  the discovery of previously unidentified endangered species could cause the partnership to incur additional costs or become subject to operating restrictions or bans in the affected area 
environmental remediation contamination resulting from spills of refined products and crude oil is not unusual within the petroleum pipeline industry 
historic spills along the partnership s pipelines  gathering systems  and terminals as a result of past operations have resulted in contamination of the environment  including soils and groundwater 
site conditions  including soils and groundwater  are being evaluated at a number of properties where operations may have resulted in releases of hydrocarbons and other wastes 
sunoco has agreed to indemnify the partnership from environmental and toxic tort liabilities related to the assets transferred to the extent such liabilities exist or arise from operation of these assets prior to the closing of the ipo and are asserted within years after the closing of the ipo 
this indemnity will cover the costs associated with performance of the assessment  monitoring  and remediation programs  as well as any related claims and penalties 
see environmental regulation general 
the partnership has experienced several petroleum releases for which it is not covered by an indemnity from sunoco  inc  and is therefore the responsible party and needs to perform the necessary assessment  remediation  and or monitoring activities 
remediation programs may be mandated at two sites  one in texas and one in pennsylvania 
management estimates that the total aggregate cost of performing the currently anticipated assessment  monitoring  and remediation activities at these two sites is not material to the partnership at december  the partnership has implemented an extensive inspection program to prevent releases of refined products or crude oil into the environment from its pipelines  gathering systems  and terminals 
any damages and liabilities incurred due to future environmental releases from the partnership s assets have the potential to substantially affect its business 
rate regulation general interstate regulation 
interstate common carrier pipeline operations are subject to rate regulation by the ferc under the interstate commerce act 
the interstate commerce act requires that tariff rates for oil pipelines  a category that includes crude oil  petroleum products  and petrochemical pipelines crude oil  petroleum product  and petrochemical pipelines are referred to collectively as petroleum pipelines  be just and reasonable and not unduly discriminatory 
the interstate commerce act permits challenges to proposed new or changed rates by protest  and challenges to rates that are already on file and in effect by complaint 
upon the appropriate showing  a successful complainant may obtain damages or reparations for generally up to two years prior to the filing of a complaint 

table of contents the ferc is authorized to suspend the effectiveness of a new or changed tariff rate for a period of up to seven months and to investigate the rate 
if upon the completion of an investigation the ferc finds that the rate is unlawful  it may require the pipeline operator to refund to shippers  with interest  any difference between the rates the ferc determines to be lawful and the rates under investigation 
the ferc will order the pipeline to change its rates prospectively to the lawful level 
index based rates and other subsequent developments 
in october  congress passed the energy policy act of the energy policy act deemed interstate petroleum pipeline rates in effect for the day period ending on the date of enactment of the energy policy act  or that were in effect on the th day preceding enactment and had not been subject to complaint  protest  or investigation during the day period  to be just and reasonable under the interstate commerce act 
these rates are commonly referred to as grandfathered rates 
all of the partnership s interstate pipeline rates were deemed just and reasonable and therefore are grandfathered under the energy policy act 
the energy policy act provides that the ferc may change grandfathered rates upon complaints only under the following limited circumstances a substantial change has occurred since enactment in either the economic circumstances or the nature of the services that were a basis for the rate  the complainant was contractually barred from challenging the rate prior to enactment of the energy policy act and filed the complaint within days of the expiration of the contractual bar  or a provision of the tariff is unduly discriminatory or preferential 
the energy policy act further required the ferc to issue rules establishing a simplified and generally applicable ratemaking methodology for interstate petroleum pipelines and to streamline procedures in petroleum pipeline proceedings 
on october   the ferc responded to the energy policy act directive by issuing order no 
 which adopted a new indexed rate methodology for interstate petroleum pipelines 
under the resulting regulations  effective january   petroleum pipelines were able to change their rates within prescribed ceiling levels that were tied to changes in the producer price index for finished goods  minus one percent ppi 
rate increases made under the index are subject to protest  but the scope of the protest proceeding will be limited to an inquiry into whether the portion of the rate increase resulting from application of the index is substantially in excess of the pipeline s increase in costs 
the indexing methodology is applicable to any existing rate  whether grandfathered or whether established after enactment of the energy policy act 
in december  the ferc concluded that the ppi index should be continued for another five year period 
however  the us court of appeals for the district of columbia found the decision to be flawed in certain respects and remanded the matter to the ferc for further consideration 
on february   the ferc issued its order on remand 
the commission concluded that the appropriate index for the current five year period should be the ppi without the minus one percent adjustment 
it further ruled that pipelines may calculate the current ceiling rate using the ppi as though it had been the index in effect since july  in order no 
 the ferc said that as a general rule pipelines must utilize the indexing methodology to change their rates 
indexing includes the requirement that  in any year in which the index is negative  pipelines must file to lower their rates if they would otherwise be above the reduced ceiling 
however  the pipeline is not required to reduce its rates below the level deemed just and reasonable under the energy policy act 
the ferc further indicated in order no 
 however  that it is retaining cost of service ratemaking  market based rates  and settlement rates as alternatives to the indexing approach 
a pipeline can follow a cost of service approach when seeking to increase its rates above index levels or when seeking to avoid lowering rates to index levels provided that the pipeline can establish that there is a substantial divergence between the actual cost increases or decreases experienced by the pipeline and the rate resulting from application of the index 
a pipeline can charge market based rates if it establishes that it lacks significant market power in the affected markets 
in addition  a pipeline can establish rates under settlement if agreed upon by all current shippers 
as specified in order and subsequent decisions  a pipeline can seek to establish initial rates for new services through a cost of service showing  by establishing in advance that it lacks significant market power in the affected markets  or through an 
table of contents agreement between the pipeline and at least one shipper not affiliated with the pipeline who intends to use the new service 
another development affecting petroleum pipeline ratemaking arose in opinion no 
 involving a partnership operating a crude oil pipeline 
in opinion no 
 the ferc concluded that there should not be a corporate income tax allowance built into a petroleum pipeline s rates for income attributable to noncorporate partners because those partners  unlike corporate partners  do not pay a corporate income tax on partnership distributions 
opinion no 
was affirmed by the ferc on rehearing in may the parties subsequently settled the case  so no judicial review of the tax ruling took place 
a current proceeding  however  is pending at the ferc that could result in changes to the ferc s income tax method announced in opinion no 
as well as to other elements of the ferc s rate methods for petroleum pipelines 
this proceeding involves another publicly traded limited partnership engaged in petroleum products pipeline transportation 
in january   the ferc issued opinion no 
in this proceeding  which  among other things  affirmed opinion no 
s determination that there should not be a corporate income tax allowance built into a petroleum pipeline s rates for income attributable to noncorporate partners 
in subsequent decisions on rehearing  the ferc further defined the scope of the income tax allowance for publicly traded limited partnerships  and resolved a number of other cost of service issues as well 
market based rates 
in a proceeding involving buckeye pipeline company  lp  the ferc found that a petroleum pipeline able to demonstrate a lack of market power may be allowed a lighter standard of regulation than that imposed by the trended original cost methodology 
in such a case  the pipeline company has the opportunity to establish that it faces sufficient competition to justify relief from the strict application of the cost based principles 
in buckeye  the ferc determined  based on the existing level of market concentration in the pipeline s market areas  that buckeye exercised significant market power in only five of its market areas and therefore was entitled to charge market based rates in the other market areas 
the opportunity to charge market based rates means that the pipeline may charge what the market will bear 
order no 
 a companion order to order no 
 was issued by the ferc on october  and established procedural rules governing petroleum pipelines applications for a finding that the pipeline lacks significant market power in the relevant market 
settlement rates 
in order no 
 the ferc specifically held that it would also permit changes in rates that are the product of unanimous agreement between the pipeline and all the shippers using the service to which the rate applies 
the rationale behind allowing this type of rate change is to further the ferc s policy of favoring settlements among parties and to lessen the regulatory burdens on all concerned 
the ferc  however  will also entertain a challenge to settlement rates  in response to a protest or a complaint that alleges the same circumstances required to challenge an indexed rate 
an example of this type of challenge is that there is a discrepancy between the rate and the pipeline s cost of service that is so substantial as to render the settlement or indexed rate unjust and unreasonable 
intrastate regulation 
some of the partnership s pipeline operations are subject to regulation by the texas railroad commission  the pa puc  the ohio public utility commission  and the oklahoma corporation commission 
the applicable state statutes require that pipeline rates be nondiscriminatory and provide no more than a fair return on the aggregate value of the pipeline property used to render services 
state commissions have generally not been aggressive in regulating common carrier pipelines and have generally not investigated the rates or practices of petroleum pipelines in the absence of shipper complaints 
complaints to state agencies have been infrequent and are usually resolved informally 
although management cannot be certain that the partnership s intrastate rates would ultimately be upheld if challenged  management believes that  given this history  the tariffs now in effect are not likely to be challenged or  if challenged  are not likely to be ordered to be reduced 
the partnership s pipelines 
the ferc generally has not investigated interstate rates on its own initiative when those rates  like the partnership s  have not been the subject of a protest or a complaint by a shipper 
in 
table of contents addition  as discussed above  intrastate pipelines generally are subject to light handed regulation by state commissions and management of the partnership does not believe the intrastate tariffs now in effect are likely to be challenged 
however  the ferc or a state regulatory commission could investigate the partnership s rates at the urging of a third party if the third party is either a current shipper or is able to show that it has a substantial economic interest in the tariff rate level 
if an intrastate rate were challenged  the partnership would defend it on a cost of service basis 
if an interstate rate were challenged  that rate would be defended as grandfathered under the energy policy act 
as that act applies to the partnership s rates  a person challenging a grandfathered rate must  as a threshold matter  establish a substantial change since the date of enactment of the act  in either the economic circumstances or the nature of the service that formed the basis for the rate 
a complainant might assert that the creation of the partnership itself constitutes such a change  an argument that has not previously been specifically addressed by the ferc and to which management believes there are valid defenses 
if the ferc were to find a substantial change in circumstances  then the existing rates could be subject to detailed review 
management believes that most such rates can be supported on a cost of service basis  even recognizing the reduction in the income tax allowance that is likely to result from the conversion from a corporation to a partnership 
although there are some rates that might not be defensible on that basis  management believes that all of those rates involve movements as to which sunoco r m is the only shipper  the partnership has a reasonable basis to assert the lack of significant market power and therefore are entitled to market based rates  or the revenue amounts involved do not materially affect the partnership s performance 
if the ferc investigated the partnership s rate levels  it could inquire into the costs  including the overall cost of service  including operating costs and overhead  the allocation of overhead and other administrative and general expenses to the rate  the appropriate capital structure to be utilized in calculating rates  the appropriate rate of return on equity  the rate base  including the proper starting rate base  the throughput underlying the rate  and the proper allowance for federal and state income taxes 
management of the partnership does not believe that it is likely that there will be a rate challenge by a current shipper that would materially affect revenues or cash flows 
sunoco r m and its subsidiaries are the only current shippers in many of the pipelines 
sunoco r m has agreed not to challenge  or to cause others to challenge or assist others in challenging  the tariff rates for the term of the pipelines and terminals storage and throughput agreement 
because most of the pipelines are common carrier pipelines  the partnership may be required to accept new shippers who wish to transport in the pipelines 
it is possible that any new shippers  current shippers  or other interested parties  may decide to challenge the tariff rates 
if any rate challenge or challenges were successful  the cash available for distribution could be materially reduced 
title to properties substantially all of the pipelines were constructed on rights of way granted by the apparent record owners of the property and in some instances these rights of way are revocable at the election of the grantor 
several rights of way for the pipelines and other real property assets are shared with other pipelines and other assets owned by affiliates of sunoco  inc and by third parties 
in many instances  lands over which rights of way have been obtained are subject to prior liens that have not been subordinated to the right of way grants 
the partnership has obtained permits from public authorities to cross over or under  or to lay facilities in or along  watercourses  county roads  municipal streets  and state highways and  in some instances  these permits are revocable at the election of the grantor 
the partnership has also obtained permits from railroad companies to 
table of contents cross over or under lands or rights of way  many of which are also revocable at the grantor s election 
in some cases  property for pipeline purposes was purchased in fee 
in some states and under some circumstances  the partnership has the right of eminent domain to acquire rights of way and lands necessary for the common carrier pipelines 
the previous owners of the applicable pipelines may not have commenced or concluded eminent domain proceedings for some rights of way 
some of the leases  easements  rights of way  permits  and licenses transferred to the partnership upon the completion of the ipo in february required the consent of the grantor to transfer these rights  which in some instances is a governmental entity 
the partnership has obtained or is in the process of obtaining third party consents  permits  and authorizations sufficient for the transfer of the assets necessary to operate the business in all material respects 
with respect to any consents  permits  or authorizations that have not been obtained  the failure to obtain these consents  permits  or authorizations will have no material adverse effect on the operation of the business 
the partnership has satisfactory title to all of the assets  or is entitled to indemnification from sunoco  inc under the omnibus agreement for title defects to the assets contributed to the partnership and for failures to obtain certain consents and permits necessary to conduct the business that arise within ten years after the closing of the ipo 
record title to some of the assets may continue to be held by affiliates of sunoco  inc until the partnership has made the appropriate filings in the jurisdictions in which such assets are located and obtained any consents and approvals that were not obtained prior to the closing of the ipo 
although title to these properties is subject to encumbrances in some cases  such as customary interests generally retained in connection with acquisition of real property  liens that can be imposed in some jurisdictions for government initiated action to clean up environmental contamination  liens for current taxes and other burdens  and easements  restrictions  and other encumbrances to which the underlying properties were subject at the time of acquisition by the predecessor or the partnership  none of these burdens should materially detract from the value of these properties or from the partnership s interest in these properties or should materially interfere with their use in the operation of the business 
employees to carry out the partnership s operations  the general partner and its affiliates employ approximately  people who provide direct support to the operations 
labor unions or associations represent approximately of these employees 
the general partner considers its employee relations to be good 
the partnership has no employees

the partnership distributes all cash on hand within days after the end of each quarter  less reserves established by the general partner in its discretion 
this is defined as available cash in the partnership agreement 
the general partner has broad discretion to establish cash reserves that it determines are necessary or appropriate to properly conduct the partnership s business 
the partnership will make minimum quarterly distributions of per common unit  to the extent there is sufficient cash from operations after establishment of cash reserves and payment of fees and expenses  including payments to the general partner
