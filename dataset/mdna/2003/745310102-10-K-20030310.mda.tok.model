the following information pertains to the changes outlined in the table above puget sound energy compared to operating revenues electric electric operating revenues decreased million in compared to due primarily to a decrease of million in wholesale electric sales to other utilities and marketers due to lower surplus volumes and substantially lower prices in the wholesale electricity market 
wholesale sales volumes decreased by billion kwh or 
retail sales revenue decreased primarily as a result of industrial and commercial customers on market index rates switching to transportation rate tariffs beginning in july  as allowed by a washington commission order dated april   authorizing the establishment of a new electric transportation rate tariff 
the decrease was offset by an interim electric rate surcharge in effect during the period april  through june   which increased electric revenue by million and a electric general rate increase effective july   which increased electric revenue by approximately million in transportation revenues increased million and volume increased billion kwh in to meet customer demand  pse dispatches resources in its power supply portfolio such as fossil fuel generation  owned and contracted hydro capacity and energy  and long term contracted power 
however  depending principally upon availability of hydroelectric energy  plant availability  fuel prices and or changing load as a result of weather  pse may sell surplus power or purchase deficit power in the wholesale market 
pse manages its core energy portfolio through short and intermediate term off system physical purchases and sales  and through other risk management techniques 
pse s risk management committee oversees energy price risk matters 
pse operates its combustion turbine plants located in western washington primarily as peaking plants when it is cost effective to do so 
during  pse had operated its combustion turbine plants extensively to meet both on system and regional load requirements largely due to adverse hydroelectric conditions in the pacific northwest 
for  pse did not operate the combustion turbines to the extent it did in since market prices did not support the dispatching of these units  and pse could serve its customers with lower cost resources 
as a result  sales to other utilities and marketers declined in due to low wholesale energy prices and the reduction in operations of the combustion turbines 
on june   the washington commission approved and adopted the settlement stipulation in the general rate case  putting new rates into effect on july  pse established a pca mechanism in the rate case settlement 
the pca mechanism will account for differences in pse s modified actual power costs relative to a power cost baseline 
the mechanism would account for a sharing of costs and benefits that are graduated over four levels of power cost variances  with an overall cap of million over the four year period july  through june  pse s share of the cost through december  was million 
the factors influencing the variability of power costs included in the proposal are primarily weather or market related 
pse will be allowed to file for rate increases to implement limited power supply cost increases related to new resources 
on june   the washington commission approved an amended residential purchase and sale agreement between pse and the bpa  under which pse s residential and small farm customers would continue to receive benefits of federal power 
completion of this agreement enabled pse to continue to provide  and in fact increase  effective january   the residential and farm energy exchange credit to residential and small farm customers 
the amended settlement agreement provides that  for its residential and small farm customers  pse will receive a cash payment benefits during the period july  through september  and b benefits in the form of power or cash payments during the period october  through september  on june  pse entered into an agreement with the bpa which amended the payment provisions of the amended settlement agreement to provide for conditional deferral of payment by bpa of certain amounts to be paid under the original agreement 
to implement this agreement for rate purposes  the washington commission approved tariff revisions that were intended a to transfer the residential and farm energy exchange credit in effect since october  in the amount of per kwh  to general rates effective july  and b to provide a supplemental residential and farm exchange credit for eligible residential and small farm customers 
on june   the washington commission then transferred the portion of the credit that had been in general rates back into schedule the residential and farm exchange benefit supplemental rider schedule was retitled residential and farm energy exchange benefit  the portion of the credit that had been in general rates was transferred back into schedule  and the credit was set at per kwh for the period july  through september   per kwh for the period october  through may  and per kwh for the period june  through september  the approval of these revised tariffs by the washington commission was effective july  in january  pse filed tariff sheets with the washington commission to reflect a modification to the agreement between pse and the bpa that would reduce the residential and farm energy exchange benefit credit 
under the modified agreement  bpa will defer paying a portion of the benefits it would have otherwise paid 
the amount of benefits deferred will be million each month for the eight month period beginning february  for a total deferral of million 
contemporaneously with entering into this agreement with pse  bpa is entering into other agreements similar to the agreement with pse through which other investor owned utilities and bpa are agreeing to bpa s deferral of payments in their fiscal year the total cumulative amount to be deferred under the agreement with pse and other such agreements equals million  an amount that will help bpa address its current financial difficulties 
absent certain adjustments  bpa will begin paying back the amount deferred with interest over the sixty month period beginning november the washington commission approved the tariff changes and the rider credit was changed to for the period february  through september  bpa s rate case may affect the level of residential exchange benefits for pse s customers 
for  the benefits of the residential and farm energy exchange credited to customers were million with a related offset to power costs 
pse received payments from bpa in the amount of million during the difference between the customers credit and the amount received from bpa is deferred and will be credited to customers in later periods 
the difference is recorded on pse s balance sheet as restricted cash 
the modified agreement will provide for payments from bpa in the amount of million for the period january through september and for pass through to eligible residential and farm customers of the same amount 
there are several actions in the ninth circuit court of appeals against bpa  in which the petitioners assert that bpa acted contrary to law or without authority in deciding to enter into  or in entering into or performing  a number of contracts  including the contract between bpa and the company described above 
bpa rates used in such contract between bpa and the company for determining the amounts of money to be paid to the company during the period october  through september  have been confirmed  approved and allowed to go into effect by ferc on an interim basis  subject to refund with interest 
it is not clear what impact  if any  review of such rates and the above described ninth circuit court of appeals actions may have on the company 
in  pse collected and remitted to a grantor trust million as a result of pse s sale of future electric revenues associated with its investment in conservation assets in its electric general rate tariff 
the impact of the sale of revenue was offset by reductions in conservation amortization and interest expenses 
the principal amounts owed by the trust to its bondholders was million december  operating revenues gas regulated gas utility revenues in compared to decreased by million due primarily to pga rate decreases  as a result of lower natural gas prices that are passed through to customers 
gas delivered for transportation customers increased million or million therms in on august   the washington commission approved a decrease in pse s natural gas rates of due to lower natural gas costs purchased for customers under terms of the pga mechanism effective september  also  on may   the washington commission allowed a decrease in pga rates of to become effective on june  this ended a temporary surcharge that went into effect september  the pga mechanism passes through to customers increases or decreases in the gas supply portion of the natural gas service rates based upon changes in the price of natural gas purchased from producers and wholesale marketers or changes in gas pipeline transportation costs 
pse s gas margin and net income are not affected by changes under the pga 
on august   the washington commission approved a gas service rate increase in revenue to cover higher costs of providing natural gas service to customers 
this service related increase in revenues of approximately million annually was offset by an annual million or pga rate reduction  also approved on august  both rate actions became effective september  on september   pse filed a proposal with the washington commission to reduce natural gas supply rates under the pga for a third time in the washington commission approved the proposal on october  and pse lowered gas rates through the pga by approximately effective november  other revenues other operating revenues decreased million primarily due to a million decrease in the gross margin on property sales from pse s real estate investment and development subsidiary  puget western  inc operating expenses purchased electricity expenses decreased million in compared to due to the dramatic decline of wholesale electricity prices since june and an day unplanned outage of one of pse s mw combustion turbine electric generating units located at its fredonia generating station from february  to may   resulting in higher purchased electricity costs during in addition  the historic low hydroelectric power generation conditions experienced in in a high priced wholesale market forced pse to purchase additional energy during that period to meet retail electric customer loads 
pse s hydroelectric production and related power costs in are expected to be impacted negatively by drought conditions in the pacific northwest region associated with el nino weather conditions 
the northwest rivers forecast center on february  predicted that streamflows in the columbia river basin above grand coulee dam would be only percent of normal 
in a normal water year  pse obtains about percent of its energy supply from low cost hydroelectric facilities  primarily from dams below grand coulee on the columbia river 
if the forecasted streamflow reductions occur  pse will need to replace that low cost hydropower with more expensive thermally generated and purchased power 
pse s share of the power costs through december  was million 
because of adverse hydro conditions in  pse anticipates reaching the million cumulative cap under the pca mechanism by the frouth quarter of under the pca mechanism  further increases in variable power costs through june  would be apportioned to cutomers and to pse 
residential exchange credits associated with the residential purchase and sale agreement with bpa increased million in compared to due to the amended residential purchase and sale agreement between pse and bpa as discussed in operating revenues electric reflecting increased benefits passed on to residential and small farm customers 
as of july  all residential exchange credits are passed through to eligible residential and small farm customers by a corresponding reduction in revenues 
purchased gas expenses decreased million in compared to primarily due to the impact of decreased gas costs  which are passed through to customers through the pga mechanism  offset by a increase in sales volumes 
the pga allows pse to recover expected gas costs 
pse defers  as a receivable or liability  any gas costs that exceed or fall short of the amount in pga rates and accrues interest under the pga 
the pga balance was a receivable at december  of million while the balance at december  was a liability of million 
electric generation fuel expense decreased million in compared to as a result of decreased generation costs at pse controlled combustion turbine facilities and lower wholesale energy prices 
these facilities operated at much higher levels during compared to to meet retail electric customer loads due to adverse hydroelectric conditions in unrealized gains losses on derivative instruments during resulted in a decrease in expense of million pre tax million after tax 
the unrealized gains and losses recorded in the income statement are the result of the change in the market value of derivative instruments not meeting cash flow hedge criteria 
in addition  sfas was adopted on january   and as a result  a one time million after tax transition loss was recorded in from recognizing the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle 
for further discussion see note production operations and maintenance costs increased million in compared to due primarily to a million pre tax charge related to an industrial accident at colstrip units and  of which pse is a owner  overall higher operating costs for the colstrip generating facilities and the settlement of a combustion turbine insurance claim 
pse s personal energy management tm energy efficiency program costs decreased million in compared to  reflecting a decreased emphasis on the program in light of relatively moderate energy prices and cancellation of the time of use program in november a new low income program approved by the washington commission in the general rate case settlement began in july which resulted in increased costs of million in compared to these costs are fully recovered in retail rates beginning at the program s inception on july  for electric and september  for gas 
other utility operations and maintenance costs increased million in compared to due primarily to higher expense related to a one time pse employee severance cost totaling million related to strategic outsourcing of operations work to service providers  and an overall increase in administrative and meter reading expenses 
also included in the results is pension income related to pse s defined benefit pension plan for sfas no 
employers accounting for pensions 
pension and benefit costs are allocated between capital and operations and maintenance expenses based on the distribution of labor costs in accordance with ferc accounting instructions 
as a result  approximately of the annual qualified pension income of million for was recorded as a reduction in operation and maintenance expense compared to of million for qualified pension income is expected to decline to million in as a result of lower actual returns on pension assets during the last three years and declining expected rates of return on pension fund assets 
pse s other operations and maintenance expenses decreased million in compared to primarily due to a decrease in operating expenses at connext  the assets of which were sold in the third quarter of depreciation and amortization expense increased million in compared to  of which million is due primarily to the effects of additional plant placed into service at pse during conservation amortization increased million in compared to due to increased conservation expenditures 
these costs are recovered in conservation rider and tracker mechanisms with no impact to earnings 
taxes other than income taxes increased million  of which pse s decreased million in compared to due primarily to a decrease in revenue based washington state excise tax and municipal tax 
this is offset by a municipal tax expense of million recorded in related to various claims by cities that pse underpaid municipal taxes owed as a result of not collecting the tax in certain rural areas that were annexed by cities 
the offset also includes a one time property tax expense of million covering a six year period ending june   related to state of oregon property tax bills on pse s long term third ac transmission intertie contract 
income taxes decreased million in compared to  of which pse s income taxes decreased by million 
the decrease in includes a total of million in one time refunds at pse of which million was recorded in the second quarter of related to the audit of the company s and federal income tax returns 
of this amount  million reduced current tax expense and the balance  million  was recorded as a deferred income tax liability 
the decrease at pse also includes a million reduction to expense representing an adjustment to federal income tax based on the federal tax return filed in the third quarter of the decrease in also includes flow through benefits reducing federal income taxes of million recorded in the fourth quarter of related to a refund of federal income taxes for other income other income  net of federal income tax  decreased million in compared to due primarily to a one time million after tax gain realized by pse on the sale of connext s assets in the third quarter of interest charges interest charges  which consist of interest and amortization on long term debt and other interest  increased million in compared to of which pse s increased million as a result primarily of a full year s interest expense on the issuance of million trust preferred securities in may other interest expense increased due primarily to a pga liability over recovery of gas costs in rates in compared to a pga asset under recovery of gas costs in rates in under the pga mechanism  interest is accrued on deferred balances 
infrastrux compared to infrastrux revenue increased million in compared to due primarily to acquisitions of several companies during and  which contributed to an increase of million 
excluding the impact of acquisitions  infrastrux revenue increased million from and was impacted positively by ice storm restoration work performed in oklahoma by infrastrux s texas companies and continued strong performance of remediation services in the utility industry 
infrastrux records revenues as services are performed or on a percent of completion basis for fixed price projects 
infrastrux operation and maintenance expenses increased million in compared to primarily due to acquisitions during and  which contributed to an increase of million 
excluding the impact of acquisitions  infrastrux operation and maintenance expenses increased million from and were impacted by the increase of corporate infrastructure to support a growing organization  additional costs of direct wages  construction costs and higher insurance costs incurred to support an increased revenue base 
depreciation and amortization increased by million in compared to due to acquisitions during and  which contributed million 
increases in depreciation of million from core companies were due primarily to the acquisition of strategic assets to support areas of the company where significant growth opportunities exist 
taxes other than income taxes increased million in compared to primarily due to a million increase in payroll tax resulting from an increased workforce as acquisitions have been completed 
income taxes increased million in compared to due primarily to the acquisition of companies acquired during and acquired companies accounted for an increase of million offset by a reduction in the effective tax rate due to certain non deductible or partially deductible items 
interest charges increased million in compared to due to an increase in the amount drawn on its revolving credit facilities primarily used for funding acquisitions 
other income increased million in compared to due primarily to implementation of sfas no 
which ceased amortization of goodwill 
goodwill amortization expense in was million 
puget sound energy compared to operating revenues electric electric operating revenues decreased million in compared to due to an overall average general rate increase effective january  offset by sales to other utilities and marketers which decreased million in due primarily to lower wholesale power volumes of billion kwh and lower surplus capacity 
electric revenues in decreased due to lower regulated sales to customers  decreased prices and kilowatt hours sold related to electric energy sales to other utilities and marketers and lower prices on market index sales 
this latter group of customers can choose another supplier or self generate their energy needs 
several index rate customers switched to transportation rate tariffs beginning in july as allowed by a washington commission order dated april  authorizing the establishment of a transportation tariff 
on june   ferc implemented price controls on wholesale electricity in the western states 
several factors contributed to the dramatic decline in wholesale electric prices by the end of the second quarter of and  therefore  greatly diminished the value of pse s excess electric energy during that period and into the foreseeable future 
pse and other western utilities filed an appeal asking ferc to review its june  order and make modifications to the price controls to stabilize wholesale prices in california and prevent the energy problems from spreading to other states 
on december   ferc issued an order on clarification and rehearing addressing  in part  pse s petition for rehearing on the june  order 
pse and other entities have sought further rehearing and clarification of the december  order 
electric revenues were reduced by approximately million in compared to related to a customer conservation incentive credit which was approved by the washington commission on april  the conservation incentive credit was to reduce customers bills by per kwh for each kwh reduction in excess of from the same billing period in the prior year through december  on november   the washington commission approved pse s request to terminate the conservation incentive credit program effective november  revenues from electric customers in were reduced by a residential and farm energy exchange credit tariff in place since october  under the rate plan approved by the washington commission in its merger order  pse reflected in customers bills the level of residential exchange benefits in place at the time of the merger with washington energy company in on january   pse and bpa signed an agreement under which pse received payments from bpa of approximately million over an approximate five year period that ended june these payments were recorded as a reduction of purchased electricity expenses 
as a result of lower usage by residential and farm customers in  the residential and farm exchange credit decreased by million as compared to for calendar  the benefits of the residential and farm energy exchange credited to customers was million as compared to an offsetting reduction in purchased electricity expense of million 
eligible residential and small farm customers received credits to their bills in the same amount 
in  pse collected and remitted to two grantor trusts million as a result of pse s sale of future electric revenues associated with its investment in conservation assets in its electric general rate tariff 
the impact of the sale of revenue was offset by reductions in conservation amortization and interest expenses 
the principal amounts owed by the trusts to its bondholders were million at december  on april   the washington commission issued an order allowing pse s large industrial customers whose rates were linked to a market index to choose their supplier of electricity or to self generate 
if an industrial customer chooses an alternate supplier  pse will provide the transportation of electricity to the customer s premises and charge that customer for the service 
operating revenues gas regulated gas utility sales revenue in compared to increased by million from the prior year due primarily to higher natural gas prices which are passed through to customers in the pga 
total gas volumes  including transported gas  decreased in from transportation and other revenue decreased million or million therms as industrial customers curtailed usage due to higher natural gas prices and water heater rental revenue declined 
other revenues other revenues increased million in compared to due primarily to increased gross margins on property sales at pse s real estate investment and development subsidiary puget western  inc operating expenses purchased electricity expenses decreased million in compared to the decrease in was due primarily to lower volumes and significantly lower prices for non firm power purchases from other utilities and marketers due to declining prices in the west coast power market beginning in the second half of residential exchange credits associated with the residential purchase and sale agreement with bpa increased million in compared to due to the terms set out in the residential exchange termination agreement and the residential purchase and sale agreement between pse and bpa discussed in operating revenues electric 
beginning july  all residential exchange credits are passed through to eligible residential and small farm customers by a corresponding reduction in revenues 
purchased gas expenses increased million in compared to primarily due to the impact of increased gas costs  which are passed through to customers through the pga mechanism  offset by a decrease in sales volumes 
electric generation fuel expense increased million in compared to as a result of increased generation and higher fuel costs at combustion turbine facilities 
these facilities operated at much higher levels in compared to the same period in due to adverse hydroelectric conditions 
unrealized gains losses on derivative instruments during  an increase to operating earnings of approximately million pre tax million after tax was recognized for unrealized gains associated with electric derivative transactions and a million after tax transition adjustment loss was recorded from recognizing the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle 
for further discussion see note production operations and maintenance costs increased million in compared to due primarily to an approximately million increase in lease costs associated with pse s fredonia and electric generation units offset by reduced operating costs resulting from the sale of the centralia generating station in may and a net cost of million after estimated insurance recovery to repair the pse owned fredonia combustion turbine unit  which was out of service from february  through may  pse s personal energy management tm energy efficiency program costs increased million in  reflecting a full year of implementation compared to pse began providing personal energy managementtm billing information to electric customers in december other utility operations and maintenance costs increased million in compared to due primarily to repair costs associated with storm and earthquake damage in  increased meter reading expenses associated with providing personal energy managementtm  and a one time insurance recovery received in pse s other operations and maintenance expenses decreased million in compared to primarily due to a decrease in operating expenses at connext  the assets of which were sold in the third quarter of depreciation and amortization expenses increased million in compared to due to the effects of new plant placed into service during  including consumerlinx  a customer information and billing system  which was placed into service in phases through late and early taxes other than income taxes increased million in of which million was attributed to pse as a result of increases in municipal taxes and state excise taxes that are revenue based

the receivables securitization facility is the functional equivalent of a secured revolving line of credit 
in the event rainier receivables elects to sell receivables under the receivables purchase agreement  rainier receivables is required to pay the purchasers of the receivables fees that are analogous to interest on a revolving line of credit 
as receivables are collected by pse as agent for the receivables purchasers  the outstanding amount of receivables purchased by the purchasers declines until rainier receivables elects to sell additional receivables to the purchasers 
the receivables securitization facility has a three year term  but is terminable by pse and rainier receivables upon notice to the receivables purchasers 
at december  there were no amounts outstanding under the accounts receivable securitization facility 
fredonia and operating lease in april  pse revised its master operating lease to million plus interest with a financial institution 
under this revised agreement pse leases two combustion turbines for its fredonia and electric generation facility 
the lease has a term expiring in  but can be cancelled by pse after three years 
payments under the lease vary with changes in the london inter bank offered rate libor 
at december   pse s outstanding balance under the lease was million 
lease payments assume a libor of 
the expected residual value under the lease is the lesser of million or of the cost of the equipment 
in the event the equipment is sold to a third party upon termination of the lease and the aggregate sales proceeds are less than of the unamortized value of the equipment  pse would be required to pay the lessor an amount equal to the deficiency 
utility construction program current utility construction expenditures for generation  transmission and distribution are designed to meet continuing customer growth and to improve efficiencies of pse s energy delivery systems 
construction expenditures  excluding equity allowance for funds used during construction afudc  were million in pse expects construction expenditures will be approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
construction expenditure estimates are subject to periodic review and adjustment in light of changing economic  regulatory  environmental and conservation factors 
other additions other property  plant and equipment additions were million in puget energy expects infrastrux s capital additions to be million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
construction expenditure estimates are subject to periodic review and adjustment in light of changing economic  regulatory  environmental and conservation factors 
capital resources cash from operations cash generated from operations net of dividends and afudc totaled million for the three year period  and provided of the million of utility construction expenditures net of afudc and other capital expenditure requirements for that period 
internal cash generation net of dividends and afudc provided of total capital expenditure requirements in  in  and in puget energy and pse expect to continue financing the utility construction program and other capital expenditure requirements with internally generated funds and externally financed capital 
financing program financing utility construction requirements and operational needs is dependent upon the amount of internally generated funds and the cost and availability of external funds through capital markets and from financial institutions 
access to funds is dependent upon factors such as general economic conditions  regulatory authorizations and policies  and puget energy s and pse s credit ratings 
restrictive covenants in determining the type and amount of future financing  pse may be limited by restrictions contained in its electric and gas mortgage indentures  articles of incorporation and certain loan agreements 
under the most restrictive tests  at december   pse could issue approximately million of additional first mortgage bonds  at an assumed interest rate of on a ten year first mortgage bond due to a limitation of the interest coverage ratio 
pse has approximately billion of electric and gas bondable property available for use for issuance of up to million of first mortgage bonds  subject to the interest coverage ratio limitation of times net earnings available for interest 
pse s interest coverage ratio at december  was times net earnings available for interest  approximately million of additional preferred stock at an assumed dividend rate of  and approximately million of unsecured long term debt 
credit ratings neither puget energy nor pse has any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of outstanding debt 
however  a downgrade in the senior unsecured credit ratings could adversely affect the companies ability to renew existing  or obtain access to new  credit facilities and could increase the cost of such facilities 
for example  under pse s revolving credit facility  the spreads over the index and commitment fee increase as pse s secured long term debt ratings decline 
a downgrade in commercial paper ratings could preclude pse s ability to issue commercial paper under its current programs 
the marketability of pse commercial paper is currently limited by the a p ratings by standard poor s and moody s investors service 
a further downgrade in commercial paper ratings could preclude entirely pse s ability to issue commercial paper 
in addition  downgrades in any or a combination of pse s debt ratings may allow counterparties on a contract by contract basis in the wholesale electric  wholesale gas and financial derivative markets to require pse to post a letter of credit or other collateral  make cash prepayments  obtain a guarantee agreement or provide other mutually agreeable security 
the current ratings of puget energy and pse  as of february   are ratings puget energy standard poor s moody s corporate credit issuer rating bbb ba puget sound energy corporate credit issuer rating bbb baa senior secured debt bbb baa shelf debt senior secured bbb baa senior unsecured bb baa preferred stock bb ba commercial paper a p subordinate ba revolving credit facility baa ratings outlook stable negative no ratings provided 
moody s investors service has stated that its negative outlook is based upon uncertainty about the outcome of investigations by ferc of western power markets 
moody s remains concerned about what conclusions will ultimately be drawn by ferc with respect to year sales in western power markets and what other steps they might take as the investigation runs its full course 
shelf registrations in february  puget energy and pse filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission for the offering  on a delayed or continuous basis  of up to million principal amount of common stock of puget energy  senior notes of pse  secured by a pledge of pse s first mortgage bonds  unsecured debentures of pse  and trust preferred securities of puget sound energy capital trust iii 
on november   puget energy sold million shares of common stock in a public offering 
the net proceeds of approximately million were invested in pse to reduce its debt 
pse is expected to refinance million of its pollution control bonds series in march or april liquidity facilities and commercial paper pse s short term borrowings and sales of commercial paper are used to provide working capital for the utility construction program 
on december   pse entered into a million unsecured day credit agreement with various banks and a million year receivables securitization program 
these facilities replaced pse s entire million bank line of credit which was scheduled to terminate on february  at december   pse had available million of liquidity facilities  which in part provide credit support for outstanding commercial paper of million  effectively reducing the available borrowing capacity under the liquidity facilities to million 
in june  infrastrux signed a three year credit agreement with several banks to provide up to million in financing 
puget energy is the guarantor of the line of credit 
in addition  infrastrux s subsidiaries have an additional million in lines of credit with various banks 
borrowings available for infrastrux are used to fund acquisitions and working capital requirements of infrastrux and its subsidiaries 
at december   infrastrux and its subsidiaries had outstanding loans of million  effectively reducing the available borrowing capacity under these lines of credit to million 
stock purchase and dividend reinvestment plan puget energy has a stock purchase and dividend reinvestment plan pursuant to which shareholders and other interested investors may invest cash and cash dividends in shares of puget energy s common stock 
since new shares of common stock may be purchased directly from puget energy  funds received may be used for general corporate purposes 
puget energy issued common stock from the stock purchase and dividend reinvestment plan of million  shares in compared to million  shares in the decrease in the stock purchase and dividend reinvestment plan from to was largely attributable to the reduction of the common stock dividend on may  to a quarterly dividend of per share 
rate matters electric on march   the washington commission approved and adopted an unopposed settlement stipulation to resolve the interim phase of the rate case  in order to allow million in additional revenue to be recovered in rates over an approximate period of three months  commencing april  on june   the parties and intervenors to the general rate case filed a settlement stipulation for electric and common issues  which called for an electric general rate increase of million annually 
on june   the washington commission approved and adopted the settlement stipulation in the general case  putting new rates into effect on july  pse established a pca mechanism in the rate case settlement 
the pca mechanism will account for differences in pse s modified actual power costs relative to a power cost baseline 
the mechanism would account for a sharing of costs and benefits that are graduated over four levels of power cost variances  with an overall cap of million over the four year period july  through june  the factors influencing the variability of power costs included in the proposal are primarily weather or market related 
pse will be allowed to file for rate increases to implement limited power supply cost increases related to new resources 
pse s share of the power costs through december  was million 
because of adverse hydro conditions in  pse anticipates reaching the million cumulative cap under the pca mechanism by the fourth quarter of under the pca mechanism  further increases in variable power costs through june   would be apportioned to customers and to pse 
rate matters gas on august  the washington commission approved a decrease in pse s natural gas rates of due to lower natural gas costs purchased for customers under terms of the pga mechanism effective september  also  on may  the washington commission allowed a decrease in pga rates of to become effective on june  this ended a temporary surcharge that went into effect september  the pga mechanism passes through to customers increases or decreases in the gas supply portion of the natural gas service rates based upon changes in the price of natural gas purchased from producers and wholesale marketers or changes in gas pipeline transportation costs 
pse s gas margin and net income are not affected by changes under the pga 
on august   the washington commission approved a gas service rate increase in revenue to cover higher costs of providing natural gas service to customers 
this service related increase in revenues of approximately million annually was offset by an annual million or pga rate reduction  also approved on august  on september   pse filed a proposal with the washington commission to reduce natural gas supply rates under the pga for the third time in the washington commission approved the proposal on october  and pse lowered gas rates through the pga by approximately effective november  proceedings relating to the western power market california independent system operator caiso receivable and california proceedings pse operates within the western wholesale market and made sales into the california energy market during the fourth quarter of through the caiso 
in  pg e and southern california edison defaulted on payment obligations owed to various energy suppliers  including the caiso 
the caiso in turn defaulted on its payment obligations to pse and various other energy suppliers 
on march   southern california edison paid its past due energy obligations to the caiso and various other parties  however  those funds were not used to pay the outstanding balance of the caiso obligations to pse 
pse is continuing to pursue recovery of the caiso receivable 
on october   the caiso determined a refund was due to pse totaling million in connection with a ferc order of august  that determined parties that paid the caiso transmission access charges for energy delivered into the caiso s control area in calendar had been overcharged by the caiso 
pse received million of this refund on october   which was credited to the caiso receivable  reducing the receivable balance recorded by pse to million 
pse has a bad debt reserve and a transaction fee reserve totaling million in connection with the caiso receivable  such that the net receivable at december  was million 
the balance of the refund has not been paid by the caiso 
on july   ferc ordered an evidentiary hearing docket no 
el to determine the amount of refunds due to california energy buyers  including the caiso  for purchases made in the spot markets operated by the caiso during the period october  through june  hearings on the ferc california refund proceeding commenced in august in san francisco  california  and concluded in washington  dc in september on december   the administrative law judge conducting the hearings issued his certification of proposed findings on california refund liability to ferc 
the certification includes an appendix that reflects what the administrative law judge labeled as ballpark estimates of amounts owed and owing 
the judge did not make exact findings  because the report contemplates further calculations by the caiso 
the report also enters various findings within the text of the opinion  but those findings are not reflected in the appendix 
the appendix indicates that the net cash position as of march for pse would be an amount due to pse of million  and the refund pse would owe to the caiso would be million making a net receivable for pse of million 
the appendix calculations did not include  however  two stipulations and or findings from the body of the opinion that excluded certain pse transactions from refund liability  primarily because they were not spot market transactions 
applying those stipulations would reduce the refund pse would owe by million  and make the net pse receivable approximately million 
the certification also states that the amounts owing should be adjusted for interest  a calculation the administrative law judge did not make 
ferc has expressed an intention to act on the administrative law judge s certification and any other submissions in the docket  as discussed below in the spring of the projected schedule for resolution of the refund proceedings could change significantly  however  if ferc were to adopt changes in the refund methodology employed during the hearings  as proposed in the ferc s staff s report discussed below 
the ferc staff issued a report in august docket no 
pa that  among other things  recommends that ferc modify the methodology for calculating refunds in the california refund proceeding docket no 
el by adopting  as a proxy for the cost of natural gas  producing basin spot prices plus transportation costs  instead of reported spot prices for natural gas at california delivery points 
if adopted as proposed  this methodology of calculating the cost of natural gas would reduce the amount owed by the caiso to pse for sales made during and pse s estimates indicate that the changes in methodology would reduce pse s net receivable to approximately million as compared to the million  calculated by the administrative law judge 
the current net receivable recorded by pse  including the effects of the caiso refund  is million 
on august   ferc issued a notice docket no 
el requesting comments on whether the method used to determine the cost of natural gas for the refund calculation in the california refund proceeding should be modified  whether the ferc staff s substitute method is appropriate and  if not  what method should be used  and what is the proper way to reflect the effects of scarcity on price 
pse jointly sponsored testimony and filed comments in opposition to the recommendations in the ferc staff s report on october  the issue remains pending before ferc and no schedule for decision has been announced 
on november   ferc issued an order on motion for discovery order in the el docket that granted a motion to allow parties to adduce additional evidence into the refund proceedings that is either indicative or counter indicative of market manipulation 
the order also authorized an appointment of an administrative law judge as a discovery master  and permits the parties to conduct discovery and file any such evidence no later than february  on february  ferc issued an order on clarification that provides for reply submissions by any party on or before march  like the november discovery order  the february order expressly states that the commission intends to finalize the issues in these dockets expeditiously and observes that the commission sees no need for additional discovery procedures following the february  submission of evidence 
on february   ferc extended the filing deadlines to march  for the initial submissions and march  for replies  due to the east coast blizzard 
in the march filing by the california parties  they reiterated their allegations of market manipulation against pse and approximately other companies 
pse and the other parties are expected to respond on march  on may   ferc conditionally dismissed a complaint filed on march  by the california attorney general in docket el that alleged violations of the federal power act by ferc and all sellers including pse of electric power and energy into california 
the complaint asserted that ferc s adoption and implementation of market rate authority was flawed and  as a result  that individual sellers such as pse were liable for sales of energy at rates that were unjust and unreasonable 
the condition for dismissal was that all sellers re file transaction summaries of sales to and  after a clarifying order issued on june   purchases from certain california entities during and pse re filed such transaction summaries on july and july  the order of dismissal is now on appeal to the ninth circuit court of appeals 
on the same day as ferc s order in docket el was entered  the california attorney general announced it had filed individual complaints against a number of sellers  including pse  in california superior court in san francisco 
that complaint alleges that pse s sales to california violated the requirements of the federal power act and that  as such  the sales also violated certain sections of the california business practices act forbidding unlawful business practices 
the complaint asserts that each such violation subjects pse to a fine of up to  plus an award of attorneys fees and asserts that there were thousands of such violations 
pse has removed that suit to federal court and has moved to dismiss it on the grounds that the issues are within the exclusive or primary jurisdiction of ferc 
that motion was argued on september  and the question is under submission to the judge 
during may  pse was served with two cross complaints  by reliant energy services and duke energy trading marketing  respectively  in six consolidated class actions pending in superior court in san diego  california 
the original complaints in the action  which were brought by or on behalf of electricity purchasers in california  allege that the original approximately defendants manipulated the wholesale electricity markets in violation of various california business practices act or cartwright act antitrust provisions 
the plaintiffs in the lawsuit seek  among other things  restitution of all funds acquired by means that violate the law and payment of treble damages  interest and penalties 
the cross complaints assert essentially that the cross defendants  including pse  were also participants in the energy market in california at the relevant times  and that any remedies ordered against some market participants should be ordered against all 
reliant energy services and duke energy trading marketing also seek indemnity and conditional relief as a buyer in transactions involving cross defendants should the plaintiffs prevail 
those cross complaints added over new defendants  including pse  to litigation that had been pending since and had been set for trial in state court 
some of the newly added defendants removed the litigation to federal court 
the federal court in san diego remanded the case to california state court in an order issued in december pse and numerous other defendants added by the cross complaints have moved to dismiss these claims 
those motions were argued on september   but the federal judge did not rule on those motions in his order remanding the case to state court 
the remand order is now being reconsidered 
pse and the other defendants that moved to dismiss the claims intend to submit their motion to the appropriate court at the earliest practical date 
as a result of the various motions  no trial date is set at this time 
other proceedings on may   ferc issued a data request concerning specific trading strategies described in memos prepared by enron corporation to all sellers  including pse  of wholesale electricity and or ancillary services to the caiso and or the california power exchange corporation during the years on may and may   ferc issued additional data requests to all sellers of wholesale electricity or natural gas in the western united states  including pse  concerning wash or roundtrip trading activities 
each of the three requests required the sellers to respond with an affidavit concerning the seller s use or knowledge of various trading practices identified in the request 
in response to the data requests  pse conducted a review of its activities and informed ferc that it did not engage in the trading activity described in the applicable request 
in october  pse provided information in response to a request by the us commodity futures trading commission cftc for information about a limited number of specific transactions with regional counterparties which have been the subject of an investigation by the cftc 
pse s own review of these trades concluded that all the transactions were lawful and served normal business purposes 
in january  pse was asked to provide additional information to the cftc  primarily concerning the results of any pse internal investigation as to its trading activities and reports to indices 
pse responded to that request by providing information in february in december  pse was named as one of more than defendants in two class actions  one filed in the federal district court in seattle and the other in multnomah county circuit court in oregon 
pse was served with the complaint and summons in the washington federal court case on february  but as of march  had not been served in the oregon case 
nonetheless  the oregon case was removed to oregon federal court by reliant energy services on february  the complaints allege that they are brought on behalf of all retail customers in washington and oregon  respectively  and seek relief against the defendants each of which is a seller of electric energy at wholesale in certain markets for unfair or deceptive acts  fraud by concealment  negligence and for an accounting 
no specific amounts of damages are pled in the complaints 
pse cannot predict the outcome of any of these ongoing proceedings relating to the western power markets  or whether the ultimate impact on pse will be material 
other on october   the united association of plumbers and pipefitters ratified with pse a new four year collective bargaining agreement 
effective dates for the new contract are october  to october  the contract covers approximately pse employees 
in addition  on december   the international brotherhood of electrical workers ratified an agreement to extend their collective bargaining agreement with pse through march  this contract covers approximately pse employees 
on july   ferc issued its notice of proposed rulemaking on remedying undue discrimination through open access transmission service and standard electricity market design smd nopr 
the smd nopr would have major implications for the delivery of electric energy throughout the u 
s if enacted in its proposed form 
major elements of ferc s proposal include a the use of network access service to replace the existing network and point to point services 
all customers  including load serving entities on behalf of bundled retail load  would be required to take network service under a new pro forma tariff  b vertically integrated utilities would be required to retain independent transmission providers to administer the new tariff and functionally operate transmission systems  c the formation of regional state advisory committees and other regional entities to coordinate the planning  certification and siting of new transmission facilities in cooperation with states 
state regulators and industry representatives have pointed out that the western north american electricity market has unique characteristics that may not readily lend itself to the standard market design proposed by ferc 
ferc has expressed its willingness to offer regional flexibility in its order on rto west  docket nos 
rt and rt  issued september  on december   ferc issued a notice extending the deadline for comments addressing market design for the western interconnection to february   but the notice also indicates ferc will accept late filed comments through february  the company has filed comments 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires that management apply accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements 
the following areas represent those that management believes are particularly important to the financial statements and that require the use of estimates and assumptions to describe matters that are inherently uncertain revenue recognition utility revenue is recognized when the basis of service is rendered  including estimates used for unbilled revenue 
non utility revenue is recognized when services are performed or upon the sale of assets 
the recognition of revenue is in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  which requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenue 
ferc accounting puget energy s regulated subsidiary  pse  prepares its financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and in conformity with ferc s uniform system of accounts 
the washington commission also requires pse to use ferc s uniform system of accounts 
cost based regulation puget energy s regulated subsidiary  pse  is subject to regulation by the washington commission and ferc 
the rates that are charged by pse to its customers are based upon cost base regulation reviewed and approved by these regulatory commissions 
under the authority of these commissions  pse has recorded certain regulatory assets and liabilities in the amount of million as of december  derivatives puget energy uses derivative financial instruments primarily to manage its commodity price risks 
derivative financial instruments are accounted for under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
accounting for derivatives continues to evolve through guidance issued by the derivatives implementation group dig of the financial accounting standards board 
to the extent that changes by the dig modify current guidance  including the normal purchases and normal sales determination  the accounting treatment for derivatives may change 
to manage its electric and gas portfolios  puget energy enters into contracts to purchase or sell electricity and gas 
these contracts are considered derivatives under sfas no 
unless a determination is made that they qualify for normal purchases and normal sales exclusion 
if the exclusion applies  those contracts are not marked to market and are not reflected in the financial statements until delivery occurs 
the availability of the normal purchases and normal sales exclusion to specific contracts is based on a determination that a resource is available for a forward sale and similarly a determination that at certain times existing resources will be insufficient to serve load 
this determination is based on internal models that forecast customer demand and generation supply 
the models include assumptions regarding customer load growth rates  which are influenced by the economy  weather and the impact of customer choice  and resource availability 
the critical assumptions used in the determination of normal purchases and normal sales are consistent with assumptions used in the general planning process 
energy contracts that are considered derivatives may be eligible for designation as cash flow hedges 
if a contract is designated as a cash flow hedge  the change in its market value is generally deferred as a component of other comprehensive income until the transaction it is hedging is completed 
conversely  the change in the market value of derivatives not designated as cash flow hedges is recorded in current period earnings 
when external quoted market prices are not available for derivative contracts  puget uses a valuation model which uses volatility assumptions relating to future energy prices based on specific energy markets and utilizes externally available forward market price curves 
the company believes that the risk of non performance by its counterparties is remote 
defined pension plan puget energy has a qualified defined benefit plan covering substantially all employees of pse 
for  and qualified pension income of million  million and million  respectively  has been recorded in the financial statements 
changes in market values of stocks or interest rates will affect the amount of income that puget energy can record in its financial statements in future years 
qualified pension income is expected to decline to million in as a result of lower actual returns on pension assets during the last three years and declining expected rates of return on pension fund assets 
during  pse transitioned service jobs that had previously been held by pse employees to outside service providers 
under sfas no 
employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits  pse recorded a curtailment loss of approximately million 
california independent system operator reserve pse operates within the western wholesale market and has made sales into the california energy market 
during the first quarter of  pse received partial payments for sales made in the fourth quarter of at december   pse s receivables from the caiso and other counter parties  net of reserves  were million 
at december   such receivables  net of reserves  were approximately million

new accounting pronouncements in january  financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
fin clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
consolidated financial statements to certain entities in which equity investors do not have controlling interest or sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional financial support 
this interpretation requires that if a business entity has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity the financial statements must be included in the consolidated financial statements of the business entity 
the adoption of this interpretation for all interests in variable interest entities created after january  is effective immediately 
for variable interest entities created before february   it is effective july  the company is in the process of determining the impacts of this interpretation 
on january   sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets became effective and as a result  puget energy ceased amortization of goodwill associated with the infrastrux business 
during  puget energy had approximately million of goodwill amortization 
puget energy performed an initial impairment review of goodwill and will perform an annual impairment review thereafter 
the initial review was completed during the first half of  and did not result in an impairment charge 
puget energy then performed its annual impairment review as of october  and determined that its goodwill was not impaired 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  sfas no 
requires legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets to be recognized at their fair value at the time that the obligations are incurred 
upon initial recognition of a liability  that cost should be capitalized as part of the related long lived asset and allocated to expense over the useful life of the asset 
the company will adopt the new rules on asset retirement obligations on january  application of the new rules is not expected to result in a material increase in net property  plant and equipment or expense 
the emerging issues task force of the financial accounting standards board eitf or task force at its june meeting came to a consensus on one of three items included in eitf issue accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities eitf 
the task force has agreed that all mark to market gains and losses on energy trading contracts whether realized or unrealized will be shown net in the income statement costs offset against revenues  irrespective of whether the contract is physically settled 
the presentation will be applicable to financial statements for periods ending after july  the company performs risk management activities to optimize the value of energy supply and transmission assets and to ensure that physical energy supply is available to meet the customer demand loads 
the company also purchases energy when demand exceeds available supplies in its portfolio  likewise the company makes sales to other utilities and marketers when surplus energy is available 
these transactions are part of the company s normal operations to meet retail load 
the company has reclassified all settled transactions that meet the definition of optimization trading transactions that optimize hydro resources  and purchases and sales between trading points net in the income statement to conform to the new presentation required under eitf the company previously reported these transactions when settled in a gross manner in the income statement in electric operating revenue and purchased electricity expense 
unrealized gains or losses on derivative instruments that are required to be marked to market remain reflected in unrealized gain loss on derivative instruments on puget energy s and pse s income statement as required by sfas no 
the adoption of eitf does not have any impact on the previously reported net income of the company 
the following optimization transactions were recorded in electric operating revenue years ended december  dollars in thousands optimization sales    optimization purchases    net margin on optimization transactions    item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risks  including changes in commodity prices and interest rates 
portfolio management the nature of serving regulated customers with its wholesale portfolio of owned and contracted resources does expose the company to some volumetric and commodity price risks 
the company s energy risk management function monitors and manages these risks using analytical models and tools 
the company manages its energy supply portfolio to achieve three primary objectives i ensure that physical energy supplies are available to serve retail customer requirements  ii manage portfolio risks to limit undesired impacts on the company s financial results and to stabilize earnings  and iii optimize the value of the company s energy supply assets 
the portfolio is subject to major sources of variability eg  hydro generation  outage risk  regional economic factors  temperature sensitive retail sales  and market prices for gas and power supplies 
at certain times  these sources of variability can mitigate portfolio imbalances  at other times they can exacerbate portfolio imbalances 
the company s energy risk management staff develops hedging strategies for the company s energy supply portfolio 
the first priority is to protect against unwanted risk exposure 
the second priority is to fully optimize excess capacity or flexibility within the wholesale portfolio 
most hedges can be implemented in ways that retain the company s ability to use its energy supply optimization opportunities 
still other hedges are structured similarly to insurance instruments  where pse pays an insurance premium to protect against certain extreme conditions 
the prices of energy commodities are subject to fluctuations due to unpredictable factors including weather  generation outages and other factors which impact supply and demand 
the volumetric and commodity price risk is a consequence of purchasing energy at fixed and variable prices and providing deliveries at different tariff and variable prices 
costs associated with ownership and operation of production facilities are another component of this risk 
the company may use forward delivery agreements  swaps and option contracts for the purpose of hedging commodity price risk 
without jeopardizing the security of supply within its portfolio  the company will also engage in optimizing the portfolio 
optimization may take the form of utilizing excess capacity  shaping flexible resources to capture their highest value  utilizing transmission capacity or capitalizing on market price movement 
as a result  portions of the company s energy portfolio are monetized through use of forward price instruments 
transactions that qualify as hedge transactions under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
changes in fair value of the company s derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other comprehensive income 
at december   the company had an after tax net liability of approximately million of energy contracts designated as qualifying cash flow hedges and a corresponding unrealized gain amount in other comprehensive income 
the company also had energy contracts that were marked to market through current earnings for of million after tax 
a hypothetical increase in the market prices of natural gas and electricity would increase the fair value of qualifying cash flow hedges by approximately million after tax and would reduce current earnings for those contracts marked to market in earnings by an immaterial amount 
in addition  the company believes its pca and the pga mechanism mitigate a portion of this risk 
market risk is managed subject to parameters established by the board of directors 
the company has established a risk management committee composed of company officers that monitors compliance with the company s policies and procedures 
in addition  the audit committee of the company s board of directors has oversight of the risk management committee 
the fair value of energy contracts that are recorded in the balance sheet of the company are comprised of the following net of tax derivative contracts dollars in millions amounts fair value of contracts outstanding december  
contracts realized or otherwise settled during 
changes in fair values of derivatives 
fair value of contracts outstanding at december  
fair value of contracts with settlement during year source of fair value dollars in millions and thereafter total fair value prices based on models and other valuation methods 

short term derivative contracts for the purchase and sale of electricity are valued based upon daily quoted prices from an independent energy brokerage service 
values for short term and medium term natural gas swap contracts are derived from a combination of quotes from several independent energy brokers and are updated daily 
long term gas swap contracts are valued based on published pricing from a combination of independent brokerage services and are updated monthly 
option contracts are valued using a modified black scholes model approach 
interest rate risk the company believes its interest rate risk primarily relates to the use of short term debt instruments  variable rate leases and long term debt financing needed to fund capital requirements 
the company manages its interest rate risk through the issuance of mostly fixed rate debt of various maturities 
the company does utilize bank borrowings  commercial paper and line of credit facilities to meet short term cash requirements 
these short term obligations are commonly refinanced with fixed rate bonds or notes when needed and when interest rates are considered favorable 
the company may enter into swap instruments to manage the interest rate risk associated with these debts and did not have any swap instruments outstanding as of december  or the carrying amounts and fair values of puget energy s fixed rate debt instruments are dollars in millions carrying amount fair value carrying amount fair value financial liabilities short term debt
