table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we were incorporated in california in april and reincorporated in delaware in april we are one of the world s largest fabless semiconductor companies  supplying graphics and media communications processors and related software that are integral to personal computers  professional workstations and digital entertainment platforms 
we provide an architecturally compatible top to bottom family of award winning graphics processing units  or gpus  which set the standard for performance  quality  compatibility and features for a broad range personal computing platforms 
our graphics and communications processors are used for a wide variety of applications  including games  digital content creation  personal digital image editing  business productivity and product and industrial design 
our mission is to be the most important visual computing company in the world 
recent developments microsoft pricing settlement we were engaged with microsoft in discussions related to pricing and volumes of the xbox chipset 
these discussions and our agreement contemplated use of a third party to resolve matters and on april  microsoft submitted the matter to binding arbitration 
on february   nvidia and microsoft announced that the companies had settled all issues related to pricing of the microsoft xbox gpu and mcp chipset and have ended the arbitration between them 
in addition to resolving this pricing dispute  we have agreed to collaborate with microsoft on future cost reductions for the xbox 
as a result of the settlement  we recognized million in additional revenue in fiscal strategic alliance with ibm on march   we announced that we have formed a multi year strategic alliance under which ibm will manufacture our next generation geforce gpus 
as part of the agreement  we will gain access to ibm s suite of foundry services and manufacturing technologies  including power efficient copper wiring  and a roadmap that is designed to lead to nm nanometer  a billionth of a meter in the next several years  giving us valuable tools to advance our gpus 
ibm plans to begin manufacturing the next generation geforce graphics processor this summer at ibm s plant in east fishkill  new york 
beyond the chip manufacturing technology  ibm also offers an automated management system that not only controls production on the factory floor  but provides a connection for customer and supplier systems and processes  allowing closer integration across the supply chain 
ibm s automated management system provides us with opportunities ranging from improved operation to greater efficiency and competitive advantage  while using e business techniques to adapt to real time  on demand influences from the marketplace 
securities exchange commission in april  subsequent to receiving a wells notice indicating the sec staff intended to recommend to the sec that an enforcement action be initiated  we reached an agreement in principle with the sec staff that would resolve the sec s investigation of us in matters related to the restatement 
the agreement is subject to final approval of the sec 
under the terms of the agreement in principle  nvidia  without admitting or denying liability or wrongdoing  would agree to an administrative cease and desist order prohibiting any future violations 
table of contents of certain non fraud financial reporting  books and records  and internal control provisions of the federal securities laws 
we would not be required to pay any fines or penalties 
the documentation of the agreement and the sec s review of the agreement may take several weeks or months to complete 
further  there can be no assurance that the agreement will be approved by the sec 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to customer programs  revenue recognition  sales returns  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them in this md a 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the price is fixed and determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
our policy on sales to distributors and stocking representatives is to defer recognition of revenue and related cost of revenue until the distributors and representatives resell the product 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs at the time revenue is recognized 
if market conditions decline  we may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings  possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered 
we also record a reduction to revenue for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized based on historical return rates 
for all sales  we use a binding purchase order and in certain cases we use a contractual agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
we consider delivery to occur upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 
at the point of sale  we assess whether the arrangement fee is fixed and determinable and whether collection is reasonably assured 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts and for estimated losses resulting from the financial inability of our customers to make required payments 
management determines this allowance  which consists of an amount identified for specific customer issues as well as an amount based on general estimated exposure 
our overall estimated exposure excludes amounts covered by credit insurance and letters of credit 
if the financial condition of our customers or insurance carrier were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required that could adversely affect our operating results 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain credit insurance in the future 
as of january   our allowance for doubtful accounts was million and our gross trade receivable balance was million 
of the million  million was covered by credit insurance and million was covered by letters of credit 
as a percentage of our gross trade receivables  our allowance for 
table of contents doubtful accounts has ranged between and 
as of january   our allowance for doubtful accounts represented of our gross trade receivables 
if our allowance for doubtful accounts would have been recorded at or of gross trade receivables then our balance at january  would have been approximately million or million  respectively  rather than the actual balance of million 
inventories we write down our inventory for estimated lower of cost or market  obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required that could adversely affect our operating results 
if actual market conditions are more favorable  we may have higher gross margins when products are sold 
no significant sales of such products have occurred to date 
income taxes statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  sfas establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes 
in accordance with sfas  we recognize federal  state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction 
we also recognize federal  state and foreign deferred tax liabilities or assets for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards  and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that  based on available evidence and judgment  are not expected to be realized 
for the fiscal year ended january   we recorded net deferred tax assets of million that we believe will be recovered 
however  should there be a change in our ability to recover any or part of the deferred tax asset of million  our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determine that the recovery is not probable 
as of january   we recorded a valuation allowance of the valuation allowance is attributable to certain net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards resulting from the exercise of employee stock options 
the tax benefit of these net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards  when realized  will be accounted for as a credit to shareholders equity 
restatement on april   the company announced that it would be restating its previously reported results for the first three quarters of fiscal and for fiscal years and this restatement was the result of an extensive review directed by the company s independent audit committee  with assistance from the law firm of cooley godward llp and forensic accountants from kpmg llp 
the company s audit committee initiated its review at the request of  and in full cooperation with  the staff of the securities exchange commission sec 
the company s audit committee and its team conducted a thorough review of the company s records with respect to all issues raised by the sec staff for the periods mentioned 
the company s audit committee worked in close cooperation with the sec to provide it with extensive information and conclusions of the review 
as discussed in the form k filed by nvidia on may   the adjustments that were reflected in our restated financial statements fell generally into four categories the first category involved mistakes that were found as a result of the internal review process undertaken by our audit committee 
an example of this first category is the accidental double booking of an expense 
the second category involved adjustments relating to estimates made in connection with accruals  in which we concluded that there was not sufficient current evidence to support an estimate 

table of contents the third area related to past accounting judgments that  upon review  we concluded were incorrect  but we did not reach a conclusion whether they were made in good faith or bad faith 
the fourth category related to waived audit adjustments for prior periods  which were items previously identified as part of the normal quarterly review and annual audit process  but for which we had concluded we were not required to make adjusting entries in order to prepare our financial statements under generally accepted accounting principles 
for additional information on the restatement  refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items in our consolidated statements of income expressed as a percentage of revenue 
year ended january  january  january  revenue cost of revenue cost of revenue related to stock option exchange gross profit operating expenses research and development sales  general and administrative stock option exchange amortization of goodwill acquisition related charges discontinued use of property total operating expenses operating income interest and other income  net income before income tax expense income tax expense net income fiscal years ended january   january   and january  revenue revenue was billion in fiscal  billion in fiscal  and million in fiscal  which represented an increase of from fiscal to and from fiscal to the growth was primarily the result of increased sales of our graphics processors driven by significant shipments of xbox processors in addition to the strong overall demand for our products in the workstation  mobile and platform processor product lines 
revenue from sales to customers outside of the united states and north america accounted for and of total revenue for fiscal and  respectively 
revenue by geographical region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the foreign cems and add in board and motherboard manufacturers revenue is attributable to end customers located in the united states 
the decrease in the percentage of revenue from sales to customers outside of the united states is primarily attributable to increased sales of the graphics and media communication processors used in the microsoft xbox product billed to microsoft in the united states 

table of contents although we achieved substantial growth in revenue from fiscal to and fiscal to  we do not expect to sustain this rate of growth in future periods 
in addition  we expect that the average selling prices of our products will decline over the lives of the products 
the declines in average selling prices of d graphics processors in general may accelerate as the market continues to develop and competition increases 
gross profit gross profit consists of total revenue  net of allowances  less cost of revenue 
cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors including wafer fabrication  assembly  testing and packaging  manufacturing support costs including labor and overhead associated with such purchases  final test yield fallout  inventory provisions and shipping costs 
our gross margin can vary in any period depending on the mix of types of graphics processors sold 
gross margin is the ratio of gross profit to revenue 
our gross margins were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
gross margin for fiscal as compared to fiscal decreased primarily due to the shift in mix of business and an inventory write down 
during fiscal  sales of xbox processors  which generally have lower margins than our other products  comprised of our overall revenue as compared to in fiscal see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for further description of our relationship with microsoft 
in addition  during the second quarter of fiscal we wrote down inventory of approximately million related to certain xbox processors and nforce chipsets 
gross margin increased from fiscal to fiscal due to an increase in unit shipments and the favorable impact of the higher margin geforce graphics processors  partially offset by increased sales of the lower margin xbox graphics and media communication processors 
in the future  we could be subject to excess or obsolete inventories and be required to take additional write downs if growth slows or if we incorrectly forecast product demand 
a reduction in demand could negatively impact our gross margins 
although we achieved substantial growth in gross profit during fiscal from the same period a year ago  we do not expect to sustain this rate of growth in future periods 
operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses consist of salaries and benefits  cost of development tools and software  cost of new product prototypes and consultant costs 
research and development expenses increased by million  or  from fiscal to primarily due to a million increase related to additional personnel  a million increase associated with lab equipment  software licenses  maintenance fees and depreciation charges  a million increase related to engineering costs to develop our next generation products  and a million increase in facilities costs due to the move into a new building at our headquarters and a full year of occupation in all headquarter buildings as well as other expenses during the year 
research and development expenses increased by million  or  from fiscal to primarily due to a million increase related to additional personnel  including certain employees hired from dfx in connection with our acquisition of certain of their assets as discussed below  a million increase associated with lab equipment  software licenses  maintenance fees and depreciation charges  a million increase related to engineering costs to develop our next generation products  and a million increase in facilities costs due to the move into several buildings at our new headquarters and other expenses during the year 
we anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development  and we expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future due to the increased complexity and the greater number of products under development 
research and development expenses are likely to fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make periodic incremental investments in research and development and these investments may be independent of our level of revenues 
sales  general and administrative 
sales  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and bonuses  promotional tradeshow and advertising expenses  travel and entertainment expenses and legal and accounting expenses 
sales  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from fiscal to primarily due to a million increase related to additional personnel and 
table of contents commissions  a million increase in legal and accounting expenses associated with various legal proceedings  a million increase in equipment and software primarily related to the enhancement of our computer systems  a million increase in tradeshow and product launch costs  and a million increase in facilities costs due to the move into a new building at our headquarters and a full year of occupation in all headquarter buildings as well as other increases associated with general administrative activities and travel and entertainment expenses 
sales  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  from fiscal to primarily due to a million increase related to additional personnel and commissions  a million increase in tradeshow and product launch costs  and a million increase in facilities costs due to the move into several buildings at our new headquarters and other increases associated with general administrative activities  an american red cross donation associated with the events of september   and travel and entertainment expenses 
we expect sales  general and administrative expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars as we continue to support our operations  expand our sales and protect our business interests 
stock option exchange on september   we commenced an offer the offer to our employees to exchange outstanding stock options with exercise prices equal to or greater than per share eligible options 
stock options to purchase an aggregate of approximately  shares were eligible for tender at the commencement of the offer  representing approximately of our outstanding stock options as of the commencement date 
only employees of nvidia or one of our subsidiaries as of september  who continued to be employees through the offer termination date of october  were eligible to participate in the offer 
employees who were on medical  maternity  worker s compensation  military or other statutorily protected leave of absence  or a personal leave of absence  were also eligible to participate in the offer 
employees who were terminated on or before the offer termination date of october   were not eligible to participate in the offer 
in addition  our chief executive officer and chief financial officer and members of our board of directors were not eligible to participate in this offer 
eligible employees who participated in the offer received  in exchange for the cancellation of eligible options  a fixed amount of consideration  represented by fully vested  non forfeitable common stock and applicable withholding taxes  equal to the number of shares underlying such eligible options  multiplied by  less the amount of applicable tax withholdings  divided by  the closing price of our common stock as reported on the nasdaq national market on october  we concluded that the consideration paid for the eligible options represented substantial consideration as required by issue f of eitf issue no 
issues relating to accounting for stock compensation under apb opinion no 
and fasb interpretation no 
 as the per eligible option was at least the fair value for each eligible option  as determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
in determining the fair value of the eligible options using the black scholes option pricing model  we used the following assumptions i the expected remaining life was deemed to be the remaining term of the options  which was approximately years  ii a volatility of during the expected life  iii a risk free interest rate of  and iv no dividends 
the amount of per eligible option was established at the commencement of the offer period and remained unchanged throughout the offer period 
variable accounting is not required under issue a of eitf issue no 
for eligible options subject to the offer that were not surrendered for cancellation  because i the shares of our common stock offered as consideration for the surrendered options were fully vested and non forfeitable  and ii the number of shares to be received by an employee who accepted the offer was based on the number of surrendered eligible options multiplied by  divided by the fair value of the stock at the date of exchange 
we further concluded that the look back and look forward provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 paragraph did apply to the stock options surrendered for cancellation 
based on the terms of the offer  variable accounting is not required for any of our outstanding stock options existing at the time of the offer 
we do not intend to grant stock options to any participants in the offer for at least six months following october  if any stock options are granted to 
table of contents participants in the offer within the six months following october   those stock options will receive variable accounting 
on october   the offer period ended and we were obligated to exchange approximately  eligible options for total consideration of  consisting of  in fully vested  non forfeitable shares of our common stock approximately  shares and  in employer and employee related taxes 
the number of fully vested  non forfeitable shares of our common stock to be issued was determined by dividing the total consideration due less the amount of applicable tax withholdings by the closing price of our common stock on october   of per share 
the shares of our common stock issued in exchange for eligible options were fully vested 
however  a portion of the shares equal to of the total consideration  based on the closing price of our common stock on the offer termination date  have a six month holding period  and a portion of the shares equal to of such total consideration have a one year holding period 
withholding taxes and other charges were deducted from the remaining of the total consideration  and the shares issued after such withholding did not have a holding restriction 
amortization of goodwill during fiscal  amortization of goodwill was associated with goodwill from the asset purchase from dfx 
the initial allocation of the purchase price included million of goodwill  plus approximately million of intangible assets previously allocated to workforce in place  which was reclassified into goodwill as of the beginning of fiscal in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we no longer amortize goodwill as of the beginning of fiscal we have elected to perform our annual impairment review during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
we have completed our annual goodwill impairment test for fiscal and concluded that there was no impairment 
acquisition related charges acquisition related charges are attributable to expenses related to the acquisition of assets from dfx in fiscal these charges primarily consisted of bonuses for former dfx employees 
discontinued use of property discontinued use of property consists of write offs of million relating to our previous office space in santa clara  california 
since we relocated in june  we have been unable to secure a subtenant for our previous office space due to the decrease in demand for commercial rental space in silicon valley 
the write offs consist of all remaining costs related to the preexisting lease  including rental payments  capitalized leasehold improvements  and furniture and fixtures 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal interest income  which primarily consists of interest earned on cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased million from fiscal to due to the decline in market interest rates 
interest income increased million from fiscal to fiscal due to higher average cash balances as a result of a million advance received from microsoft in connection with our agreement with microsoft and the receipt of million from our convertible subordinated note and common stock offerings  which both closed in october interest expense  which primarily consists of interest incurred as a result of capital lease obligations and interest on our convertible debt was flat from fiscal to fiscal interest expense increased in fiscal 
table of contents compared to fiscal due to the issuance of million of convertible subordinated notes in october income taxes we recognized income tax expense of million  million and million in fiscal  and respectively 
income taxes as a percentage of pretax income were in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in the effective tax rate from fiscal to fiscal was primarily due to not recording any income tax expense or benefit for the third quarter of fiscal as our loss before income tax expense was primarily attributable to a stock compensation charge for which no tax benefit may be available 
liquidity and capital resources as of january   we had billion in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  an increase of million from the end of fiscal in august  we began to invest in marketable securities 
our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities is managed by several financial institutions 
our investment policy requires the purchase of top tier investment grade securities  the diversification of asset type and certain limits on our portfolio duration 
operating activities generated cash of million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in cash flows from operating activities in fiscal when compared to fiscal was primarily due to the decrease in inventories  prepaid expenses and other current assets and deferred tax assets offset by the decrease in accounts payable 
cash used in investing activities has consisted primarily of investments in marketable securities  the purchase of certain assets from various businesses and purchases of property and equipment  which include leasehold improvements for our facilities 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  primarily due to million of net purchases of marketable securities 
we incurred million in capital expenditures in fiscal primarily attributable to our new headquarters facility  as well as for purchases of computer and emulation equipment to support increased research and development 
we expect to spend approximately million to million for capital expenditures in fiscal  primarily for software licenses  emulation equipment  computer and engineering workstations and future phases of our enterprise resource planning system implementation 
in addition  we may continue to use cash in connection with the acquisition of businesses or assets 
financing activities provided cash of million during fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease in fiscal when compared to fiscal was due to a decrease in employee stock option exercises 
common stock and convertible subordinated debenture offering in october  we sold  shares of our common stock and million of convertible subordinated debentures due october  in a public offering 
proceeds from the offering were approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts  commissions and offering expenses 
issuance costs related to the offering are being amortized to interest expense on a straight line basis over the term of the debentures 
interest on the convertible subordinated debentures accrues at the rate of per annum and is payable semiannually in arrears on april and october of each year  commencing april  the convertible subordinated debentures are redeemable at our option on or after october  the debentures are convertible at the option of the holder at any time prior to the close of business on the maturity date  unless previously redeemed or repurchased  into shares of common stock at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 

table of contents dfx asset purchase on april   we completed the purchase of certain assets of dfx  including patents and patent applications 
under the terms of the asset purchase agreement  the cash consideration due at the closing was million  less million that was loaned to dfx pursuant to a credit agreement dated december  the asset purchase agreement also provides  subject to the other provisions thereof  that if dfx certifies to our satisfaction all its debts and other liabilities have been provided for  then we are obligated to pay dfx two million shares of nvidia common stock 
if dfx cannot make such a certification  but instead certifies to our satisfaction that its debts and liabilities can be satisfied for less than million  then dfx can elect to receive a cash payment equal to the amount of such debts and liabilities and receive a reduced number of shares of our common stock  with such reduction calculated by dividing the cash payment by per share 
if dfx cannot certify that all of its debts and liabilities have been provided for  or can be satisfied  for less than million  we are not obligated under the agreement to pay any additional consideration for the assets 
on october   dfx filed for chapter bankruptcy protection 
we believe that the bankruptcy filing by dfx will allow a determination of the full number and scope of dfx s debts and liabilities 
nvidia may be obligated under the asset purchase agreement to pay dfx the contingent consideration following this determination  subject to offsets for nvidia s claims against dfx arising from the asset purchase agreement 
on march   we were served with a complaint by the trustee for dfx seeking  among other things  additional payment for the purchased assets and the assumption by us of dfx s liabilities 
in addition  carlyle fortran trust and carramerica  former landlords of dfx  have filed suits against us seeking payment of the rents due by dfx 
contractual cash obligations the following summarizes our contractual cash obligations that are both on our balance sheet and off balance sheet as of january  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods contractual cash obligations total year years years after years in thousands convertible subordinated notes interest on convertible subordinated notes capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations royalty and license commitments other total contractual cash obligations our convertible subordinated notes due possess a fixed interest rate of 
the amount of interest obligation assumes that the notes are held until maturity and not redeemed or converted into shares of common stock at an earlier date 
the convertible subordinated notes are redeemable at our option on or after october  the notes are convertible at the option of the holder at any time prior to the close of business on the maturity date 
as such  actual future cash obligations may be significantly lower 
represents our noncancelable inventory purchase commitments as of january  operating capital and capital expenditure requirements we believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  there is no assurance that we will not need to raise additional equity or debt financing within this time frame 
additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all and may be dilutive to our then current stockholders 
we also may require additional capital for other purposes not presently contemplated 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient capital  we could be required to curtail capital equipment purchases or research and development expenditures  
table of contents which could harm our business 
factors that could affect our cash used or generated from operations and  as a result  our need to seek additional borrowings or capital include decreased demand and market acceptance for our products and or our customers products  inability to successfully develop and produce in volume production our next generation products  competitive pressures resulting in lower than expected average selling prices  and new product announcements or product introductions by our competitors 
for additional factors see business risks our operating results are unpredictable and may fluctuate  and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors  our stock price could decline 
other information consistent with section a i of the securities exchange act of  as added by section of the public company accounting reform and investor protection act of  nvidia is responsible for disclosing the nature of the non audit services approved by our audit committee during a quarter to be performed by kpmg llp  our independent auditor 
non audit services are services other than those provided by kpmg llp in connection with an audit or a review of nvidia s financial statements 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  our audit committee did approve new and recurring engagements performed by kpmg llp for the following non audit services income tax  transactional tax and payroll tax return preparation  general tax consultation and advice  international statutory audits  and consultation regarding accounting standards and issues 
recent accounting pronouncements information regarding recent accounting pronouncements is set forth in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements under the subheading new accounting pronouncements  which information is hereby incorporated by reference 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we invest in a variety of financial instruments  consisting principally of investments in commercial paper  money market funds and highly liquid debt securities of corporations  municipalities and the us government and its agencies 
these investments are denominated in us dollars 
we account for our investment instruments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
all of the cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as available for sale under sfas no 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
however  because our debt securities are classified as available for sale  no gains or losses are recognized due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity 
these securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity  net of tax 
as of january   a sensitivity analysis was performed on our floating and fixed rate financial investments 
parallel shifts in the yield curve of both basis points would result in changes in fair market values for these investments of approximately million 
our convertible subordinated notes due possess a fixed interest rate of and are not subject to interest rate fluctuations 

table of contents exchange rate risk we consider our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal 
currently  sales and arrangements with third party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in us dollars  and therefore are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations 
to date  we have not engaged in any currency hedging activities  although we may do so in the future 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates could harm our business in the future 
business risks in addition to the risks discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  our business is subject to the risks set forth below 
risks related to our operations our operating results are unpredictable and may fluctuate  and if our operating results are below the expectations of securities analysts or investors our stock price could decline 
many of our revenue components fluctuate and are difficult to predict  and our operating expenses are largely independent of revenue in any particular period 
it is therefore difficult for us to accurately forecast revenue and profits or losses 
as a result  it is possible that in some quarters our operating results could be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors  which could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline  perhaps substantially 
we believe that our quarterly and annual results of operations will be affected by a variety of factors that could harm our revenue  gross profit and results of operations 
factors that have affected our results of operations in the past  and could affect our results of operations in the future  include the following demand and market acceptance for our products and or our customers products  the successful development and volume production of next generation products  new product announcements or product introductions by our competitors  our ability to introduce new products in accordance with oem design requirements and design cycles  changes in the timing of product orders due to unexpected delays in the introduction of our customers products  fluctuations in the availability of manufacturing capacity or manufacturing yields  declines in spending by corporations and consumers related to perceptions regarding an economic downturn in the us and international economies  competitive pressures resulting in lower than expected average selling prices  product rates of return in excess of that forecasted or expected due to quality issues  the rescheduling or cancellation of customer orders  the loss of a key customer or the termination of a strategic relationship  seasonal fluctuations associated with the pc market  substantial disruption in our suppliers operations  either as a result of a natural disaster  equipment failure  terrorism or other cause  supply constraints for and changes in the cost of the other components incorporated into our customers products  including memory devices  our ability to reduce the manufacturing costs of our products  legal and other costs related to defending intellectual property and other types of lawsuits  bad debt write offs  
table of contents costs associated with the repair and replacement of defective products  unexpected inventory write downs  and introductions of enabling technologies to keep pace with faster generations of processors and controllers 
any one or more of the factors discussed above could prevent us from achieving our expected future revenue or net income 
our operating expenses are relatively fixed  and we order materials in advance of anticipated customer demand 
therefore  we have limited ability to reduce expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
most of our operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term  and we may be unable to adjust spending sufficiently in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected sales shortfall 
substantially all of our sales are made on the basis of purchase orders rather than long term agreements 
as a result  we may commit resources to the production of products without having received advance purchase commitments from customers 
any inability to sell products to which we have devoted significant resources could harm our business 
in addition  cancellation or deferral of product orders could result in our holding excess inventory  which could adversely affect our profit margins and restrict our ability to fund operations 
we may build memory and component inventories during periods of anticipated growth and in connection with selling workstation boards directly to major oems 
we could be subject to excess or obsolete inventories and be required to take corresponding write downs if growth slows or if we incorrectly forecast product demand 
a reduction in demand could negatively impact our gross margins and financial results 
we may be required to reduce prices in response to competition or to pursue new market opportunities 
if new competitors  technological advances by existing competitors or other competitive factors require us to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated in research and development or sales and marketing efforts  our business could suffer 
accordingly  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
in addition  the results of any quarterly period are not indicative of results to be expected for a full fiscal year 
we need to develop new products and to manage product transitions in order to succeed 
our business depends to a significant extent on our ability to successfully develop new products for the d graphics market 
our add in board and motherboard manufacturers and major oem customers typically introduce new system configurations as often as twice per year  typically based on spring and fall design cycles 
accordingly  our existing products must have competitive performance levels or we must timely introduce new products with such performance characteristics in order to be included in new system configurations 
this requires that we do the following anticipate the features and functionality that consumers will demand  incorporate those features and functionality into products that meet the exacting design requirements of pc oems  cems and add in board and motherboard manufacturers  price our products competitively  and introduce the products to the market within the limited window for pc oems and add in board and motherboard manufacturers 
as a result  we believe that significant expenditures for research and development will continue to be required in the future 
the success of new product introductions will depend on several factors  including the following proper new product definition  timely completion and introduction of new product designs  
table of contents the ability of ibm  tsmc and any additional third party manufacturers to effectively manufacture our new products in a timely manner  the quality of any new products  differentiation of new products from those of our competitors  market acceptance of our products and our customers products  and availability of adequate quantity and configurations of various types of memory products 
our strategy is to utilize the most advanced semiconductor process technology appropriate for our products and available from commercial third party foundries 
use of advanced processes has in the past resulted in initial yield problems 
new products that we introduce may not incorporate the features and functionality demanded by pc oems  add in board and motherboard manufacturers and consumers of d graphics 
in addition  we may not successfully develop or introduce new products in sufficient volumes within the appropriate time to meet both the pc oems design cycles and market demand 
we have in the past experienced delays in the development of some new products 
our failure to successfully develop  introduce or achieve market acceptance for new d graphics products would harm our business 
in particular  we experienced delays in the introduction of graphics processors using our next generation technology during the second half of fiscal and any such delays in the future or failure of these or other processors to meet or exceed specifications of competitive products could materially harm our business 
our failure to identify new product opportunities or develop new products could harm our business 
as our d graphics processors develop and competition increases  we anticipate that product life cycles at the high end will remain short and average selling prices will continue to decline 
in particular  we expect average selling prices and gross margins for our d graphics processors to decline as each product matures and as unit volume increases 
as a result  we will need to introduce new products and enhancements to existing products to maintain overall average selling prices and gross margins 
in order for our d graphics processors to achieve high volumes  leading pc oems and add in board and motherboard manufacturers must select our d graphics processor for design into their products  and then successfully complete the designs of their products and sell them 
we may be unable to successfully identify new product opportunities or to develop and bring to market in a timely fashion new products 
in addition  we cannot guarantee that new products we develop will be selected for design into pc oems and add in board and motherboard manufacturers products  that any new designs will be successfully completed or that any new products will be sold 
as the complexity of our products and the manufacturing process for products increases  there is an increasing risk that we will experience problems with the performance of products and that there will be delays in the development  introduction or volume shipment of our products 
we may experience difficulties related to the production of current or future products or other factors may delay the introduction or volume sale of new products we developed 
in addition  we may be unable to successfully manage the production transition risks with respect to future products 
failure to achieve any of the foregoing with respect to future products or product enhancements could result in rapidly declining average selling prices  reduced margins and reduced demand for products or loss of market share 
in addition  technologies developed by others may render our d graphics products non competitive or obsolete or result in our holding excess inventory  any of which would harm our business 
we could suffer a loss of market share if our products contain significant defects 
products as complex as those offered by us may contain defects or failures when introduced or when new versions or enhancements to existing products are released 
we have in the past discovered defects and incompatibilities with customers hardware in certain of our products and may experience delays or loss of revenue to correct any new defects in the future 
errors in new products or releases after commencement of commercial shipments could result in loss of market share or failure to achieve market acceptance 
our products typically go through only one verification cycle prior to beginning volume production and distribution 
as a result  our products may contain defects or flaws that are undetected prior to volume production and distribution 

table of contents if these defects or flaws exist and are not detected prior to volume production and distribution  we may be required to reimburse customers for costs to repair or replace the affected products in the field 
these costs could be significant and could adversely affect our business and operating results 
failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for existing and or new products would reduce our gross margins 
semiconductor manufacturing yields are a function both of product design  which is developed largely by us  and process technology  which typically is proprietary to the manufacturer 
since low yields may result from either design or process technology failures  yield problems may not be effectively determined or resolved until an actual product exists that can be analyzed and tested to identify process sensitivities relating to the design rules that are used 
as a result  yield problems may not be identified until well into the production process  and resolution of yield problems would require cooperation by and communication between us and the manufacturer 
the risk of low yields is compounded by the offshore location of most of our manufacturers  increasing the effort and time required to identify  communicate and resolve manufacturing yield problems 
because of our potentially limited access to wafer fabrication capacity from our manufacturers  any decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in our per unit costs and force us to allocate our available product supply among our customers 
this could potentially harm customer relationships  as well as revenue and gross profit 
our wafer manufacturers may be unable to achieve or maintain acceptable manufacturing yields in the future 
our inability to achieve planned yields from our wafer manufacturers could harm our business 
we also face the risk of product recalls or product returns resulting from design or manufacturing defects that are not discovered during the manufacturing and testing process 
in the event of a significant number of product returns due to a defect or recall  our business could suffer 
failure to transition to new manufacturing process technologies could affect our ability to compete effectively 
our strategy is to utilize the most advanced process technology appropriate for our products and available from commercial third party foundries 
use of advanced processes may have greater risk of initial yield problems 
manufacturing process technologies are subject to rapid change and require significant expenditures for research and development 
we continuously evaluate the benefits of migrating to smaller geometry process technologies in order to improve performance and reduce costs 
we currently use micron process technology for the geforce  quadro  geforce  quadro dcc  xbox and nforce families of graphics processors  and we believe that the transition of our products to increasingly smaller geometries will be important to our competitive position 
in november  we introduced our newest flagship gpu  the geforce fx ultra  which is our first gpu to be manufactured in micron process technology 
other companies in the industry have experienced difficulty in migrating to new manufacturing processes and  consequently  have suffered reduced yields  delays in product deliveries and increased expense levels 
we have experienced and may continue to experience similar difficulties and the corresponding negative effects 
moreover  we are dependent on our relationships with our third party manufacturers to migrate to smaller geometry processes successfully 
we may be unable to migrate to new manufacturing process technologies successfully or on a timely basis 
we may be unable to manage our growth and  as a result  may be unable to successfully implement our strategy 
our rapid growth has placed  and is expected to continue to place  a significant strain on our managerial  operational and financial resources 
as of january   we had  employees as compared to  employees as of january  we expect that the number of our employees will increase over the next months 
our future growth  if any  will depend on our ability to continue to implement and improve operational  financial and management information and control systems on a timely basis  as well as our ability to maintain effective cost controls 
further  we will be required to manage multiple relationships with various customers and other third parties 
our systems  procedures or controls may not be adequate to support our operations and our management may be unable to achieve the rapid execution necessary to successfully implement our strategy 

table of contents we are dependent on key personnel and the loss of these employees could harm our business 
our performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees 
none of our officers or employees is bound by an employment agreement  and so our relationships with these officers and employees are at will 
we do not have key person life insurance policies on any of our employees 
the loss of the services of any of our executive officers  technical personnel or other key employees  particularly jen hsun huang  our president and chief executive officer  would harm our business 
our success will depend on our ability to identify  hire  train and retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel 
our failure to attract and retain the necessary technical and managerial personnel would harm our business 
we are subject to risks associated with international operations which may harm our business 
our reliance on foreign third party manufacturing  assembly  testing and packaging operations subjects us to a number of risks associated with conducting business outside of the united states  including the following unexpected changes in  or impositions of  legislative or regulatory requirements  delays resulting from difficulty in obtaining export licenses for certain technology  tariffs  quotas and other trade barriers and restrictions  longer payment cycles  imposition of additional taxes and penalties  the burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  and other factors beyond our control  including terrorism and war  which may delay the shipment of our products 
we also are subject to general political risks in connection with our international trade relationships 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold  including various countries in asia  may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
this makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely 
currently  all of our arrangements with third party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in us dollars  and to date we have not engaged in any currency hedging activities  although we may do so in the future 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates could harm our business in the future 
hostilities involving the united states and or terrorist attacks could harm our business 
the financial  political  economic and other uncertainties following the terrorist attacks upon the united states have led to a weakening of the global economy 
recent economic data  such as the united states unemployment rate and consumer confidence measures  appear to indicate that international hostilities involving the united states has further weakened the global economy 
the reduction in business and investor confidence is also reflected in the weakening equity markets 
subsequent terrorist acts and or the threat of future outbreak or continued escalation of hostilities involving the united states or other countries could adversely affect the growth rate of our revenue and have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  any escalation in these events or similar future events may disrupt our operations or those of our customers  distributors and suppliers  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
failure in operation or future enhancement or implementation of our enterprise resource planning system could harm our operations 
during fiscal  we initiated an examination of sap ag  our current enterprise resource planning  or erp  system to enhance our information systems in business  finance  operations and service 
during fiscal  we implemented certain additional functionalities based upon the results of the erp examination and we expect 
table of contents to implement additional functionalities in fiscal if we are not able to implement additional functionalities to our current erp system or there are delays or downtime as a result of the implementation  the efficiency of our business applications and business operations could be harmed 
we are heavily dependent upon the proper functioning of our internal systems to conduct our business 
system failure or malfunctioning may result in disruptions of operations and inability to process transactions 
our results of operations and financial position could be harmed if we encounter unforeseen problems with respect to system operations or future implementations 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation  our bylaws and our agreement with microsoft could delay or prevent a change in control 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
these provisions include the following the ability of the board of directors to create and issue preferred stock without prior stockholder approval  the prohibition of stockholder action by written consent  a classified board of directors  and advance notice requirements for director nominations and stockholder proposals 
on march   we entered into an agreement with microsoft in which we agreed to develop and sell graphics chips and to license certain technology to microsoft and its licensees for use in the xbox 
in the event that an individual or corporation makes an offer to purchase shares equal to or greater than of the outstanding shares of our common stock  microsoft has first and last rights of refusal to purchase the stock 
the provision could also delay or prevent a change in control of nvidia 
we may not be able to realize the potential financial or strategic benefits of business acquisitions and that could hurt our ability to grow our business and sell our products 
in the past we have acquired and invested in other businesses that offered products  services and technologies that we believed would help expand or enhance our products and services or help expand our distribution channels 
for any previous or future acquisition or investment  the following risks could impair our ability to grow our business and develop new products and  ultimately  could impair our ability to sell our products difficulty in combining the technology  operations or workforce of the acquired business  disruption of our ongoing businesses  difficulty in realizing the potential financial or strategic benefits of the transaction  difficulty in maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  and possible impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new businesses and management personnel 
in addition  the consideration for any future acquisition could be paid in cash  shares of our common stock  or a combination of cash and common stock 
if the consideration is paid with our common stock  existing stockholders would be further diluted 
risks related to our partners we are dependent on a small number of customers and we are subject to order and shipment uncertainties 
we have only a limited number of customers and our sales are highly concentrated 
we primarily sell our products to add in board and motherboard manufacturers and cems  which incorporate graphics products in the 
table of contents boards they sell to pc oems and system builders 
sales to add in board and motherboard manufacturers and cems are primarily dependent on achieving design wins with leading pc oems 
the number of add in board and motherboard manufacturers  cems and leading pc oems is limited 
we expect that a small number of add in board and motherboard manufacturers and cems directly  and a small number of pc oems indirectly  will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
as a result  our business could be harmed by the loss of business from pc oems or add in board and motherboard manufacturers and cems 
in addition  revenue from add in board and motherboard manufacturers  cems and pc oems that have directly or indirectly accounted for significant revenue in past periods  individually or as a group  may not continue  or may not reach or exceed historical levels in any future period 
our business may be harmed by instability in asia due to the concentration of customers who are located or have substantial operations in asia  including taiwan 
the people s republic of china and taiwan have in the past experienced strained relations 
a worsening of these relationships or the development of hostilities between the two could result in disruptions in taiwan and possibly other areas of asia  which could harm our business 
in addition  if relations between the us and the people s republic of china become strained  our business could be harmed 
while we believe political instability in asia has not harmed our business  because of our reliance on companies with operations in asia  continued economic and political instability in asia might harm it 
difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could result in significant charges against income  which could harm our business 
our accounts receivable are highly concentrated and make us vulnerable to adverse changes in our customers businesses and to downturns in the economy and the industry 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure  excluding the amounts covered by credit insurance 
if the financial condition of our customers or insurance carrier were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required which could adversely affect our operating results 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that we will be able to attain credit insurance in the future 
we may have to record additional reserves or write offs in the future  which could harm our business 
we rely on third party vendors to supply us tools for the development of our new products and we may be unable to obtain the tools necessary to develop these products 
in the design and development of new products and product enhancements  we rely on third party software development tools 
while we currently are not dependent on any one vendor for the supply of these tools  some or all of these tools may not be readily available in the future 
for example  we have experienced delays in the introduction of products in the past as a result of the inability of then available software development tools to fully simulate the complex features and functionalities of our products 
the design requirements necessary to meet consumer demands for more features and greater functionality from d graphics products in the future may exceed the capabilities of the software development tools available to us 
if the software development tools we use become unavailable or fail to produce designs that meet consumer demands  our business could suffer 
there can be no assurance that the xbox program will achieve long term commercial success 
there can be no assurance that the xbox program will achieve long term commercial success  given the high level of competition in the game console product line 
during fiscal  sales of xbox processors comprised of our overall revenue 
if the xbox program is not successful  our business may be harmed 
we depend on foreign foundries and independent contractors to manufacture our products and these third parties may not be able to satisfy our manufacturing requirements  which would harm our business 
we do not manufacture the semiconductor wafers used for our products and do not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility 
our products require wafers manufactured with state of the art fabrication equipment and techniques 
we primarily utilize tsmc to produce our semiconductor wafers and utilize independent 
table of contents subcontractors to perform assembly  testing and packaging 
we depend on these suppliers to allocate to us a portion of their manufacturing capacity sufficient to meet our needs  to produce products of acceptable quality and at acceptable manufacturing yields  and to deliver those products to us on a timely basis 
these manufacturers may be unable to meet our near term or long term manufacturing requirements 
we obtain manufacturing services on a purchase order basis and tsmc has no obligation to provide us with any specified minimum quantities of product 
tsmc fabricates wafers for other companies  including certain of our competitors  and could choose to prioritize capacity for other users or reduce or eliminate deliveries to us on short notice 
because the lead time needed to establish a strategic relationship with a new manufacturing partner could be several quarters  there is no readily available alternative source of supply for any specific product 
we believe that long term market acceptance for our products will depend on reliable relationships with tsmc and any other manufacturers used by us to ensure adequate product supply to respond to customer demand 
our wafer requirements represent a significant portion of the total production capacity of tsmc 
although our products are designed using tsmc s process design rules  tsmc may be unable to achieve or maintain acceptable yields or deliver sufficient quantities of wafers on a timely basis and or at an acceptable cost 
additionally  tsmc may not continue to devote resources to the production of our products  or to advance the process design technologies on which the manufacturing of our products are based 
any difficulties like these would harm our business 
because of our reliance on tsmc  our business may be harmed by political instability in taiwan  including the worsening of the strained relations between the people s republic of china and taiwan  or if relations between the us and the people s republic of china are strained due to foreign relations events 
furthermore  any substantial disruption in our suppliers operations  either as a result of a natural disaster  political unrest  economic instability  acts of terrorism or war  equipment failure or other cause  could harm our business 
there can be no assurance that ibm will be able to produce wafers of acceptable quality and with acceptable manufacturing yield and deliver those wafers to us and our independent assembly and testing subcontractors on a timely basis 
on march   we announced that we have formed a multi year strategic alliance under which ibm will manufacture our next generation geforce gpus 
as part of the agreement  we will gain access to ibm s suite of foundry services and manufacturing technologies  including power efficient copper wiring  and a roadmap that is designed to lead to nm nanometer  a billionth of a meter in the next several years  giving us valuable tools to advance our gpus 
ibm plans to begin manufacturing the next generation geforce graphics processor this summer at ibm s plant in east fishkill  new york 
during the development of our relationship with ibm  our manufacturing yields and product performance could suffer due to difficulties associated with adapting our technology and product design to the proprietary process technology and design rules of ibm 
any decrease in manufacturing yields could result in an increase in our per unit costs and force us to allocate our available product supply among our customers 
this could potentially harm customer relationships as well as revenue and gross profit 
we also face the risk of product recalls or product returns resulting from design or manufacturing defects that are not discovered during the manufacturing and testing process 
in the event of a significant number of product returns due to a defect or recall  our business could suffer 
we are dependent on third parties for assembly  testing and packaging of our products 
our graphics processors are assembled and tested by siliconware precision industries company ltd  amkor technology  chippac incorporated and advanced semiconductor engineering 
we do not have long term agreements with any of these subcontractors 
as a result of our dependence on third party subcontractors for assembly  testing and packaging of our products  we do not directly control product delivery schedules or product quality 
any product shortages or quality assurance problems could increase the costs of manufacture  assembly or testing of our products and could harm our business 
due to the amount of time 
table of contents typically required to qualify assemblers and testers  we could experience significant delays in the shipment of our products if we are required to find alternative third parties to assemble or test our products or components 
any delays in delivery of our products could harm our business 
risks related to our competition the d graphics industry is highly competitive and we may be unable to compete 
the market for d graphics processors for pcs in which we compete is intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards and declining average selling prices 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in this market are performance  breadth of product offerings  access to customers and distribution channels  backward forward software support  conformity to industry standard apis  manufacturing capabilities  price of graphics processors and total system costs of add in boards and motherboards 
we expect competition to increase both from existing competitors and new market entrants with products that may be less costly than our d graphics processors  or may provide better performance or additional features not provided by our products 
we may be unable to compete successfully in the emerging pc graphics market 
our primary source of competition is from companies that provide or intend to provide d graphics solutions for the pc market 
our competitors include the following suppliers of integrated core logic chipsets that incorporate d graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions  such as intel  silicon integrated systems  ati technologies inc and via technologies  inc  suppliers of graphics add in boards that utilize their internally developed graphics chips  such as ati technologies inc  creative technology and matrox electronics systems ltd  suppliers of mobile graphics processors that incorporate d graphics functionality as part of their existing solutions  such as ati technologies inc  trident microsystems  inc 
and the joint venture of a division of sonicblue incorporated formerly s incorporated and via technologies  inc  and companies that have traditionally focused on the professional market and provide high end d solutions for pcs and workstations  including dlabs a creative technology company and ati technologies inc if and to the extent we offer products outside of the d graphics processor market  we may face competition from some of our existing competitors as well as from companies with which we currently do not compete 
we cannot accurately predict if we will compete successfully in any new markets we may enter 
we may not successfully compete with intel in the integrated chipset product line 
it is projected by analysts that integrated chipsets are likely to become a majority share of the pc graphics market 
we have recently introduced and begun shipment of the nforce platform processor  our second generation integrated d graphics chipset 
the nforce platform processor is initially designed to support microprocessors produced by amd 
intel is the dominant supplier of integrated d graphics chipsets 
intel has significantly greater resources than we do  and the nforce platform processor  or other d graphics products that we may introduce  may not compete effectively against intel s current chipset products or its future products  either in terms of price or performance 
in addition  due to the widespread industry acceptance of intel s microprocessor architecture and interface architecture  including its accelerated graphics port architecture  or agp  intel exercises significant influence over the pc industry and over companies developing products for such architecture 
any significant modifications by intel to the agp  the microprocessor or core logic components or other aspects of the pc microprocessor architecture could result in incompatibility with our technology  which would harm our business 

table of contents in addition  any delay in the public release of information relating to modifications like this could harm our business 
in addition to its influence over the pc architecture  intel has asserted intellectual property rights in various pc architecture interfaces 
for example  as a result of patents held by intel  it has asserted that companies wishing to develop a chipset compatible with the pentium microprocessor or similar microprocessors obtain a license from intel 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in the market are performance  breadth of product offerings  access to customers and distribution channels  backward forward software support  conformity to industry standard apis  manufacturing capabilities  price of graphics processors and total system costs of add in boards and motherboards 
in september intel filed a patent infringement suit against via technologies  inc with respect to a via technologies  inc 
chipset for the pentium we do not have a license from intel for such a chipset 
we expect intel to continue to do the following invest heavily in research and development and continue development of integrated d graphics products  maintain its position as the largest manufacturer of pc microprocessors  use its intellectual property position with respect to the pc microprocessor and architecture to defend its position in d graphics  including the filing of patent infringement suits against competitors  follow business practices in its pc business  which strongly encourage use of intel integrated chipsets  increasingly dominate the pc platform  and promote its product offerings through advertising campaigns designed to engender brand loyalty among pc users 
our failure to achieve one or more design wins would harm our business 
our future success will depend in large part on achieving design wins  which entails having our existing and future products chosen as the d graphics processors for hardware components or subassemblies designed by pc oems and add in board and motherboard manufacturers 
our add in board and motherboard manufacturers and major oem customers typically introduce new system configurations as often as twice per year  generally based on spring and fall design cycles 
accordingly  our existing products must have competitive performance levels or we must timely introduce new products with such performance characteristics in order to be included in new system configurations 
our failure to achieve one or more design wins would harm our business 
the process of being qualified for inclusion in a pc oem s product can be lengthy and could cause us to miss a cycle in the demand of end users for a particular product feature  which also could harm our business 
our ability to achieve design wins also depends in part on our ability to identify and ensure compliance with evolving industry standards 
unanticipated changes in industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major hardware manufacturers and software developers  including intel and microsoft 
this would require us to invest significant time and resources to redesign our products to ensure compliance with relevant standards 
if our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards for a significant period of time  our ability to achieve design wins could suffer 
risks related to financial and market conditions we are dependent on the pc market and the slowdown in its growth has and may in the future have a negative impact on our business 
during fiscal  we derived most of our revenue from the sale of products for use in the desktop pc market  from professional workstations to low cost pcs 
we expect to continue to derive most of our revenue from the sale or license of products for use in the desktop pc market in the next several years 
the pc market is 
table of contents characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions and significant price competition 
these factors result in short product life cycles and regular reductions of average selling prices over the life of a specific product 
a reduction in sales of pcs  or a reduction in the growth rate of pc sales  will reduce demand for our products 
moreover  changes in demand could be large and sudden 
since pc manufacturers often build inventories during periods of anticipated growth  they may be left with excess inventories if growth slows or if they have incorrectly forecast product transitions 
in these cases  pc manufacturers may abruptly suspend substantially all purchases of additional inventory from suppliers like us until the excess inventory has been absorbed 
the slowing of both the domestic and international economy has led to a reduction in the demand for pcs and to a reduction in inventory purchases by pc manufacturers  which adversely impacted our revenue during fiscal any continued reduction in the demand for pcs generally  or for a particular product that incorporates our d graphic processors  could harm our business 
the acceptance of next generation products in business pc d graphics may not continue to develop 
our success will depend in part upon the demand for performance d graphics for business pc applications 
the market for performance d graphics on business pcs has only recently begun to emerge and is dependent on the future development of  and substantial end user and oem demand for  d graphics functionality 
as a result  the market for business pc d graphics computing may not continue to develop or may not grow at a rate sufficient to support our business 
the development of the market for performance d graphics in business pcs will in turn depend on the development and availability of a large number of business pc software applications that support or take advantage of performance d graphics capabilities 
currently  there are only a limited number of software applications like this  most of which are games  and a broader base of software applications may not develop in the near term or at all 
consequently  a broad market for full function performance d graphics on business pcs may not develop 
our business prospects will suffer if the market for business pc d graphics fails to develop or develops more slowly than expected 
our d graphics solution may not continue to be accepted by the pc market 
our success will depend in part upon continued broad adoption of our d graphics processors for high performance d graphics in pc applications 
the market for d graphics processors has been characterized by unpredictable and sometimes rapid shifts in the popularity of products  often caused by the publication of competitive industry benchmark results  changes in dynamic random memory devices pricing and other changes in the total system cost of add in boards  as well as by severe price competition and by frequent new technology and product introductions 
only a small number of products have achieved broad market acceptance and such market acceptance  if achieved  is difficult to sustain due to intense competition 
since the pc market is our core business  our business would suffer if for any reason our current or future d graphics processors do not continue to achieve widespread acceptance in the pc market 
if we are unable to complete the timely development of products  or if we were unable to successfully and cost effectively manufacture and deliver products that meet the requirements of the pc market  our business would be harmed 
the semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and an industry downturn could harm our business 
the semiconductor industry historically has been characterized by the following factors rapid technological change  cyclical market patterns  significant average selling price erosion  fluctuating inventory levels  alternating periods of overcapacity and capacity constraints  and variations in manufacturing costs and yields and significant expenditures for capital equipment and product development 

table of contents in addition  the industry has experienced significant economic downturns at various times  characterized by diminished product demand and accelerated erosion of average selling prices 
we may experience substantial period to period fluctuations in results of operations due to general semiconductor industry conditions 
our stock price may continue to experience significant short term fluctuations 
the price of our common stock has fluctuated greatly 
these price fluctuations have been rapid and severe 
the price of our common stock may continue to fluctuate greatly in the future due to factors that are non company specific  such as the decline in the us economy  acts of terror against the us  war or due to a variety of company specific factors  including quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  shortfalls in revenue or earnings from levels expected by securities analysts and the other factors discussed above in these risk factors 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s stock  securities class action litigation has been initiated against the issuing company 
since february  multiple securities class action lawsuits and several derivative suits have been filed against us 
we expect that this litigation  whether or not resolved favorably  may result in substantial cost and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which could harm our revenues and earnings 
any adverse determination in this litigation could also subject us to significant liabilities 
see legal proceedings and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of this litigation 
we are exposed to fluctuations in the market values of our portfolio investments and in interest rates 
for additional information regarding risks associated with the market value of portfolio investments and interest rates  see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
risks related to intellectual property  litigation and government action our industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights or positions that could result in substantial costs to us 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights and positions  which has resulted in protracted and expensive litigation 
the d graphics market in particular has been characterized recently by the aggressive pursuit of intellectual property positions  and we expect our competitors to continue to pursue aggressive intellectual property positions 
in addition  from time to time we receive notices or are included in legal actions alleging that we have infringed patents or other intellectual property rights owned by third parties 
we expect that  as the number of issued hardware and software patents increases  and as competition in our product lines intensifies  the volume of intellectual property infringement claims may increase 
if infringement claims are made against us  we may seek licenses under the claimants patents or other intellectual property rights 
however  licenses may not be offered at all or on terms acceptable to us  particularly by competitors 
the failure to obtain a license from a third party for technology used by us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and to suspend the manufacture of and sale of one or more products  which could reduce our revenues and harm our business 
furthermore  we may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our proprietary rights 
we have agreed to indemnify certain customers for claims of infringement arising out of sale of our products 
litigation against us or our customers concerning infringement would likely result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel 
we are currently subject to claims of patent infringement  and we may be subject to patent infringement claims or suits brought by other parties in the future 
we do not believe that current actions will have a material impact on our business or financial condition 
however  these claims and any future lawsuits could divert our resources and result in the payment of substantial damages 

table of contents our ability to compete will be harmed if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property 
we rely primarily on a combination of patents  trademarks  trade secrets  employee and third party nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements to protect our intellectual property
