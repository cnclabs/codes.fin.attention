item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk a change in the relationship with any one of our major customers would materially adversely affect our business 
a small number of customers has historically accounted for a majority of our net revenues in any given fiscal period 
for the fiscal years ended december   and  aggregate sales to our top two restaurant segment customers  mcdonald s and yum brands  amounted to  and  respectively  of net revenues 
no customer is obligated to make any minimum level of future purchases from us or to provide us with binding forecasts of product purchases for any future period 
in addition  major customers may elect to delay or otherwise change the timing of orders in a manner that could adversely effect quarterly and annual results of operations 
there can be no assurance that our current customers will continue to place orders with us  or that we will be able to obtain orders from new customers 
an inabiility to produce new products that keep pace with technological developments and changing market conditions could result in a loss of market share 
the products we sell are subject to rapid and continual technological change 
the products that are available from our competitors have increasingly offered a wider range of features and capabilities 
we believe that in order to compete effectively we must provide compatible systems incorporating new technologies at competitive prices 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue funding research and development at levels sufficient to enhance our current product offerings  or will be able to develop and introduce on a timely basis new products that keep pace with technological developments and emerging industry standards and address the evolving needs of customers 
there can also be no assurance that we will not experience difficulties that will result in delaying or preventing the successful development  introduction and marketing of new products in our existing markets  or that our new products and product enhancements will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace or achieve any significant degree of market acceptance 
likewise  there can be no assurance as to the acceptance of our products in new markets  nor can there be any assurance as to the success of our penetration of these markets  or to the revenue or profit margins with respect to these products 
if any of our competitors were to introduce superior software products at competitive prices  or if our software products no longer met the needs of the marketplace due to technological developments and emerging industry standards  our software products may no longer retain any significant market share 
if this were to occur  we could be required to record a charge against capitalized software costs  which amounts to million as of december  we derive a portion of our revenue from government contracts  which contain provisions unique to public sector customers 
for the fiscal years ended december   and  we derived  and  respectively  of our net revenues from contracts to provide technical products and services to united states government agencies and defense contractors 
contracts with united states government agencies typically provide that such contracts are terminable at the convenience of the government 
if the government terminated a contract on this basis  we would be entitled to receive payment for our allowable costs and  in general  a proportionate share of our fee or profit for work actually performed 
most us government contracts are also subject to modification or termination in the event of changes in funding 
as such  we may perform work prior to formal authorization  or the contract prices may be adjusted for increased work scope or change orders 
termination or modification of a substantial number of our us government contracts could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company does not anticipate any impact due to the current world crisis on our current contracts 
we face extensive competition in the markets in which we operate  and our failure to compete effectively could result in price reductions and decreased demand for our products and services 
there are currently five major suppliers who offer restaurant management systems similar to ours 
some of these competitors are larger than we are and have access to substantially greater financial and other resources than we do  and consequently may be able to obtain more favorable terms than we can for components and subassemblies incorporated into their restaurant technology products 
the rapid rate of technological change in the restaurant market makes it likely that we will face competition from new products designed by companies not currently competing with us 
such products may have features not currently available on our restaurant products 
we believe that our competitive ability depends on our total solution offering  our product development and systems integration capability  our direct sales force and our customer service organization 
there is no assurance  however  that we will be able to compete effectively in the restaurant technology market in the future 
our government contracting business has been focused on niche offerings  primarily signal and image processing and engineering services 
many of our competitors are  or are subsidiaries of  companies such as lockheed martin  raytheon  northrop grumman which includes litton prc tasc  bae  boeing and saic 
these companies are larger and have substantially greater financial resources than we do 
we also compete with smaller companies that target particular segments of the government market 
these companies may be better positioned to obtain contracts through competitive proposals 
consequently  there are no assurances that we will continue to win government contracts as a prime contractor or subcontractor 
we may not be able to meet the unique operational  legal and financial challenges that relate to our international operations  which may limit the growth of our business 
for the years ended december   and  our net revenues from sales outside the united states were  and  respectively  of the company s net revenues 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of sales 
we intend to continue to expand our operations outside the united states and to enter additional international markets  which will require significant management attention and financial resources 
our operating results are subject to the risks inherent in international sales  including  but not limited to  regulatory requirements  political and economic changes and disruptions  geopolitical disputes and war  transportation delays  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign sales operations  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
in addition  fluctuations in exchange rates may render our products less competitive relative to local product offerings  or could result in foreign exchange losses  depending upon the currency in which we sell our products 
there can be no assurance that these factors will not have a material adverse effect on our future international sales and  consequently  on our operating results 
in  less than of the company s revenues was from customers in the middle east 
therefore  the current world crisis is not expected to have a material impact on the results of operations in inflation inflation had little effect on revenues and related costs during management anticipates that margins will be maintained at acceptable levels to minimize the effects of inflation  if any 
interest rates as of december   the company has million in variable long term debt and million in variable short term debt 
the company believes that a change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our business  financial conditions  results of operations or cash flows 
foreign currency the company s primary exposures relate to certain non dollar denominated sales and operating expenses in europe and asia 
these primary currencies are the euro  the australian dollar and the singapore dollar 
management believes that foreign currency fluctuations should not have a significant impact on gross margins due to the low volume of business affected by foreign currencies
