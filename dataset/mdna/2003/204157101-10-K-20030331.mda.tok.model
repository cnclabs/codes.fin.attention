introduction this discussion is designed to provide insight into management s assessment of significant trends related to the company s consolidated financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital resources and interest rate sensitivity 
it should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report 
factors that may affect future results of operations economic conditions nationally  the banking industry and the company have been affected by the steady growth in the economy and the actions of the federal reserve board to manage this growth by cutting interest rates to the lowest levels in over years 
the changes in interest rates have impacted the company as market rates for loans  investments and deposits are near an all time low 
goleta serves three primary regions 
the tri counties region which consists of san luis obispo  santa barbara and ventura counties in the state of california  the sba western region where goleta originates sba loans california  washington  nevada and colorado and the sba southeast region georgia  florida  tennessee  alabama  north carolina and south carolina 
the forecast for the tri counties area is positive for the coming years  but california has its own unique problems  as budget and energy problems have discouraged business investment in california and slowed economic growth 
goleta s sba western region has experienced modest growth 
non planned retail expenditures should remain weak 
in addition  no significant economic growth is anticipated for some time 
the economy relative to our sba southeast region continues to remain sluggish 
also impacting the company is the nation s slow recovery in the tourism and hospitality sectors from the tragedy of september  regulatory considerations the financial services industry is heavily regulated 
the company is subject to federal and state regulation designed to protect the deposits of consumers  not to benefit shareholders 
these regulations include the following the amount of capital the company must maintain the types of activities in which it can engage the types and amounts of investments it can make the locations of its offices how much interest goleta can pay on demand deposits insurance of the company s deposits and the premiums paid for this insurance how much cash the company must set aside as reserves for deposits the regulations impose significant limitations on operations and may be changed at any time  possibly causing future results to vary significantly from past results 
government policy and regulation  particularly as implemented through the federal reserve system  significantly affects credit conditions 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations supervision and regulation 
consent order in march  goleta entered into the formal agreement with its principal regulator  the office of the comptroller of the currency occ 
in october of  goleta entered into a stipulation for the entry of a consent order consent order with the occ 
as of this date  the consent order replaced the formal agreement that goleta was previously under with the occ 
the consent order requires that goleta maintain certain capital levels  adhere to certain operational and reporting requirements  and take certain actions which could limit goleta s business activity and increase expense 
the failure to fully comply with the consent order requirements could adversely affect the safety or soundness of goleta 
the occ possesses broad powers to take corrective and other supervisory action and bring enforcement actions to resolve unsafe or unsound practices 
the company believes that it is in substantial compliance with the consent order 
see supervision and regulation consent order with the occ 
memorandum of understanding in march  cwbc entered into a memorandum of understanding mou with its principal regulator  the federal reserve bank of san francisco 
the mou requires the company to maintain certain capital levels as well as adhere to certain operational and regulatory requirements 
compliance with the requirements of the mou could limit the company s business activity and or increase costs 
the company believes that it is in substantial compliance with the mou 
see supervision and regulation memorandum of understanding with the federal reserve bank 
bank regulations could discourage changes in the company s ownership bank regulations could delay or discourage a potential acquirer who might have been willing to pay a premium price to acquire a large block of common stock 
that possibility could decrease the value of the company s common stock and the price that a stockholder will receive if shares are sold in the future 
before anyone can buy enough voting stock to exercise control over a bank holding company like cwbc  bank regulators must approve the acquisition 
a stockholder must apply for regulatory approval to own percent or more of the company s common stock  unless the stockholder can show that they will not actually exert control over the company 
regardless  no stockholder can own more than percent of the company s common stock without applying for regulatory approval 
the company does not expect to pay dividends the company intends to reinvest earnings into its business rather than pay dividends on its common stock for the foreseeable future 
additionally  cwbc would need the approval of the federal reserve bank under the terms of the company s mou to pay dividends to its stockholders 
one source of funds for the payment of dividends by cwbc would be from dividends paid by goleta to cwbc 
goleta s ability to pay dividends to cwbc is limited by california law  federal banking law  and the terms of goleta s consent order with the occ 
see supervision and regulation consent order with the occ and memorandum of understanding with the federal reserve bank 
the price of the company s common stock may change rapidly and significantly the market price of the company s common stock could change rapidly and significantly at any time 
the market price of the company s common stock has fluctuated in recent years 
between january  and december   the closing market price of its common stock ranged from a low of per share to a high of per share 
fluctuations may occur  among other reasons  in response to short term or long term operating results regulatory action or adverse publicity perceived value of the company s loan portfolio trends in the company s nonperforming assets or the nonperforming assets of other financial institutions announcements by competitors economic changes general market conditions perceived strength of the banking industry in general legislative and regulatory changes the trading price of the company s common stock may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations in response to the factors set forth above and other factors  many of which are beyond the company s control 
the stock market in recent years has experienced extreme price and trading volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of individual companies 
the company believes that investors should consider the likelihood of these market fluctuations before investing in the company s common stock 
dependence on real estate approximately of the loan portfolio of the company is secured by various forms of real estate  including residential and commercial real estate 
a decline in current economic conditions or rising interest rates could have an adverse effect on the demand for new loans  the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans and the value of real estate and other collateral securing loans 
the real estate securing the company s loan portfolio is concentrated in california 
if real estate values decline significantly  especially in california  higher vacancies and other factors could harm the financial condition of the company s borrowers  the collateral for its loans will provide less security  and the company would be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans 
curtailment of government guaranteed loan programs could effect an important segment of the company s business a major segment of the company s business consists of originating and selling government guaranteed loans  in particular those guaranteed by the small business administration 
from time to time  the government agencies that guarantee these loans reach their internal limits and cease to guarantee loans for a stated time period 
in addition  these agencies may change their rules for loans or congress may adopt legislation that would have the effect of discontinuing or changing the programs 
non governmental programs could replace government programs for some borrowers  but the terms might not be equally acceptable 
therefore  if these changes occur  the volume of loans to small business  industrial and agricultural borrowers of the types that now qualify for government guaranteed loans could decline 
also  the profitability of these loans could decline 
environmental laws could force the company to pay for environmental problems when a borrower defaults on a loan secured by real property  the company often purchases the property in foreclosure or accepts a deed to the property surrendered by the borrower 
the company may also take over the management of commercial properties whose owners have defaulted on loans 
while goleta has guidelines intended to exclude properties with an unreasonable risk of contamination  hazardous substances may exist on some of the properties that goleta owns  manages or occupies 
the company faces the risk that environmental laws could force it to clean up the properties at the company s expense 
it may cost much more to clean a property than the property is worth 
the company could also be liable for pollution generated by a borrower s operations if the company took a role in managing those operations after default 
resale of contaminated properties may also be difficult 
overview of earnings performance in  the net loss of the company was million  or  per basic and diluted shares 
this represents a decrease from the  net income  or per basic and diluted shares  reported for return on average assets and average equity were and in  compared with returns of and for even though interest rates continued to decline in  the company s net interest income after provision for loan losses increased in by million  or 
this increase was primarily due to a reduction in the provision for loan losses of million  or  for which was the result of increased credit quality gained from the company s exit from higher risk lending activities as well as the company s overall tightening of credit underwriting standards 
despite these increases  the company s net income decreased by million  primarily due to a  or million  decrease in other income 
approximately million of this decline relates to the legal settlement proceeds received in the other million decline in other income is primarily due to a million decrease in net gains from loan sales and various small decreases in other loan fees  document processing fees  net loan servicing and other income 
throughout  the company made significant changes in its business lines by exiting both hltv and stcl and consolidating its sba and mortgage lending operations into the company s headquarters 
these changes  as well as ongoing cost cutting efforts  resulted in a decrease in non interest expenses by million  or 
the company s net income declined million  or per basic share and per diluted share  from to the primary reasons for this decline were the declines in interest rates during and the additional loan loss provision necessary to address the credit quality issues resulting from a slowdown in the economy 
an increase in prepayment speed assumptions of sold loans also caused the company to record million in amortization and or writedowns of its servicing and interest only assets 
these adverse factors were partially offset by the million net proceeds from a legal settlement with the company s former auditors 
changes in interest income and interest expense net interest income is the difference between the interest and fees earned on loans and investments and the interest expense paid on deposits and other liabilities 
the amount by which interest income will exceed interest expense depends on the volume or balance of earning assets compared to the volume or balance of interest bearing deposits and liabilities and the interest rate earned on those interest earning assets compared to the interest rate paid on those interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin is net interest income tax equivalent expressed as a percentage of average earning assets 
it is used to measure the difference between the average rate of interest earned on assets and the average rate of interest that must be paid on liabilities used to fund those assets 
to maintain its net interest margin  the company must manage the relationship between interest earned and paid

the company s income from managing assets consists of the difference between the interest income received from its loan portfolio and investments and the interest expense paid on its liabilities  primarily interest paid on deposits 
this difference or spread is net interest income 
net interest income  when expressed as a percentage of average total interest earning assets  is referred to as net interest margin on interest earning assets 
the company s net interest income is affected by the change in the level and the mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  referred to as volume changes 
the company s net yield on interest earning assets is also affected by changes in the yields earned on assets and rates paid on liabilities  referred to as rate changes 
interest rates charged on the company s loans are affected principally by the demand for such loans  the supply of money available for lending purposes  competitive factors and general economic conditions such as federal economic policies  legislative tax policies and governmental budgetary matters

non interest income increased by million from to the primary factors contributing to the increase in non interest income in were million in proceeds from a legal settlement against the company s former auditors  an  increase in document processing fees  principally in the company s mortgage origination business  and a million increase in loan origination fees  also principally in the company s mortgage origination business 
factors adversely affecting non interest income included an  reduction in the gain on sale of loans  principally in the company s sba business and a million reduction in loan servicing fees 
the reduction in loan servicing fees was principally due to an increase in the amortization and valuation adjustment of the company s sba related servicing and interest only strip assets to million in non interest expenses the following table summarizes the company s non interest expenses for the three years indicated year ended december  non interest expenses in thousands salaries and employee benefits    occupancy and depreciation    impairment of sba i and servicing assets  professional services   lower of cost or market provision  loan servicing and collection   depreciation   advertising postage and freight office supplies data and atm processing amortization of intangible assets impairment of goodwill  professional expenses associated with legal settlement  other operating expense    total non interest expenses    non interest expenses decreased by million  or  from to and increased by million or from to the decrease in was primarily due to the company s reorganization and cost cutting efforts 
salaries and employee benefits decreased by million  or  due primarily to the company s exit from hltv and stcl lending as well as consolidation of its sba support departments 
other declines in expenses include professional services by  depreciation by  loan collection by  other operating expenses by million and the million in expenses related to the legal settlement in some of this decline is attributable to palomar s million in non interest expenses included in the decreases in these expense categories were partially offset by the company s recognition of million of impairment on sba servicing and i o strip assets and a million increase in lower of cost or fair value adjustments made on the hltv loan portfolio transferred to held for sale in the third quarter of the primary factors contributing to the million increase in non interest expenses from to were million of professional expenses incurred in in connection with a legal settlement with the company s former auditors and a million increase in salaries and employee benefits  principally commission paid on sba and mortgage loans originated or brokered 
these increases were offset by the reduction in of the impairment of goodwill charge from the sale of the company s subsidiary  palomar and a reduction of million in loan servicing and collection expense  principally due to the paydown of goleta s securitized loan portfolios which are serviced by a third party

the change in effective tax rates from to is principally due to the taxable gain on sale of palomar increasing the effective tax rate and the proceeds from capital recovery  treated as a non taxable item for income tax purposes  recognized in and decreasing the effective tax rate 
the state of california does not allow a net operating loss nol carryback for tax purposes 
since the realization of this benefit in the future is not assured  the company has established a valuation allowance against the california nol tax benefit carryforward  which reduced the effective tax rate

loan portfolio the company s largest categories of loans held in the portfolio are commercial loans  real estate loans  unguaranteed portion of sba loans  installment loans and second mortgage loans 
loans are carried at face amount  net of payments collected  the allowance for loan losses  deferred loan fees costs and discounts on loans purchased 
interest on all loans is accrued daily  primarily on a simple interest basis 
it is the company s policy to place a loan on nonaccrual status when the loan is days past due 
thereafter  previously recorded interest is reversed and interest income is typically recognized on a cash basis 
the rates charged on variable rate loans are set at specific increments 
these increments vary in relation to the company s published prime lending rate or other appropriate indices 
at december   approximately of the company s loan portfolio was comprised of variable interest rate loans 
at december  and  variable rate loans comprised approximately and  respectively  of the company s loan portfolio 
management monitors the maturity of loans and the sensitivity of loans to changes in interest rates

under the terms of the revolving lines of credit  the company grants a maximum loan amount  which remains available to the business during the loan term 
as part of the loan requirements  the business agrees to maintain its primary banking relationship with the company 
it is the company s policy not to extend material loans of this type in excess of one year 
real estate loans real estate loans are primarily made for the purpose of purchasing  improving or constructing single family residences  commercial or industrial properties 
the majority of the company s mortgage loans are collateralized by liens on single family homes 
these loans are sold servicing released into the secondary market 
a large part of the company s real estate construction loans are first and second trust deeds on the construction of owner occupied single family dwellings 
the company also makes real estate construction loans on commercial properties 
these consist of first and second trust deeds collateralized by the related real property 
construction loans are generally written with terms of six to twelve months and usually do not exceed a loan to appraised value of 
commercial and industrial real estate loans are secured by nonresidential property 
office buildings or other commercial property primarily secure these loans 
loan to appraised value ratios on nonresidential real estate loans are generally restricted to of appraised value of the underlying real property 
unguaranteed portion of sba loans under the sba loan program  the company is required to retain a minimum of of the unguaranteed portion of loans it originates and sells into the secondary market 
at december   the company had million in unguaranteed sba loans 
this is an increase of million compared to december   primarily due to the increase in loan origination volume in installment loans installment loans consist of automobile  small equity lines of credit  loans secured by manufactured housing and general purpose loans made to individuals 
these loans are primarily fixed rate loans 
included in this category as of december  and are approximately million and million  respectively of the company s short term consumer lending product  which consists of day loans to individuals 
see item business lines of business short term consumer lending 
the mortgage loan center originates manufactured housing loans secured by mobile homes located in parks along the central coast of california 
at december   the bank had million in its portfolio 
the loans are serviced internally and are generally written for terms of years with balloon payments ranging from to years 
second mortgage loans the company originated second mortgage loans with loan to value ratios as high as 
in and  the company transferred million and million of these loans  respectively  to special purpose trusts trusts 
the trusts then sold bonds to third party investors  which were secured by the transferred loans 
the bonds are held in a trust independent of the company  the trustee of which oversees the distribution to the bondholders 
the mortgage loans are serviced by a third party servicer  who receives a stated servicing fee 
there is an insurance policy on the subordinate bonds that guarantees the payment of the bonds 
as part of the securitization agreements  the company received an option to repurchase the bonds when the aggregate principal balance of the mortgage loans sold declined to or less of the original balance of mortgage loans securitized 
because the company has a call option to reacquire the loans transferred and did not retain the servicing rights  the company is deemed to not have surrendered effective control over the loans transferred 
therefore  the securitizations are accounted for as secured borrowings with a pledge of collateral 
accordingly  the company consolidates the trusts and the financial statements of the company include the loans transferred and the related bonds issued 
the securitized loans are classified as held for investment 
at december  and  the net balance of the securitized loan portfolio was million and million  respectively 
the related net bond balances were million and million at december  and  respectively 
loan commitments outstanding the company s loan commitments outstanding at the dates indicated are summarized below december  in thousands commercial      real estate      sba      installment loans      standby letters of credit total commitments      the company makes loans to borrowers in a number of different industries 
other than manufactured housing  no single industry comprises or more of the company s loan portfolio 
commercial real estate loans and sba loans comprised over of the bank s loan portfolio at december   but consisted of diverse borrowers 
although the company does not have significant concentrations in its loan portfolio  the ability of the company s customers to honor their loan agreements is dependent upon  among other things  the general economy of the company s market area 
provision and allowance for loan losses the company maintains a detailed  systematic analysis and procedural discipline to determine the amount of the allowance for loan losses all 
the all is based on estimates and is intended to be adequate to provide for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
this process involves deriving probable loss estimates that are based on individual loan loss estimation  migration analysis historical loss rates and management s judgment 
the company employs several methodologies for estimating probable losses 
methodologies are determined based on a number of factors  including type of asset  credit score  concentrations  collateral value and the input of the special assets group  functioning as a workout unit 
the all calculation for the different major loan types is as follows sba all loans are reviewed and classified loans are assigned a specific allowance 
those not assigned to a watch list category are classified as pass 
a migration analysis is then used to calculate the required allowance on those pass loans 
due to gradually improving migration analysis trends by the fourth quarter of  the company was able to reduce its pass allocation 
relationship banking includes commercial and real estate mortgage loans originated by the branch locations 
classified loans are assigned a specific allowance 
a migration analysis is then used to calculate the required allowance on the remaining pass loans 
short term consumer loans classified as a homogeneous portfolio and the allowance calculated based on past due statistics and past charge off history 
manufactured housing an allowance is prudently calculated based on a review of delinquency statistics 
securitized loans the company considers this a homogeneous portfolio and calculates the allowance based on statistical information provided by the servicer 
charge off history is calculated based on methodologies  a month and a month historical trend and by delinquency information 
the highest requirement of the methods is used 
management reviews the all on a monthly basis and records additional provision to the allowance as required 
the review of the adequacy of the allowance takes into consideration such factors as changes in the growth  size and composition of the loan portfolio  overall portfolio quality  review of specific problem loans  collateral  guarantees and economic conditions that may affect the borrowers ability to pay and and or the value of the underlying collateral 
these estimates depend on the outcome of future events and  therefore  contain inherent uncertainties 
the company s all is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb known and inherent probable losses on existing loans 
a provision for loan losses is charged to expense 
the allowance is charged for losses when management believes that full recovery on the loan is unlikely 
generally  goleta charges off any loan classified as a loss  portions of loans which are deemed to be uncollectible  short term consumer loans which are past due or more days  overdrafts which have been outstanding for more than days  consumer finance loans which are past due or more days  and  all other unsecured loans past due or more days 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance for loan losses 
the following table summarizes the company s loan loss experience for the periods indicated year ended december  in thousands average gross loans  held for investment      gross loans at end of year  held for investment      allowance for loan losses  beginning of year      provision for loan losses      loans charged off commercial real estate     installment short term consumer   securitized     recoveries of loans previously charged off commercial real estate installment short term consumer  securitized net loans charged off     adjustments due to palomar purchase sale allowance for loan losses  end of year      ratios net loan charge offs to average loans net loan charge offs to loans at end of period allowance for loan losses to average loans allowance for loan losses to loans held for investment at end of period net loan charge offs to allowance for loan losses at beginning of period net loan charge offs to provision for loan losses total all decreased million  or  from million at december  to million at december  of this decrease  million  or  relates to decrease in the all for the securitized loan portfolio and  or  relates to all other loan types 
the securitized loan loss allowance changed primarily due to the significant principal balance pay downs of million  or  experienced in both loan pools during  as well as a decrease in net charge offs from as previously discussed  as part of the consent order  no short term consumer loans were originated subsequent to december  therefore  this is part of the all decrease as related loan losses are not anticipated to be substantial 
the decrease in all for the other types of loans is primarily due to the transfer in of million in hltv loans from held for investment to held for sale 
this transfer resulted in a reduction in of the all for hltv loans from  to zero as the company recorded a lower of cost or market adjustment of million on these loans at the transfer date 
at december   million of these loans remain as held for sale with a valuation allowance of  for a net value of  the company held no all for these loans at december  the remaining  reduction in the allowance for other loan types is attributable to increased collections and improved loss delinquency factors in the most recent migration analysis results 
the migration analysis is based on rolling three year historical data weighted more heavily on the four most recent quarters to reflect the most recent experiences in the performance of the portfolio 
loans charged off  net of recoveries  were million in  million in  million in  million in and million in the primary reason for the decline in net charge offs in was the significant paydown in the securitized loan portfolio and the increase in the overall portfolio credit quality specifically in the sba loan portfolio 
at the end of  the company tightened its underwriting standards in the sba program which management believes has influenced the decline in problem loans in the sba portfolio 
despite the increase in short term consumer loan charge offs of  the net charge offs for these loans declined by due to increased loan loss recoveries of over in addition  the securitized loan portfolio experienced a decline in net charge offs of  which was the result of a decline in charge offs and a increase in loan loss recoveries 
the company anticipates this trend to continue as the securitized loans continue to be paid 
in management s opinion  the balance of the allowance for loan losses was sufficient to absorb known and inherent probable losses in the loan portfolio at december  the company recorded million as a provision for loan losses in  million in and million in the primary reason for the decrease in provision expense is the company s change in portfolio mix to perceived less risky loans 
the company exited the hltv market and the securitized loan portfolio paid down by approximately 
the following table summarizes the provision as of december  year ended december  allowance ending percent for loan loan of provision losses  net balance loans short term consumer loan portfolio   securitized loan portfolio    sba    all other loans  total provision    a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest under the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status  collateral value and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments 
loans that experience insignificant payment delays or payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired 
management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case by case basis 
when determining the possibility of impairment  management considers the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower  including the length of the delay  the reasons for the delay  the borrower s prior payment record and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed 
for collateral dependent loans  the company uses the fair value of collateral method to measure impairment 
all other loans  except for securitized and short term consumer are measured for impairment based on the present value of future cash flows 
impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for all loans in the portfolio except for the securitized and short term consumer loans  which are evaluated for impairment on a collective basis 
the recorded investment in loans that are considered to be impaired december  in thousands impaired loans without specific valuation allowances   impaired loans with specific valuation allowances     specific valuation allowances allocated to impaired loans     impaired loans  net      average investment in impaired loans      interest income that would have been recognized at original contract terms    interest income recognized on impaired loans  foregone interest income    the accrual of interest is discontinued when substantial doubt exists as to collectibility of the loan  generally at the time the loan is days delinquent 
any unpaid but accrued interest is reversed at that time 
thereafter  interest income is no longer recognized on the loan 
as such  interest income may be recognized on impaired loans to the extent they are not past due by days 
interest on nonaccrual loans is accounted for on the cash basis or cost recovery method  until qualifying for return to accrual 
loans are returned to accrual status when all of the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured 
all of the nonaccrual loans are impaired 
total impaired loans increased by million  or  over despite this increase  specific valuation allowance allocated to these loans decreased by  or 
of the million in classified assets at december   million were foreclosed and transferred to other real estate owned 
additionally  the company downgraded one large loan of million to nonaccrual during but because this loan is well collateralized  the related specific allowance for loan loss is less than the average 
financial difficulties encountered by certain borrowers may cause the company to restructure the terms of their loan to facilitate loan repayment 
a troubled loan that is restructured would generally be considered impaired 
the balance of impaired loans disclosed above includes all troubled debt restructured loans that  as of december   and  are considered impaired 
total trouble debt restructured loans decreased by  or  from million to  at december  and  respectively 
the following schedule reflects recorded investment at the dates indicated in certain types of loans december  in thousands nonaccrual loans    sba guaranteed portion of loans included above    nonaccrual loans  net      troubled debt restructured loans  gross   loans through days past due with interest accruing     gross up information unavailable for and comparisons even though the net nonaccrual loans increased from december  to december   the total year end allowance for loan losses decreased 
the decrease in the allowance is primarily due to the decrease in the loan portfolio  the migration analysis improvement and that several loans transferred in to nonaccrual status had smaller relative specific allowance allocations 
investment portfolio the following table summarizes the year end carrying values of the company s investment securities for the years indicated year ended december  in thousands us treasury and agency   at december   a federal home loan bank security for  was pledged as collateral to the us treasury for the bank s treasury  tax and loan account 
the following table summarizes the maturity period and weighted average yields of the company s investment securities at december  one year or one to five five to ten over ten less years years years amount yield amount yield amount yield amount yield dollars in thousands us treasury and agency    interest only strips and servicing assets at december  and  the company held interest only strips in the amount of million and million  respectively 
these interest only strips represent the present value of the right to the estimated net cash flows generated by sba loans sold 
net cash flows consist of the difference between a interest at the stated rate paid by borrowers and b the sum of i pass through interest paid to third party investors and ii contractual servicing fees 
the company also held servicing assets related to sba loans sales of million and million at december  and  respectively 
for loans sold subsequent to march   the initial servicing assets and resulting gain on sale were calculated based on the difference between the best actual par and premium bids on an individual loan basis 
the servicing asset balances are subsequently amortized over the estimated life of the loans using an estimated prepayment rate of 
during the second quarter of  the company recorded a million impairment charge related to the valuation of the servicing assets and i o strips 
the interest only strips are accounted for as investments in debt securities classified as trading securities 
accordingly  the company marks them to fair value with the resulting increase or decrease recorded through operations in the current period 
at december  and prior to april   the company utilized a cpr assumption of which is the weighted average actual prepayment speed experienced by all serviced loans which have been in the portfolio for more than eight quarters 
this prepayment speed assumption is applied to all loans including those which have been in the portfolio for less than eight quarters 
the company used discount rates of to in its calculations 
liquidity management the company has established policies as well as analytical tools to manage liquidity 
proper liquidity management ensures that sufficient funds are available to meet normal operating demands in addition to unexpected customer demand for funds  such as high levels of deposit withdrawals or increased loan demand  in a timely and cost effective manner 
the most important factor in the preservation of liquidity is maintaining public confidence that facilitates the retention and growth of core deposits 
ultimately  public confidence is gained through profitable operations  sound credit quality and a strong capital position 
the company s liquidity management is viewed from both a long term and short term perspective as well as from an asset and liability perspective 
management monitors liquidity through regular reviews of maturity profiles  funding sources and loan and deposit forecasts to minimize funding risk 
the company has asset liability committees alco at the board and bank management level to review asset liability management and liquidity issues 
the company maintains strategic liquidity and contingency plans 
previously  the company relied heavily on short term time certificates from other financial institutions obtained quickly to meet liquidity shortfalls 
recently  the company has invested more resources in the purchase of government guaranteed investment securities and obtained a financing arrangement  which allows it to pledge these securities  as collateral for short term borrowing in case of increased liquidity needs 
this arrangement repurchase agreements gives the company improved flexibility in managing its liquidity resources 
the company  through the bank  also has the ability as a member of the federal reserve system  to borrow at the discount window up to of what is pledged at the federal reserve bank 
on january   the reserve bank replaced the existing discount window program with new primary and secondary credit programs 
gnb was notified it qualifies for primary credit as it has been deemed to be in sound financial condition 
the rate on primary credit will be basis points less than the secondary credit rate and will generally be granted on a no questions asked basis at a rate that initially will be at basis points above the federal open market committee s fomc target federal funds rate currently at 
as the rate is currently not attractive  it is unlikely it will be used as a regular source of funding  but is noted as available as an alternative funding source 
the exit from stcl has resulted in a decrease in the daily fluctuations of the company s cash position 
the company has not experienced disintermediation and does not believe this is a potentially probable occurrence 
the bank s core deposits excluding certificate of deposit grew by approximately million during the liquidity ratio of the company has steadily increased and was  and at december  and and  respectively 
the liquidity ratio consists of cash and due from banks  deposits in other financial institutions  available for sale investments  federal funds sold and loans held for sale  divided by total assets 
cwbc s routine funding requirements primarily consist of operating expenses 
normally  cwbc obtains funding to meet its obligations from dividends collected from its subsidiaries and issuance of debt securities 
federal banking laws regulate the amount of dividends that may be paid by banking subsidiaries without prior approval 
in addition  because of goleta s consent order with the occ  it must obtain approval for any amount of dividends 
interest rate risk the company is exposed to different types of interest rate risks 
these risks include lag  repricing  basis and prepayment risk 
lag risk lag risk results from the inherent timing difference between the repricing of the company s adjustable rate assets and liabilities 
for instance  certain loans tied to the prime rate index may only reprice on a quarterly basis 
however  at a community bank such as goleta  when rates are rising  funding sources tend to reprice more slowly than the loans 
therefore  for goleta  the effect of this timing difference is generally favorable during a period of rising interest rates and unfavorable during a period of declining interest rates 
this lag can produce some short term volatility  particularly in times of numerous prime rate changes 
repricing risk repricing risk is caused by the mismatch in the maturities repricing periods between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
if the bank were perfectly matched  the net interest margin would expand during rising rate periods and contract during falling rate periods 
this is so since loans tend to reprice more quickly than funding sources 
typically  since goleta is asset sensitive  this would also tend to expand the net interest margin during times of interest rate increases 
basis risk item pricing tied to different indices may tend to react differently  however  all the bank s variable products are priced off of the prime rate 
prepayment risk prepayment risk results from borrowers paying down off their loans prior to maturity 
prepayments on fixed rate products increase in falling interest rate environments and decrease in rising interest rate environments 
since most of the bank s loan originations are adjustable rate and set based on prime  and there is little lag time on the reset  the bank does not experience significant prepayments 
however  the bank does have more prepayment risk on its securitized loans and its mortgage backed investment securities 
offsetting the prepayment risk on the securitized loans are the related bonds payable  which were issued at a fixed rate 
when the bonds payable prepay  given the current interest rate environment this reduces the bank s interest rate exposure as a higher  fixed rate is  in effect  traded for a lower  variable rate funding source 
management of interest rate risk to mitigate the impact of changes in market interest rates on the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the amounts and maturities are actively managed 
short term  adjustable rate assets are generally retained as they have similar repricing characteristics as our funding sources 
the company sells mortgage products and a portion of its sba loan originations 
while the company has some interest rate exposure in excess of five years  it has internal policy limits designed to minimize risk should interest rates rise 
currently  the company does not use derivative instruments to help manage risk  but will consider such instruments in the future if the perceived need should arise 
loan sales the company s ability to originate  purchase and sell loans is also significantly impacted by changes in interest rates 
increases in interest rates may also reduce the amount of loan and commitment fees received by the company 
a significant decline in interest rates could also decrease the size of the company s servicing portfolio and the related servicing income by increasing the level of prepayments 
the company does not currently utilize any specific hedging instruments to minimize exposure to fluctuations in the market price of loans and interest rates with regard to loans held for sale in the secondary mortgage market 
therefore  in the short time between when the company originates and sells the loans  the company is exposed to decreases in the market price of such loans due to increases in interest rates 
operational risk operational risk represents the risk of loss resulting from the company s operations  including but not limited to  the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside the company  the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees  transaction processing errors and breaches of internal control system and compliance requirements 
this risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of an operational deficiency or as a result of noncompliance with applicable regulatory standards  adverse business decisions or their implementation and customer attrition due to potential negative publicity 
operational risk is inherent in all business activities and the management of this risk is important to the achievement of the company s objectives 
in the event of a breakdown in the internal control system  improper operation of systems or improper employee actions  the company could suffer financial loss  face regulatory action and suffer damage to its reputation 
the company manages operational risk through a risk management framework and its internal control processes 
the framework involves business units  corporate risk management personnel and executive management 
under this framework  the business units have direct and primary responsibility and accountability for identifying  controlling and monitoring operational risk 
business unit managers maintain a system of controls with the objective of providing proper transaction authorization and execution  proper system operations  safeguarding of assets from misuse or theft and ensuring the reliability of financial and other data 
business unit managers ensure that the controls are appropriate and are implemented as designed 
business continuation and disaster recovery planning is also critical to effectively manage operational risks 
the company s internal audit function currently outsourced to a third party validates the system of internal controls through risk based regular and ongoing audit procedures and reports on the effectiveness of internal controls to executive management and the audit committee of the board of directors 
while the company believes that it has designed effective methods to minimize operational risks  there is no absolute assurance that business disruption or operational losses would not occur in the event of disaster 
deposits the following table shows the company s daily average deposits for each of the periods indicated below year ended december  average percent average percent average percent balance of total balance of total balance of total dollars in thousands noninterest bearing demand    interest bearing demand    savings    tcds of  or more    other tcds    total deposits    the maturities of time certificates of deposit tcds were as follows december  tcd s over tcd s over  other tcds  other tcds in thousands less than three months     over three months through six months     over six months through twelve months     over twelve months through five years     total     the deposits of the company may fluctuate up and down with local and national economic conditions 
however  management does not believe that deposit levels are significantly influenced by seasonal factors 
the company manages its money desk in accordance with its liquidity and strategic planning 
such deposits decreased during as the company s general funding needs declined due to loan sales and the exit from certain lending lines 
the company can obtain funds when necessary  in a short timeframe  however  it is more expensive as there is substantial competition for these deposits 
supervision and regulation of the company the following discussion of statutes and regulations affecting banks and their holding companies is only a summary  does not purport to be complete  and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the actual statutes and regulations 
no assurance can be given that the statutes and regulations will not change in the future 
moreover  any changes may have a material adverse effect on our business 
general the company  as a bank holding company registered under the bank holding company act of  as amended herein referred to the bhca  is subject to regulation by the board of governors of the federal reserve system frb 
under frb regulation  the company is expected to act as a source of managerial and financial strength for its bank subsidiary 
it cannot conduct operations in an unsafe or unsound manner and must commit resources to support its banking subsidiary in circumstances where the company might not otherwise do so 
under the bhca  the company and its banking subsidiary are subject to periodic examination by the frb 
the company is also required to file periodic reports of its operations and any additional information regarding its activities and those of its subsidiaries with the frb  as may be required 
the company is also a bank holding company within the meaning of section of the california financial code 
as such  the company and its subsidiaries are subject to examination by  and may be required to file reports with  the commissioner of the california department of financial institutions  herein referred to as the commissioner or the dfi 
regulations have not yet been proposed or adopted or steps otherwise taken to implement the commissioner s powers under this statute 
the company has a class of securities registered with the securities exchange commission sec under section of the securities exchange act of act and has its common stock listed on the national market system of the nasdaq market system nasdaq 
consequently  the company is subject to supervision and regulation of the sec and compliance with the listing requirements of the nasdaq 
recent legislation the sarbanes oxley act of the sarbanes oxley act of sox became effective on july  and represents the most far reaching corporate and accounting reform legislation since the enactment of the securities act of and the securities exchange act of act 
sox is designed to protect investors in capital markets by improving the accuracy and reliability of corporate disclosures of public companies 
it is designed to address weaknesses in the audit process  financial reporting systems and controls and broker dealer networks surrounding companies that have a class of securities registered under section of the act or are otherwise reporting to the sec pursuant to section d of the act collectively  public companies 
it is intended that by addressing three weaknesses public companies will be able to avoid the problems encountered by many notable public companies in the provisions of sox and regulations issued by the sec and the national association of securities dealers for companies whose shares are listed on nasdaq on which the company s shares are listed will have a direct and significant impact on banks and bank holding companies that are public companies  including the company 
enhanced financial disclosure and reports certification of financial statements 
two sections of sox sections and require that the principal executive officer s and the principal financial officer s of an issuer certify that the company s periodic reports ie quarterly and annual reports do not contain any untrue statements of material fact  contain financial statements that fully comply with the applicable sections of the act and fairly present the financial conditions and results of operations of the company 
under section  the certifying officers are responsible for designing controls to ensure that all material information is reported to them  evaluating the effectiveness of the controls at least once every days and reporting their conclusions and recommended corrective action to the company s auditors and audit committee 
the section certification imposes significant criminal penalties for knowing or willful false representations in the public company s financial statements including fines of up to million and prison sentences of up to years 
of course  such conduct also exposes the officer to civil liability including shareholder suits for violations of section b of the act 
these certification provisions became effective august  disclosure of material information 
under rules adopted by the sec  reporting companies with a public float of at least million  that have been reporting for at least months  have previously filed at least one annual report  and are not small business issuers will have to accelerate the filing of their periodic reports over three years beginning with the fiscal year ending on or after december  the due date for annual reports will be reduced from days to days after the fiscal year end in the second year and then to days after the fiscal year end in the third year and beyond 
the quarterly reports will be due days after quarter end in the second year and then be further reduced to days for the third year and thereafter 
in addition  accelerated filers will have to make their periodic reports available on their websites for fiscal years ended on or after december  section of sox requires that public companies report on a rapid and current basis information regarding material changes to its financial condition and other operations 
in response thereto  effective march   the sec has adopted rules to improve the timeliness of public disclosure of such information 
under those rules a current report on form k must be filed with the sec within five business days of any public announcement of material non public information regarding a public company s result of operations or financial conditions for a prior annual or quarterly fiscal period 
while this regulation does not require the filing of the report upon the occurrence of the event that effects the company s financial condition  once an announcement has been made regarding the previously non public information  the report on form k is required 
all further announcements made within hours of the form k filing regarding the same information do not trigger an additional form k filing 
section of sox requires public companies to disclose in their quarterly and annual reports all material off balance sheet transactions  arrangement  obligations  and other relationships that may have a material current or future effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  or capital expenditures or resources 
under implementing regulations adopted by the sec  these disclosures are to be made part of a separately captioned section of the company s management discussion and analysis and in a tabular format 
the nature and business purpose of the off balance sheet arrangement  the financial impact and risk exposure and the actual amounts of payment due for each category and time period therefore must be disclosed 
compliance with most amendments is required for all financial statements for fiscal years ending on or after december  sox also requires directors  officers and beneficial owners of more than ten percent of the public company s securities ie section reporting persons to file a notice of their attaining such status within days following the occurrence and to file reports of their purchase or sale of the company s securities not later than the second business day following the day of the transaction s 
section of sox prohibits directors and officers from being involved  directly or indirectly  in a purchase or sale of the company s equity securities during any mandatory blackout period for the company s employee pension plans during which the plan participants and beneficiaries are prevented from engaging in transactions regarding the public company s securities held in their pension plan accounts 
under this section  the company or its shareholders in a derivative suit may seek to recover any profit realized in violation of this section in an action against the director or officer 
section of sox requires the sec to review the financial statements and other disclosures issued by public companies on a regular and systematic basis which  in any event  shall not be less frequently than once every three years 
in scheduling the reviews  the sec will take into account issuers i that have issued material restatements of its financial statements  ii that have experienced significant volatility in their stock price  iii whose operations effect material sectors of the economy  iv with the largest market capitalization  and v emerging companies 
enhanced accounting oversight  board independence and conflicts of interest public accounting oversight board 
sox establishes the public company accounting oversight board board 
the board is a non profit corporation to be composed of five persons of integrity and reputation who have demonstrated a commitment to the investing public and are understanding of the responsibilities of financial disclosure under the securities law 
the board will be appointed by and operate under the supervision of the sec 
section of sox authorizes the board to set standards for the accounting industry including auditing standards  quality control standards  and independence standards 
all accounting firms that audit public companies must register with the board within days of the board s establishment under sox  the board is to be established by the sec by april  the board will have the power to inspect the firms  conduct investigations and disciplinary proceedings and oversee compliance by the public accounting firms with the standards established to restore investor confidence in the periodic reports of public companies 
auditor independence 
in addition to accounting firms being subject to oversight by the board  sox prohibits registered public accounting firms from providing audit and certain non audit services to the same public company 
sox also prohibits any accounting firm from providing audit services if an executive officer of the public company was employed by that firm during the one year preceding initiation of the audit 
the law also makes it unlawful for public accounting firms to audit a public company if the lead partner in the audit has performed audit services in each of the previous five years 
this is to force accounting firms to rotate their lead partner on audits 
independent audit committees 
one of the most critical provisions of sox is section which requires the sec to direct national securities exchanges to delist all public companies that do not establish audit committees made up of entirely independent members of the board of directors 
if a separate audit committee is not established  the board of directors will be deemed to be the audit committee and will have to satisfy the independence standard 
to be independent the member must not receive any consulting  advisory or other fees or compensation from the public company other than director fees or be an affiliated person of the company 
the definition of affiliated person for this purpose has not yet been established by the sec 
as section amends section a of the act  and since section a of the act refers to the definition provided in the investment company act several commentators have suggested that the definition of an affiliated person in that statute should apply 
an affiliate person therein is and owner or holder with the power to vote of five percent or more of outstanding voting securities of the company or any officer  director  or employee of the company 
this definition would require that all directors be precluded from serving on the audit committee 
obviously  further clarification from the sec is needed 
the audit committee is responsible for the appointment  compensation and oversight of the company s auditors 
section requires that the audit committee pre approve all audit and non audit services to be performed by the outside accountants 
the auditors must report directly to the audit committee 
the committee has authority to engage its own legal counsel and advisors to assist them in carrying out their duties 
the public company is obligated to provide adequate funding for the committee to meet its obligations 
section of sox requires public companies to disclose in their periodic reports whether the audit committee of the company includes at least one member whose education and experience as a public accountant  auditor or principal financial or accounting officer renders them capable of understanding generally accepted accounting principles  gives them experience in the preparation of financial statements and the application of principles as well as experience in internal accounting controls and audit committee functions 
while this provision does not require the inclusion of such an audit committee financial expert on the committee  the likely market reaction to the disclosure that the company has failed to appoint such a person is likely to result in public companies working diligently to include at least one audit committee financial expert on its audit committee 
public companies must comply with the disclosure requirements of section in their annual reports for fiscal years ending on or after july  small business issuers have to comply in their annual reports for fiscal years ending on or after december  section of sox makes it unlawful for any officer or director of a public company to influence  coerce  manipulate or mislead any auditor of the company s financial statements 
the sec is empowered to enforce this provision in civil proceedings 
code of ethics 
section of sox requires the disclosure as to whether a public company has adopted a code of ethics establishing standards that promote i honest and ethical conduct by the board of directors  ii the company s full  fair and accurate disclosures in the company s periodic reports and iii the company s compliance with applicable rules and regulations 
should a company fail to adopt such a code of ethics its disclosure must also explain why the company has filed to do so 
regulations promulgated by the sec require disclosure of such information in annual reports for fiscal years ending on or after july  independent board of directors 
in response to sox  the national securities exchanges have issued proposed rules to the sec that increase the independence of the boards of directors 
under proposed rules nasdaq listed companies that are not controlled by an individual or a group that owns or controls more than of the company s stock are required to have a board of directors a majority of whose members are independent 
to be independent  the proposed rules state that the directors must have no relationship which  in the company s board of directors opinion  would interfere with the exercise of independent judgments as a director 
a director is not independent if that person i has received more than  from the company for services other than board or committees service  ii is or was an employee of the company s auditing firm that worked on the company audit  iii is a partner or controlling shareholder or executive officer of any entity that receives from or makes payments to the company in an amount that exceeds of the entity s gross revenues or  which ever is greater in the current year or in any of the past three years or iv is a part of an interlocking compensation committee 
the independent directors must meet regularly in executive session 
adoption of the final rules by nasdaq is awaiting sec approval 
independent nominating committee and compensation committee 
proposed nasdaq rules would also require that any director nominating committee established be comprised of independent directors  a majority of whom approve all director nominations 
the committee may include one non independent director who is an officer and owns more than of the outstanding voting securities of the company or any other non independent director under specified exceptional circumstances 
if such a committee is not established  a majority of the independent directors must act upon nominations 
nasdaq proposed rules also require that any compensation committee established be comprised of independent directors with the exception that one non independent director may serve for two years under specified exceptional circumstances 
this committee must approve all executive officer compensation 
if no such committee is established  a majority of the independent directors must approve all executive officer compensation 
director and executive officer loans 
section of sox prohibits public companies and their subsidiaries from making loans to a director or executive officer from and after july  this prohibition  however  does not apply to insured depositary institutions provided the loan is subject to section h of the federal reserve act and regulation o 
consequently  banks and bank subsidiaries may continue to make loans to their directors and executive officers as long as they comply with regulation o 
however  the ban on insider loans imposed by section still applies to the bank holding company or any nonbank subsidiary as it is not an insured depositary institution 
section still permits certain loans including  home improvement loans  consumer credit and charge cards  provided the extension of credit is made in the ordinary cause of business  is the type of credit generally made to the public by the company and is made on no more favorable terms than offered to the general public 
stock option plans 
while sox does not address procedures for modification of stock option plans  nasdaq proposed rules would require shareholder approval of newly adopted stock option plans and significant modification of existing plans 
there are certain exceptions including the assumption of outstanding options as part of a merger and employee stock ownership plans 
attorney conduct 
section of sox grants the sec the authority to establish federal standards for attorneys regarding their obligations to report evidence of a material violation of securities law or a breach of fiduciary duty to the public company s chief executive officer or chief legal counsel 
the statute indicates that should those persons not appropriately respond the attorney must report the information to the audit committee or other duly designated independent committee of the board of directors 
enhanced enforcement powers and penalties document destruction 
sections and of sox create new crimes for document tampering or destruction 
anyone who knowing alters  destroys  mutilates  conceals  covers up  falsifies or makes a false entry in any document with the intent of influencing an investigation or administrative proceeding can be imprisoned for up to years and fined for their conduct 
in addition  section provides that whoever corruptly alters  destroys  mutilates or conceals a record  document or other object with the intent to impair the objects integrity or availability for use in an official proceeding or attempts to influence or impede any official proceeding can be fined and imprisoned for up to years 
forfeiture for restated financial statements 
section of sox provides that should a company be required to restate its financial statements due to a material non compliance with the reporting requirements as a result of misconduct of the principal executive officer s or the principal financial officer s  the officer must reimburse the company the amount of any bonus or equity based compensation received during the twelve months preceding the improper reporting and any profits realized by the officer from the company s securities during the same period 
no discharge in bankruptcy 
section prohibits an officer of a public company who has been adjudicated guilty of securities fraud from discharging the judgment in bankruptcy thereby causing the officer to remain personally liable until the judgment is satisfied 
power to freeze funds 
under sox  the sec enforcement powers have also been enhanced allowing the sec to obtain a temporary or permanent ban against an individual prohibiting that person from continuing to serve as an officer of a public company upon a showing in an administrative proceeding that the individual is unfit to serve as an officer 
section of sox also authorizes the sec to freeze extraordinary payments to officers or directors for up to days during an sec investigation 
the freeze on the funds may remain in effect beyond the day period should the sec commence an action against the officer for securities law violations 
whistleblower protection 
section of sox affirmatively prohibits a public company from discharging or discriminating against ie demoting  suspending  threatening or harassing any officer  employee  contractor or agent because the person has provided information or otherwise assisted in an investigation conducted by federal regulatory or law enforcement agency  congress or a person in the public company with supervisory authority over the employee  contractor or agent 
the whistleblower may file an action with the department of labor or in federal court if no action is taken within days of the filing 
securities fraud felony 
section of sox creates a new federal crime punishable by a fine and imprisonment for up to years for anyone who knowingly executes  or attempts to execute  a scheme or artifice to defraud any person in connection with any security of a public company 
extended statue of limitation 
section of sox has extended the time frame in which claims may be filed under section b of the act 
claimants now have until the earlier of two years after discovery of the fraud or five years after the violation to initiate a lawsuit 
although no assurances can be given  it is anticipated that this far reaching legislation and the rules to be issued by the sec and the national securities exchanges pursuant to sox will result in significant additional regulations and requirements for compliance by banks and their bank holding companies 
it is likely that these additional obligations will result in additional significant and material expenditures by the public companies in auditors fees  directors fees  attorneys fees  outside advisor fees  increased errors and omissions insurance premium costs  increased errors and omissions insurance premium costs and other costs of compliance for the public companies to satisfy the new requirements for corporate governance imposed by sox and the accompanying rules and regulations 
the california corporate disclosure act on january   the california corporate disclosure act ccd became effective 
the new law requires that all publicly traded companies file with the california secretary of state a statement on an annual basis that includes at least the following information the name of the independent auditor for the publicly traded company  a description of the services rendered by the auditor during the previous months  the date of the last audit and a copy of the report the annual compensation paid to each director and executive officer including options or shares granted to them that were not available to other employees of the company a description of any loans made to any director at a preferential loan rate during the previous months including the amount and terms a statement indicating whether any bankruptcy has been filed by the company s executive officers or directors during the past years the statement indicating whether any member of the board of directors or executive officer was convicted of fraud during the past years a statement indicating whether the corporation has bee adjudicated as guilty of having violated any federal securities laws or any banking or securities laws of california during the past years which a judgment of over  was imposed for purposes of the ccd  a publicly traded company is any company whose securities are listed on a national or foreign exchange or which is the subject of a two way quotation system that is regularly published 
bank holding company liquidity the company is a legal entity  separate and distinct from its bank subsidiary 
although it has the ability to raise capital on its own behalf or borrow from external sources  the company may also obtain additional funds through dividends paid by  and fees for services provided to  the bank 
however  regulatory constraints may restrict or totally preclude the bank from paying dividends to the company 
see limitations on dividend payments 
the frb s policy regarding dividends provides that a bank holding company should not pay cash dividends exceeding its net income or which can only be funded in ways  such as by borrowing  that weaken the bank holding company s financial health or its ability to act as a source of financial strength to its subsidiary banks 
the frb also possesses enforcement powers over bank holding companies and their non bank subsidiaries to prevent or remedy actions that represent unsafe or unsound practices or violations of applicable statutes and regulations 
in march  the company entered into a mou with the frb  which requires the company to refrain from declaring any dividends on the company s stock or redeeming any of its stock without the approval of the frb 
see memorandum of understanding with the federal reserve bank 
transactions with affiliates the company and any subsidiaries it may purchase or organize are deemed to be affiliates of the bank subsidiary within the meaning of sections a and b of the federal reserve act  herein referred to as the fra  as amended 
pursuant thereto  loans by goleta to affiliates  investments by goleta in affiliates stock  and taking affiliates stock as collateral for loans to any borrower will be limited to of goleta s capital  in the case of any one affiliate  and will be limited to of goleta s capital in the case of all affiliates 
in addition  such transactions must be on terms and conditions that are consistent with safe and sound banking practices 
specifically  a bank and its subsidiaries generally may not purchase from an affiliate a low quality asset  as defined in the fra 
such restrictions also prevent a bank holding company and its other affiliates from borrowing from a banking subsidiary of the bank holding company unless the loans are secured by marketable collateral of designated amounts 
the company and goleta are also subject to certain restrictions with respect to engaging in the underwriting  public sale and distribution of securities 
see supervision and regulation of the bank subsidiary significant legislation 
limitations on businesses and investment activities under the bhca  a bank holding company must obtain the frb s approval before directly or indirectly acquiring more than ownership or control of any voting shares of another bank or bank holding company acquiring all or substantially all of the assets of another bank merging or consolidating with another bank holding company the frb may allow a bank holding company to acquire banks located in any state of the united states without regard to whether the acquisition is prohibited by the law of the state in which the target bank is located 
in approving interstate acquisitions  however  the frb must give effect to applicable state laws limiting the aggregate amount of deposits that may be held by the acquiring bank holding company and its insured depository institutions in the state in which the target bank is located  provided that those limits do not discriminate against out of state depository institutions or their holding companies  and state laws which require that the target bank have been in existence for a minimum period of time  not to exceed five years  before being acquired by an out of state bank holding company 
in general  the bhca prohibits a bank holding company from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than of the voting securities of a company that is not a bank or a bank holding company 
however  with frb consent  a bank holding company may own subsidiaries engaged in certain businesses that the frb has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto 
the company  therefore  is permitted to engage in a variety of banking related businesses  subject to limitations imposed as a result of regulatory action 
see memorandum of understanding with the federal reserve bank 
some of the activities that the frb has determined  pursuant to its regulation y  to be related to banking are making or acquiring loans or other extensions of credit for its own account or for the account of others servicing loans and other extensions of credit operating a trust company in the manner authorized by federal or state law under certain circumstances leasing personal and real property or acting as agent  broker  or adviser in leasing such property in accordance with various restrictions imposed by frb regulations acting as investment or financial advisor providing management consulting advice under certain circumstances providing support services  including courier services and printing and selling micr encoded items acting as a principal  agent or broker for insurance under certain circumstances making equity and debt investments in corporations or projects designed primarily to promote community welfare or jobs for residents providing financial  banking or economic data processing and data transmission services owning  controlling or operating a savings association under certain circumstances selling money orders  travelers checks and us savings bonds providing securities brokerage services  related securities credit activities pursuant to regulation t and other incidental activities underwriting and dealing in obligations of the united states  general obligations of states and their political subdivisions and other obligations authorized for state member banks under federal law generally  the bhca does not place territorial restrictions on the domestic activities of non bank subsidiaries of bank holding companies 
federal law prohibits a bank holding company and any subsidiary banks from engaging in certain tie in arrangements in connection with the extension of credit 
thus  for example  goleta may not extend credit  lease or sell property  or furnish any services  or fix or vary the consideration for any of the foregoing on the condition that the customer must obtain or provide some additional credit  property or services from or to goleta other than a loan  discount  deposit or trust service the customer must obtain or provide some additional credit  property or service from or to the company or goleta the customer may not obtain some other credit  property or services from competitors  except reasonable requirements to assure soundness of credit extended in  the gramm leach bliley act glb act was enacted 
the glb act significantly changed the regulatory structure and oversight of the financial services industry 
the glb act permits banks and bank holding companies to engage in previously prohibited activities under certain conditions 
also  banks and bank holding companies may affiliate with other financial service providers such as insurance companies and securities firms under certain conditions 
consequently  a qualifying bank holding company  called a financial holding company fhc  can engage in a full range of financial activities  including banking  insurance and securities activities  as well as merchant banking and additional activities that are beyond those traditionally permitted for bank holding companies 
moreover  various non bank financial service providers who were previously prohibited from engaging in banking can now acquire banks while also offering services such as securities underwriting and underwriting and brokering insurance products 
the glb act also expands passive investment activities by fhcs  permitting them to indirectly invest in any type of company  financial or non financial  through merchant banking activities and insurance company affiliations 
see supervision and regulation of the bank subsidiary significant legislation 
capital adequacy bank holding companies must maintain minimum levels of capital under the frb s risk based capital adequacy guidelines 
if capital falls below minimum guideline levels  a bank holding company  among other things  may be denied approval to acquire or establish additional banks or non bank businesses 
the frb s risk based capital adequacy guidelines for bank holding companies and state member banks  discussed in more detail below see supervision and regulation of the bank subsidiary risk based capital guidelines  assign various risk percentages to different categories of assets and capital is measured as a percentage of those risk assets 
under the terms of the guidelines  bank holding companies are expected to meet capital adequacy guidelines based both on total risk assets and on total assets  without regard to risk weights 
the risk based guidelines are minimum requirements 
higher capital levels will be required if warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profiles of individual organizations 
for example  the frb s capital guidelines contemplate that additional capital may be required to take adequate account of  among other things  interest rate risk  the risks posed by concentrations of credit or risks associated with nontraditional banking activities or securities trading activities 
moreover  any banking organization experiencing or anticipating significant growth or expansion into new activities  particularly under the expanded powers of the glb act  may be expected to maintain capital ratios  including tangible capital positions  well above the minimum levels 
limitations on dividend payments the company is entitled to receive dividends when and as declared by goleta s board of directors  out of funds legally available for dividends  as specified and limited by the occ s regulations 
pursuant to the occ s regulations  funds available for a national bank s dividends are restricted to the lesser of the bank s i retained earnings  or ii net income for the current and past two fiscal years less any dividends paid during that period  unless approved by the occ 
furthermore  if the occ determines that a dividend would cause a bank s capital to be impaired or that payment would cause it to be undercapitalized  the occ can prohibit payment of a dividend notwithstanding that funds are legally available 
moreover  goleta is subject to a consent order with the occ that prohibits the payment of dividends unless goleta is in compliance with the capital plan and the applicable provisions of the national bank act and has received the approval of the occ 
see supervision and regulation of the bank subsidiary consent order with the occ 
since goleta is an fdic insured institution  it is also possible  depending upon its financial condition and other factors  that the fdic could assert that the payment of dividends or other payments might  under some circumstances  constitute an unsafe or unsound practice and  thus  prohibit those payments 
as a california corporation  the company s ability to pay dividends is subject to the dividend limitations of the california corporations code ccc 
section of the ccc allows the company to pay a dividend to its shareholders only to the extent that the company has retained earnings and  after the dividend  the company meets the following criteria its assets exclusive of goodwill and other intangible assets would be times its liabilities exclusive of deferred taxes  deferred income and other deferred credits  and its current assets would be at least equal to its current liabilities 
the company is currently prohibited form paying dividends without the prior approval of the frb 
see supervision and regulations of the bank subsidiary memorandum of understanding with the federal reserve bank 
supervision and regulation of the bank subsidiary general banking is a complex  highly regulated industry 
the primary goals of the regulatory scheme are to maintain a safe and sound banking system  protect depositors and the fdic s insurance fund and facilitate to conduct of sound monetary policy 
in furtherance of these goals  congress and the states have created several largely autonomous regulatory agencies and enacted numerous laws that govern banks  bank holding companies and financial services industry 
consequently  goleta s growth and earnings performance can be affected not only by management decisions and general economic conditions  but also by the requirements of applicable state and federal statutes  regulations and the policies of various governmental regulatory authorities  including the frb  the occ and the fdic 
the system of supervision and regulation applicable to goleta governs most aspects of goleta s business  including the scope of permissible business investments reserves that must be maintained against deposits capital levels that must be maintained the nature and amount of collateral that may be taken to secure loans the establishment of new branches mergers and consolidations with other financial institutions the payment of dividends goleta  as a national banking association member  is also a member of the federal reserve system  is subject to regulation  supervision and regular examination by the occ  the fdic and the frb 
goleta s deposits are insured by the fdic up to the maximum extent provided by law 
the regulations of these agencies govern most aspects of the goleta s business 
california law exempts all banks from usury limitations on interest rates 
the following summarizes the material elements of the regulatory framework that applies to goleta 
it does not describe all of the statutes  regulations and regulatory policies that are applicable 
also  it does not restate all of the requirements of the statutes  regulations and regulatory policies that are described 
consequently  the following summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the applicable statutes  regulations and regulatory policies may have material effect on goleta s business 
significant legislation in  the glb act was signed into law  significantly changing the regulatory structure and oversight of the financial services industry 
the glb act repealed the provisions of the glass steagall act that restricted banks and securities firms from affiliating 
it also revised the bhca to permit an fhc to engage in a full range of financial activities  including banking  insurance  securities and merchant banking activities 
it also permits fhcs to acquire many types of financial firms without the frb s prior approval 
the glb act thus provides expanded financial affiliation opportunities for existing bank holding companies and permits other financial service providers to acquire banks and become bank holding companies without ceasing any existing financial activities 
previously  a bank holding company could only engage in activities that were closely related to banking 
this limitation no longer applies to bank holding companies that qualify to be treated as fhcs 
to qualify as an fhc  a bank holding company s subsidiary depository institutions must be well capitalized  well managed and have at least a satisfactory community reinvestment act  herein referred to as cra  examination rating 
non qualifying bank holding companies are limited to activities that were permissible under the bhca as of november  the glb act changed the powers of national banks and their subsidiaries and made similar changes in the powers of state chartered banks and their subsidiaries 
national banks may now underwrite  deal in and purchase state and local revenue bonds 
subsidiaries of national banks may now engage in financial activities that the bank cannot itself engage in  except for general insurance underwriting and real estate development and investment 
for a subsidiary of a national bank to engage in these new financial activities  the national bank and its depository institution affiliates must be well capitalized  have at least satisfactory general  managerial and cra examination ratings  and meet other qualification requirements relating to total assets  subordinated debt  capital  risk management and affiliate transactions 
subsidiaries of state chartered banks can exercise the same powers as national bank subsidiaries if they satisfy the same qualifying rules that apply to national banks  except that state chartered banks do not have to satisfy the managerial and debt rating requirements applicable to national banks 
the glb act also reformed the overall regulatory framework of the financial services industry 
to implement its underlying purposes  the glb act preempted conflicting state laws that would restrict the types of financial affiliations that are authorized or permitted under the glb act  subject to specified exceptions for state insurance laws and regulations 
with regard to securities laws  effective may   the glb act removed the current blanket exemption for banks from being considered brokers or dealers under the securities exchange act of and replaced it with a number of more limited exemptions 
thus  previously exempted banks may become subject to the broker dealer registration and supervision requirements of the securities exchange act of the exemption that prevented bank holding companies and banks that advised mutual funds from being considered investment advisers under the investment advisers act of was also eliminated 
separately  the glb act imposes customer privacy requirements on any company engaged in financial activities 
under these requirements  a financial company is required to protect the security and confidentiality of customer nonpublic personal information 
also  for customers that obtain a financial product such as a loan for personal  family or household purposes  a financial company is required to disclose its privacy policy to the customer at the time the relationship is established and annually thereafter  including its policies concerning the sharing of the customer s nonpublic personal information with affiliates and third parties 
if an exemption is not available  a financial company must provide consumers with a notice of its information sharing practices that allows the consumer to reject the disclosure of its nonpublic personal information to third parties 
third parties that receive such information are subject to the same restrictions as the financial company on the reuse of the information 
a financial company is prohibited from disclosing an account number or similar item to a third party for use in telemarketing  direct mail marketing or other marketing through electronic mail 
risk based capital guidelines general 
the federal banking agencies have established minimum capital standards known as risk based capital guidelines 
these guidelines are intended to provide a measure of capital that reflects the degree of risk associated with a bank s operations 
the risk based capital guidelines include both a new definition of capital and a framework for calculating the amount of capital that must be maintained against a bank s assets and off balance sheet items 
the amount of capital required to be maintained is based upon the credit risks associated with the various types of a bank s assets and off balance sheet items 
a bank s assets and off balance sheet items are classified under several risk categories  with each category assigned a particular risk weighting from to 
the bank s risk based capital ratio is calculated by dividing its qualifying capital  which is the numerator of the ratio  by the combined risk weights of its assets and off balance sheet items  which is the denominator of the ratio 
qualifying capital 
a bank s total qualifying capital consists of two types of capital components core capital elements  known as tier capital  and supplementary capital elements  known as tier capital 
the tier component of a bank s qualifying capital must represent at least of total qualifying capital and may consist of the following items that are defined as core capital elements common stockholders equity  qualifying non cumulative perpetual preferred stock including related surplus minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries the tier component of a bank s total qualifying capital may consist of the following items a portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses certain types of perpetual preferred stock and related surplus certain types of hybrid capital instruments and mandatory convertible debt securities a portion of term subordinated debt and intermediate term preferred stock  including related surplus risk weighted assets and off balance sheet items 
assets and credit equivalent amounts of off balance sheet items are assigned to one of several broad risk classifications  according to the obligor or  if relevant  the guarantor or the nature of the collateral 
the aggregate dollar value of the amount in each risk classification is then multiplied by the risk weight associated with that classification 
the resulting weighted values from each of the risk classifications are added together 
this total is the bank s total risk weighted assets 
a two step process determines risk weights for off balance sheet items  such as unfunded loan commitments  letters of credit and recourse arrangements 
first  the credit equivalent amount of the off balance sheet items is determined  in most cases by multiplying the off balance sheet item by a credit conversion factor 
second  the credit equivalent amount is treated like any balance sheet asset and is assigned to the appropriate risk category according to the obligor or  if relevant  the guarantor or the nature of the collateral 
this result is added to the bank s risk weighted assets and comprises the denominator of the risk based capital ratio 
minimum capital standards 
the supervisory standards set forth below specify minimum capital ratios based primarily on broad risk considerations 
the risk based ratios do not take explicit account of the quality of individual asset portfolios or the range of other types of risks to which banks may be exposed  such as interest rate  liquidity  market or operational risks 
for this reason  banks are generally expected to operate with capital positions above the minimum ratios 
all banks are required to meet a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk weighted assets of 
at least must be in the form of tier capital  net of goodwill 
the maximum amount of supplementary capital elements that qualifies as tier capital is limited to of tier capital  net of goodwill 
in addition  the combined maximum amount of term subordinated debt and intermediate term preferred stock that qualifies as tier capital for risk based capital purposes is limited to of tier capital 
the maximum amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses that qualifies as tier capital is limited to of gross risk weighted assets 
the allowance for loan and lease losses in excess of this limit may  of course  be maintained  but would not be included in a bank s risk based capital calculation 
the federal banking agencies also require all banks to maintain a minimum amount of tier capital to total assets  referred to as the leverage ratio 
for a bank rated in the highest of the five categories used by regulators to rate banks  the minimum leverage ratio of tier capital to total assets is 
for all banks not rated in the highest category  the minimum leverage ratio must be at least to 
these uniform risk based capital guidelines and leverage ratios apply across the industry 
regulators  however  have the discretion to set minimum capital requirements for individual institutions  which may be significantly above the minimum guidelines and ratios 
in october  goleta entered into a consent order with the occ that requires goleta to maintain a risk based capital and a tier i capital ratio 
see consent order with the occ 
other factors affecting minimum capital standards the federal banking agencies have established certain benchmark ratios of loan loss reserves to be held against classified assets 
the benchmark by federal banking agencies is the sum of of assets classified loss of assets classified doubtful of assets classified substandard and estimated credit losses on other assets over the upcoming months the federal risk based capital rules adopted by banking agencies take into account bank s concentrations of credit and the risks of engaging in non traditional activities 
concentrations of credit refers to situations where a lender has a relatively large proportion of loans involving a single borrower  industry  geographic location  collateral or loan type 
non traditional activities are considered those that have not customarily been part of the banking business  but are conducted by a bank as a result of developments in  for example  technology  financial markets or other additional activities permitted by law or regulation 
the regulations require institutions with high or inordinate levels of risk to operate with higher minimum capital standards 
the federal banking agencies also are authorized to review an institution s management of concentrations of credit risk for adequacy and consistency with safety and soundness standards regarding internal controls  credit underwriting or other operational and managerial areas 
the federal banking agencies also limit the amount of deferred tax assets that are allowable in computing a bank s regulatory capital 
deferred tax assets that can be realized for taxes paid in prior carryback years and from future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences are generally not limited 
however  deferred tax assets that can only be realized through future taxable earnings are limited for regulatory capital purposes to the lesser of the amount that can be realized within one year of the quarter end report date or of tier capital the amount of any deferred tax in excess of this limit would be excluded from tier capital  total assets and regulatory capital calculations 
the federal banking agencies have also adopted a joint agency policy statement which provides that the adequacy and effectiveness of a bank s interest rate risk management process and the level of its interest rate exposure is a critical factor in the evaluation of the bank s capital adequacy 
a bank with material weaknesses in its interest rate risk management process or high levels of interest rate exposure relative to its capital will be directed by the federal banking agencies to take corrective actions 
financial institutions which have significant amounts of their assets concentrated in high risk loans or nontraditional banking activities  and who fail to adequately manage these risks  may be required to set aside capital in excess of the regulatory minimums 
prompt corrective action the federal banking agencies possess broad powers to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of insured banks 
each federal banking agency has issued regulations defining five capital categories well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized 
under the regulations  a bank shall be deemed to be well capitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of or more  has a tier risk based capital ratio of or more  has a leverage capital ratio of or more and is not subject to specified requirements to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure adequately capitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of or more  a tier risk based capital ratio of or more and a leverage capital ratio of or more under certain circumstances and does not meet the definition of well capitalized undercapitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio that is less than  a tier risk based capital ratio that is less than  or a leverage capital ratio that is less than under certain circumstances significantly undercapitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio that is less than  a tier risk based capital ratio that is less than or a leverage capital ratio that is less than  and critically undercapitalized if it has a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is equal to or less than banks are prohibited from paying dividends or management fees to controlling persons or entities if  after making the payment  the bank would be undercapitalized  that is  the bank fails to meet the required minimum level for any relevant capital measure 
asset growth and branching restrictions apply to undercapitalized banks 
banks classified as undercapitalized are required to submit acceptable capital plans guaranteed by its holding company  if any 
broad regulatory authority was granted with respect to significantly undercapitalized banks  including forced mergers  growth restrictions  ordering new elections for directors  forcing divestiture by its holding company  if any  requiring management changes and prohibiting the payment of bonuses to senior management 
even more severe restrictions are applicable to critically undercapitalized banks  those with capital at or less than 
restrictions for these banks include the appointment of a receiver or conservator after days  even if the bank is still solvent 
all of the federal banking agencies have promulgated substantially similar regulations to implement this system of prompt corrective action 
a bank  based upon its capital levels  that is classified as well capitalized  adequately capitalized or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency  after notice and opportunity for hearing  determines that an unsafe or unsound condition  or an unsafe or unsound practice  warrants such treatment 
at each successive lower capital category  an insured bank is subject to more restrictions 
the federal banking agencies  however  may not treat an institution as critically undercapitalized unless its capital ratios actually warrant such treatment 
deposit insurance assessments the fdic has implemented a risk based assessment system in which the deposit insurance premium relates to the probability that the deposit insurance fund will incur a loss 
the fdic sets semi annual assessments in an amount necessary to maintain or increase the reserve ratio of the insurance fund to at least of insured deposits or a higher percentage as determined to be justified by the fdic 
under the risk based assessment system adopted by the fdic  banks are categorized into one of three capital categories  well capitalized  adequately capitalized  and undercapitalized 
assignment of a bank into a particular capital category is based on supervisory evaluations by its primary federal regulator 
after being assigned to a particular capital category  a bank is classified into one of three supervisory categories 
the three supervisory categories are group a financially sound with only a few minor weaknesses group b demonstrates weaknesses that could result in significant deterioration group c poses a substantial probability of loss 
the capital ratios used by the fdic to define well capitalized  adequately capitalized and undercapitalized are the same as in the prompt corrective action regulations 
the assessment rates are summarized below  expressed in terms of cents per in insured deposits assessment rates supervisory group capital group group a group b group c well capitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized the bank is currently risk rated a b  which translates to well capitalized  group b and is assessed a rate of basis points 
interstate banking and branching bank holding companies from any state may generally acquire banks and bank holding companies located in any other state  subject in some cases to nationwide and state imposed deposit concentration limits and limits on the acquisition of recently established banks 
banks also have the ability  subject to specific restrictions  to acquire by acquisition or merger branches located outside their home state 
the establishment of new interstate branches is also possible in those states with laws that expressly permit it 
interstate branches are subject to many of the laws of the states in which they are located 
california law authorizes out of state banks to enter california by the acquisition of or merger with a california bank that has been in existence for at least five years  unless the california bank is in danger of failing or in certain other emergency situations 
interstate branching into california is  however  limited to the acquisition of an existing bank 
enforcement powers in addition to measures taken under the prompt corrective action provisions  insured banks may be subject to potential enforcement actions by the federal regulators for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses  or for violation of any law  rule  regulation or condition imposed in writing by the regulatory agency or term of a written agreement with the regulatory agency 
enforcement actions may include the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the bank the issuance of a cease and desist order that can be judicially enforced the termination of the bank s deposit insurance the imposition of civil monetary penalties  the issuance of directives to increase capital  the issuance of formal and informal agreements the issuance of removal and prohibition orders against officers  directors and other institution affiliated parties the enforcement of such actions through injunctions or restraining orders based upon a judicial determination that the deposit insurance fund or the bank would be harmed if such equitable relief was not granted fdic receivership the fdic may be appointed as conservator or receiver of any insured bank or savings association 
in addition  the fdic may appoint itself as sole conservator or receiver of any insured state bank or savings association for any  among others  of the following reasons insolvency substantial dissipation of assets or earnings due to any violation of law or regulation or any unsafe or unsound practice an unsafe or unsound condition to transact business  including substantially insufficient capital or otherwise any willful violation of a cease and desist order which has become final any concealment of books  papers  records or assets of the institution the likelihood that the institution will not be able to meet the demands of its depositors or pay its obligations in the normal course of business the incurrence or likely incurrence of losses by the institution that will deplete all or substantially all of its capital with no reasonable prospect for the replenishment of the capital without federal assistance any violation of any law or regulation  or an unsafe or unsound practice or condition which is likely to cause insolvency or substantial dissipation of assets or earnings  or is likely to weaken the condition of the institution or otherwise seriously prejudice the interests of its depositors 
as a receiver of any insured depository institution  the fdic may liquidate such institution in an orderly manner and dispose of any matter concerning such institution as the fdic determines is in the best interests of that institution  its depositors and the fdic 
further  the fdic will  as the conservator or receiver  by operation of law  succeed to all rights  titles  powers and privileges of the insured institution  and of any shareholder  member  account holder  depositor  officer or director of that institution with respect to the institution and the assets of the institution  may take over the assets of and operate the institution with all the powers of the members or shareholders  directors and the officers of the institution and conduct all business of the institution  and  collect all obligations and money due to the institution and preserve and conserve the assets and property of the institution 
safety and soundness guidelines the federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines to assist in identifying and addressing potential safety and soundness concerns before capital becomes impaired 
these guidelines establish operational and managerial standards relating to internal controls  information systems and internal audit systems loan documentation credit underwriting asset growth compensation  fees and benefits additionally  the federal banking agencies have adopted safety and soundness guidelines for asset quality and for evaluating and monitoring earnings to ensure that earnings are sufficient for the maintenance of adequate capital and reserves 
if an institution fails to comply with a safety and soundness standard  the appropriate federal banking agency may require the institution to submit a compliance plan 
failure to submit a compliance plan or to implement an accepted plan may result in a formal enforcement action 
the federal banking agencies have issued regulations prescribing uniform guidelines for real estate lending 
the regulations require insured depository institutions to adopt written policies establishing standards  consistent with such guidelines  for extensions of credit secured by real estate 
the policies must address loan portfolio management  underwriting standards and loan to value limits that do not exceed the supervisory limits prescribed by the regulations 
consumer protection laws and regulations the bank regulatory agencies are focusing greater attention on compliance with consumer protection laws and their implementing regulations 
examination and enforcement have become more intense in nature and insured institutions have been advised to carefully monitor compliance with various consumer protection laws and their implementing regulations 
banks are subject to many federal consumer protection laws and their regulations  including the community reinvestment act  or the cra the truth in lending act or the tila the fair housing act  or the fh act the equal credit opportunity act or the ecoa the home mortgage disclosure act  or the hmda the real estate settlement procedures act or the respa the gramm leach bliley act  or the glb act the cra is intended to encourage insured depository institutions  while operating safely and soundly  to help meet the credit needs of their communities 
the cra specifically directs the federal bank regulatory agencies  in examining insured depository institutions  to assess their record of helping to meet the credit needs of their entire community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods  consistent with safe and sound banking practices 
the cra further requires the agencies to take a financial institution s record of meeting its community redit needs into account when evaluating applications for  among other things  domestic branches  consummating mergers or acquisitions or holding company formations 
the federal banking agencies have adopted regulations which measure a bank s compliance with its cra obligations on a performance based evaluation system 
this system bases cra ratings on an institution s actual lending service and investment performance rather than the extent to which the institution conducts needs assessments  documents community outreach or complies with other procedural requirements 
the ratings range from a high of outstanding to a low of substantial noncompliance 
the ecoa prohibits discrimination in any credit transaction  whether for consumer or business purposes  on the basis of race  color  religion  national origin  sex  marital status  age except in limited circumstances  receipt of income from public assistance programs or good faith exercise of any rights under the consumer credit protection act 
the federal interagency task force on fair lending issued a policy statement on discrimination in lending 
the policy statement describes the three methods that federal agencies will use to prove discrimination overt evidence of discrimination evidence of disparate treatment evidence of disparate impact if a creditor s actions have had the effect of discriminating  the creditor may be held liable even when there is no intent to discriminate 
the fh act regulates many practices  including making it unlawful for any lender to discriminate against any person in its housing related lending activities because of race  color  religion  national origin  sex  handicap or familial status 
the fh act is broadly written and has been broadly interpreted by the courts 
a number of lending practices have been found to be  or may be considered  illegal under the fh act  including some that are not specifically mentioned in the fh act itself 
among those practices that have been found to be  or may be considered  illegal under the fh act are declining a loan for the purposes of racial discrimination making excessively low appraisals of property based on racial considerations pressuring  discouraging or denying applications for credit on a prohibited basis using excessively burdensome qualifications standards for the purpose or with the effect of denying housing to minority applicants imposing on minority loan applicants more onerous interest rates or other terms  conditions or requirements racial steering or deliberately guiding potential purchasers to or away from certain areas because of race the tila is designed to ensure that credit terms are disclosed in a meaningful way so that consumers may compare credit terms more readily and knowledgeably 
as a result of the tila  all creditors must use the same credit terminology and expressions of rates  the annual percentage rate  the finance charge  the amount financed  the total payments and the payment schedule 
hmda grew out of public concern over credit shortages in certain urban neighborhoods 
one purpose of hmda is to provide public information that will help show whether financial institutions are serving the housing credit needs of the neighborhoods and communities in which they are located 
hmda also includes a fair lending aspect that requires the collection and disclosure of data about applicant and borrower characteristics as a way of identifying possible discriminatory lending patterns and enforcing anti discrimination statutes 
hmda requires institutions to report data regarding applications for one to four family real estate loans  home improvement loans and multifamily loans  as well as information concerning originations and purchases of those types of loans 
federal bank regulators rely  in part  upon data provided under hmda to determine whether depository institutions engage in discriminatory lending practices 
respa requires lenders to provide borrowers with disclosures regarding the nature and costs of real estate settlements 
also  respa prohibits certain abusive practices  such as kickbacks  and places limitations on the amount of escrow accounts 
the glb act required disclosure of the bank s privacy policy at the time the customer relationship is established and annually thereafter

other aspects of banking law goleta is also subject to federal and state statutory and regulatory provisions covering  among other things  security procedures  currency and foreign transactions reporting  insider and affiliated party transactions  management interlocks  electronic funds transfers  funds availability and truth in savings 
there are also a variety of federal statutes which regulate acquisitions of control and the formation of bank holding companies 
impact of monetary policies banking is a business that depends on rate differentials 
in general  the difference between the interest rate paid by a bank on its deposits and its other borrowings and the interest rate earned on its loans  securities and other interest earning assets comprises the major source of goleta s earnings 
these rates are highly sensitive to many factors which are beyond goleta s control and  accordingly  the earnings and growth of goleta are subject to the influence of economic conditions generally  both domestic and foreign  including inflation  recession and unemployment and also to the influence of monetary and fiscal policies of the united states and its agencies  particularly the frb 
the frb implements national monetary policy  such as seeking to curb inflation and combat recession  by open market dealings in united states government securities adjusting the required level of reserves for financial institutions subject to reserve requirements placing limitations upon savings and time deposit interest rates adjusting the discount rate applicable to borrowings by banks which are members of the federal reserve system the actions of the frb in these areas influence the growth of bank loans  investments  and deposits and also affect interest rates 
since january  the frb has decreased interest rates numerous times 
the nature and timing of any future changes in the frb s policies and their impact on the company and goleta cannot be predicted  however  depending on the degree to which our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are rate sensitive  increases in rates would have a temporary effect of increasing our net interest margin  while decreases in interest rates would have the opposite effect 
in addition  adverse economic conditions could make a higher provision for loan losses a prudent course and could cause higher loan charge offs  thus adversely affecting our net income or other operating costs

significant accounting policies interest only strips and servicing assets the company originates certain loans for the purpose of selling either a portion of  or the entire loan  into the secondary market 
fha title loans and the guaranteed portion of sba loans are sold into the secondary market 
servicing assets are recognized as separate assets when loans are sold with servicing retained 
servicing assets are amortized in proportion to  and over the period of  estimated future net servicing income 
also  at the time of the loan sale  it is the company s policy to recognize the related gain on the loan sale in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the company uses industry prepayment statistics and its own prepayment experience in estimating the expected life of the loans 
quarterly  management evaluates servicing assets for impairment 
servicing assets are evaluated for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to amortized cost on a loan by loan basis 
fair value is determined using discounted future cash flows calculated on a loan by loan basis and aggregated to the total asset level 
impairment to the asset is recorded if the aggregate fair value calculation drops below net book value of the asset 
additionally  on some sba loan sales  the company has retained interest only i o strips  which represent the present value of excess net cash flows generated by the difference between a interest at the stated rate paid by borrowers and b the sum of i pass through interest paid to third party investors and ii contractual servicing fees 
the company determined the present value of this estimated cash flow at the time each loan sale transaction closed  utilizing valuation assumptions as to discount rate  prepayment rate and default rate appropriate for each particular transaction 
periodically  the company verifies the reasonableness of its valuation estimates by comparison to the results of an independent third party valuation analysis 
the i o strips are accounted for like investments in debt securities classified as trading securities 
accordingly  the company records the i o s at fair value with the resulting increase or decrease in fair value being recorded through operations in the current period 
for the years ended december   and  net decreases in fair value of   and  respectively  are included in results of operations as reductions to loan servicing income 
securitized loans and bonds payable in and  respectively  the company transferred million and million in loans to special purpose trusts trusts 
the transfers have been accounted for as secured borrowings with a pledge of collateral and  accordingly  the mortgage loans and related bonds issued are included in the company s balance sheet 
such loans are accounted for in the same manner as loans held to maturity 
deferred debt issuance costs and bond discount related to the bonds are amortized on a method which approximates the level yield basis over the estimated life of the bonds 
new accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board fasb finalized accounting standards covering business combinations  goodwill and intangible assets 
these new rules published in july consist of sfas no

in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets which supersedes sfas no 
sfas no 
 which governs accounting for the impairment of long lived assets  is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a significant impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities which nullifies emerging task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
this statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred and is effective for exit and disposal activities after december  under issue  a liability for exit cost as defined in issue was recognized at the date of the entity s commitment to an exit plan 
the fasb has concluded that an entity s commitment to a plan  by itself  does not create a present obligation to others that meet the definition of a liability 
therefore  this statement eliminates the definition and requirements for recognition of exit costs in issue this statement also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
the company did not elect to early adopt sfas no 
the company recognized  of costs related to exit and disposal activities in at december   the company had  in liabilities related to its exit and disposal activities 
refer to note for the components of the exit and disposal related items

 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in addition  sfas no 
amends sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  to include in its scope long term customer relationship intangible assets of financial institutions such as credit cardholder intangible assets 
sfas applies to acquisitions completed on or after october  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a significant impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in november  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  to clarify accounting and disclosure requirements relating to a guarantor s issuance of certain types of guarantees 
fin requires entities to disclose additional information about certain guarantees  or groups of similar guarantees  even if the likelihood of the guarantor s having to make any payments under the guarantee is remote 
the disclosure provisions are effective for financial statements for fiscal years ended after december  for certain guarantees  the interpretation also requires that guarantors recognize a liability equal to the fair value of the guarantee upon its issuance 
this initial recognition and measurement provision is to be applied only on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb no 
this statement amends sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  the statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company plans to continue to account for stock based employee compensation under the intrinsic value based method and to provide disclosure of the impact of the fair value based method on reported income 
employee stock options have characteristics that are significantly different from those of traded options  including vesting provisions and trading limitations that impact their liquidity

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company s primary market risk is interest rate risk irr 
to minimize the volatility of net interest earnings at risk nie and the impact on economic value of equity eve  the company manages its exposure to changes in interest rates through asset and liability management activities within guidelines established by its asset liability committee alco and approved by the board of directors 
alco has the responsibility for approving and ensuring compliance with asset liability management policies  including irr exposure 
to mitigate the impact of changes in interest rates on the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the company actively manages the amounts and maturities 
we generally retain short term  adjustable rate assets as they have similar re pricing characteristics as our funding sources 
the company sells mortgage products and a portion of its sba loan originations 
while the company has some interest rate exposure in excess of five years  it has internal policy limits designed to minimize risk should interest rates rise 
currently  the company does not use derivative instruments to help manage risk  but will consider such instruments in the future if the perceived need should arise 
to analyze irr for nie and eve  the company uses on a quarterly basis  computer modeling to forecast simulate the effects of both higher and lower interest rates 
the model develops a month forecast of earnings and the current economic value of assets  liabilities and equity are determined given an assumption of flat interest rates 
for purposes of an up rate shock simulation  an assumption is made that market interest rates will be higher than the forecast by basis points for all points on the yield curve 
and for purposes of a down rate shock simulation  an assumption is made that the market interest rates will be lower than forecast by basis points for all points on the yield curve 
december  rates up basis points net interest earnings at risk nie equity value at risk of eve rates down basis points net interest earnings at risk nie equity value at risk of eve the above table illustrates that the company has effectively managed its irr during both years presented 
for september   the latest period for which comparisons are available  the company s up and down basis points scenarios for nie and eve are less meaning less measured interest rate risk than the average for peer banks in the million to million range

as a result  the company reversed previously consolidated losses in and reflected the remaining investment at cost  which was zero 
on october   the company sold its remaining  shares of stock to ace cash express incorporated ace for  investment securities the company purchases securities with funds not needed for immediate liquidity or lending purposes 
these debt securities are classified as held to maturity as the company has the positive intent and ability to hold them to maturity 
securities held to maturity are accounted for at amortized cost 
those debt securities to be held for indefinite periods of time  usually not to maturity  are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of any applicable income taxes 
realized gains or losses on the sale of securities available for sale  if any  are determined on a specific identification basis 
purchase premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income using the effective interest method over the terms of the related securities  or to earlier call dates  if appropriate 
declines in the fair value of available for sale or held to maturity securities below their cost that are deemed to be other than temporary  if any  are reflected in earnings as realized losses

fha title loans and the guaranteed portion of certain sba loans are sold into the secondary market 
servicing assets are recognized as separate assets when loans are sold with servicing retained 
servicing assets are amortized in proportion to  and over the period of  estimated future net servicing income 
also  at the time of the loan sale  it is the company s policy to recognize the related gain on the loan sale in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the company uses industry prepayment statistics and its own prepayment experience in estimating the expected life of the loans 
management periodically evaluates servicing assets for impairment 
servicing assets are evaluated for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to amortized cost on a loan by loan basis 
fair value is determined using discounted future cash flows calculated on a loan by loan basis and aggregated to the total asset level 
impairment to the asset is recorded if the aggregate fair value calculation drops below net book value of the asset 
f additionally  on some sba loan sales  the company has retained interest only i o strips  which represent the present value of excess net cash flows generated by the difference between a interest at the stated rate paid by borrowers and b the sum of i pass through interest paid to third party investors and ii contractual servicing fees 
prior to april   the company determined the present value of this estimated cash flow at the time each loan sale transaction closed  utilizing valuation assumptions as to discount rate  prepayment rate and default rate appropriate for each particular transaction 
for loans sold after march   the initial servicing assets and resulting gain on sale were calculated based on the difference between the best actual par and premium bids on an individual loan basis 
this same methodology would apply to the initial valuation of any new i o strip assets 
as the company did not sell any loans for par after march  there were no additions to the i o strips using the new assumptions 
periodically  the company verifies the reasonableness of its valuation estimates by comparison to the results of an independent third party valuation analysis 
the i o strips are classified as trading securities 
accordingly  the company records the i o s strips at fair value with the resulting increase or decrease in fair value being recorded through operations in the current period 
for the years ended december   and  net decreases in fair value of   and  respectively  are included in the income statement as reductions to loan servicing income 
loans held for sale loans which are originated and intended for sale in the secondary market are carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value determined on an aggregate basis 
valuation adjustments  if any  are recognized through a valuation allowance by charges to lower of cost or market provision 
the company does not utilize any specific hedging instruments to minimize exposure to fluctuations in the market price of loans and interest rates with regard to loans held for sale in the secondary mortgage market 
loans held for sale are primarily comprised of sba loans  second mortgage loans and residential mortgage loans 
for the year ended december  the company had a lower of cost or market provision of  the company did not incurr a lower of cost or market provision in the years ended december  and loans held for investment loans are carried at amounts advanced to the borrowers less the payments collected 
interest on loans is accrued daily on a simple interest basis 
the accrual of interest is discontinued when substantial doubt exists as to collectibility of the loan  generally at the time the loan is days delinquent  unless the credit is well secured and in process of collection 
any unpaid but accrued interest is reversed at that time 
thereafter  interest income is no longer recognized on the loan 
interest on non accrual loans is accounted for on the cash basis or cost recovery method  until qualifying for return to accrual 
loans are returned to accrual status when all of the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured 
impaired loans are identified as impaired when it is probable that interest and principal will not be collected according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
all of the company s nonaccrual loans were also classified as impaired at december  and securitized loans and bonds payable in and  respectively  the company transferred million and million in loans to special purpose trusts trusts 
the transfers have been accounted for as secured borrowings and  accordingly  the mortgage loans and related bonds issued are included in the company s balance sheet 
such loans are accounted for in the same manner as loans held to maturity 
deferred debt issuance costs and bond discount related to the bonds are amortized on a method which approximates the level yield method over the estimated life of the bonds 
loan fees and costs loan origination fees  certain direct origination costs and purchase premiums and discounts are deferred and recognized as an adjustment to the loan yield over the life of the loan using the level yield method 
provision and allowance for loan losses the company maintains a detailed  systematic analysis and procedural discipline to determine the amount of the allowance for loan losses all 
the all is based on estimates and is intended to be adequate to provide for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
this process involves deriving probable loss estimates that are based on individual loan loss estimation  migration analysis historical loss rates and management s judgment 
the company employs several methodologies for estimating probable losses 
methodologies are determined based on a number of factors  including type of asset  credit score  concentrations  collateral value and the input of the special assets group  functioning as a workout unit 
the all calculation for the different major loan types is as follows sba all loans are reviewed and classified loans are assigned a specific allowance 
those not assigned to a watch list category are classified as pass 
a migration analysis is then used to calculate the required allowance on those pass loans 
f relationship banking includes commercial and real estate mortgage loans originated by the branch locations 
classified loans are assigned a specific allowance 
a migration analysis is then used to calculate the required allowance on the remaining pass loans 
short term consumer loans classified as a homogeneous portfolio and the allowance calculated based on past due statistics and past charge off history 
manufactured housing an allowance is calculated based on a review of delinquency statistics 
securitized loans the company considers this a homogeneous portfolio  and calculates the allowance based on statistical information provided by the servicer 
charge off history is calculated based on methodologies  a month and a month historical trend and by delinquency information 
the highest requirement of the methods is used 
other real estate owned other real estate owned oreo is real estate acquired through foreclosure on the collateral property and is recorded at fair value at the time of foreclosure less estimated costs to sell 
any excess of loan balance over the fair value of the oreo is charged off against the allowance for loan losses 
subsequent to foreclosure  management periodically performs new valuations and assets are carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value 
operating expenses or income  and gains or losses on disposition of such properties  are charged to current operations 
premises and equipment premises and equipment are stated at cost  less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the terms of the leases or the estimated useful lives of the improvements  whichever is shorter 
generally  the estimated useful lives of other items of premises and equipment are as follows building and improvements years furniture and equipment years electronic equipment and software years income taxes deferred income taxes are recognized for the tax effect of differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
a valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets if  based on weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
income loss per share basic income loss per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during each year divided into net income loss 
diluted income loss per share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares outstanding during each year plus the dilutive effect  if any  of outstanding options divided into net income 
stock based compensation gaap permits the company to use either of two methodologies to account for compensation cost in connection with employee stock options 
the first method requires issuers to record compensation expense over the period the options are expected to be outstanding prior to exercise  expiration or cancellation 
the amount of compensation expense to be recognized over this term is the fair value of the options at the time of the grant as determined by the black scholes valuation model 
the black scholes model computes fair value of the options based on the length of their term  the volatility of the stock price in past periods and other factors 
under this method  the issuer recognizes compensation expense regardless of whether the employee eventually exercises the options 
under the second methodology  if options are granted at an exercise price equal to the market value of the stock at the time of the grant  no compensation expense is recognized 
the company believes that this method better reflects the motivation for its issuance of stock options  as they are intended as incentives for future performance rather than compensation for past performance 
gaap requires that issuers electing the second method must present pro forma disclosure of net income and earnings per share as if the first method had been elected 
the company presents these disclosures in note f statement of cash flows for purposes of reporting cash flows  cash and cash equivalents include cash  due from banks and federal funds sold 
federal funds sold are one day transactions with the company s funds being returned the following business day 
reserve requirements all depository institutions are required by law to maintain reserves on transaction accounts and non personal time deposits in the form of cash balances at the federal reserve bank 
these reserve requirements can be offset by cash balances held at the bank 
at december  and  the bank s cash balance was sufficient to offset the federal reserve requirement 
use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
these estimates and assumptions also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
although management believes these estimates to be reasonably accurate  actual results may differ 
certain amounts in the accompanying financial statements for and statements have been reclassified to be comparable with classifications in the financial statements

this statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred and is effective for exit and disposal activities after december  under issue  a liability for exit cost as defined in issue was recognized at the date of the entity s commitment to an exit plan 
the fasb has concluded that an entity s commitment to a plan  by itself  does not create a present obligation to others that meet the definition of a liability 
therefore  this statement eliminates the definition and requirements for recognition of exit costs in issue this statement also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
the company did not elect to early adopt sfas no 
the company recognized  of costs related to exit and disposal activities in at december   the company had  in accrued liabilities related to its exit and disposal activities all of which relate to liabilities that had been incurred at december  accordingly  the adoption of sfas no

fin requires entities to disclose additional information about certain guarantees  or groups of similar guarantees  even if the likelihood of the guarantor s having to make any payments under the guarantee is remote 
the disclosure provisions are effective for financial statements for fiscal years ended after december  for certain guarantees  the interpretation also requires that guarantors recognize a liability equal to the fair value of the guarantee upon its issuance

accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb no 
this statement amends sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation sfas no

in addition  the statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company plans to continue to account for stock based employee compensation under apb to provide disclosure of the impact of the fair value based method on reported income 
employee stock options have characteristics that are significantly different from those of traded options  including vesting provisions and trading limitations that impact their liquidity

fair values of financial instruments the estimated fair values of financial instruments have been determined by the company using available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies 
however  considerable judgment is required to interpret market data to develop estimates of fair value 
accordingly  the estimates presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts the company could realize in a current market exchange 
the use of different market assumptions and or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts 
f the following table represents the estimated fair values december  carrying estimated carrying estimated amount fair value amount fair value in thousands assets cash and cash equivalents     time deposits in other financial institutions     investment securities   interest only strips     servicing assets     net loans     liabilities deposits other than time deposits     time deposits     bonds payable     the methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value are explained below cash and cash equivalents the carrying amounts approximate fair value because of the short term nature of these instruments 
time deposits in other financial institutions the carrying amounts approximate fair value because of the relative short term nature of these  generally less than day terms 
investment securities the fair value is based on quoted market prices from security brokers or dealers if available 
if a quoted market price is not available  fair value is estimated using the quoted market price for similar securities 
federal reserve and federal home loan bank stock carrying value approximates the fair value because the stock can be sold back to the federal reserve and federal home loan bank at anytime 
loans the fair value of loans is estimated for portfolios of loans with similar financial characteristics  primarily fixed and adjustable rate interest terms 
the fair value of fixed rate mortgage loans is based upon discounted cash flows utilizing the rate that the company currently offers as well as anticipated prepayment schedules 
the fair value of adjustable rate loans is also based upon discounted cash flows utilizing discount rates that the company currently offers  as well as anticipated prepayment schedules 
no adjustments have been made for changes in credit within the loan portfolio 
the fair value of loans held for sale is determined based on quoted market prices or dealer quotes 
interest only strip the fair value of the interest only strip has been determined by the discounted cash flow method  using market discount and prepayment rates 
servicing assets the carrying amounts approximate fair value because quarterly  management evaluates servicing assets for impairment 
servicing assets are evaluated for impairment based upon the fair value of the rights as compared to amortized cost on a loan by loan basis 
fair value is determined using discounted future cash flows calculated on a loan by loan basis and aggregated to the total asset level 
impairment to the asset is recorded if the aggregate fair value calculation drops below net book value of the asset 
deposits the fair values of deposits are estimated based upon the type of deposit products 
demand accounts  which include savings and transaction accounts  are presumed to have equal book and fair values  since the interest rates paid on these accounts are based on prevailing market rates 
the estimated fair values of time deposits are determined by discounting the cash flows of segments of deposits that have similar maturities and rates  utilizing a yield curve that approximates the prevailing rates offered to depositors as of the measurement date 
bonds payable the fair value is estimated using discounted cash flow analysis based on rates for similar types of borrowing arrangements 
commitments to extend credit  commercial and standby letters of credit due to the proximity of the pricing of these commitments to the period end the fair values of commitments are immaterial to the financial statements 
f the fair value estimates presented herein are based on pertinent information available to management as of december  and although management is not aware of any factors that would significantly affect the estimated fair value amounts  such amounts have not been comprehensively revalued for purposes of these financial statements since those dates and  therefore  current estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the amounts presented herein 
regulatory matters the company on a consolidated basis and goleta are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on the company s and goleta s financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  the company and goleta must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the company s and goleta s assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the company s and goleta s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors 
prompt corrective action provisions are not applicable to bank holding companies 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act  fdicia  was signed into law on december  fdicia included significant changes to the legal and regulatory environment for insured depository institutions  including reductions in insurance coverage for certain kinds of deposits  increased supervision by the federal regulatory agencies  increased reporting requirements for insured institutions and new regulations concerning internal controls  accounting and operations 
the prompt corrective action regulations of fdicia  define specific capital categories based on the institutions capital ratios 
the capital categories  in declining order  are well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized  and critically undercapitalized 
to be considered well capitalized an institution must have a core capital ratio of at least and a total risk based capital ratio of at least 
additionally  fdicia imposes tier i risk based capital ratio of at least to be considered well capitalized 
tier i risk based capital is  primarily  common stock and retained earnings net of goodwill and other intangible assets

under the regulatory framework  until the regulatory agencies agreement is lifted and the regulatory agencies notify goleta that it is deemed well capitalized  goleta may not accept brokered deposits without prior approval from the regulators 
goleta had no brokered deposits at december  or in october  goleta entered into a stipulation for the entry of a consent order consent order with its principal regulator  the occ 
as of this date  the consent order replaced the formal agreement that goleta was previously operating under with the occ 
the consent order requires that goleta maintain certain capital levels  adhere to certain operational and reporting requirements  and take certain actions  including the following submit monthly progress reports on or before december   cease all origination  renewal  or rollover of short term consumer loans and receive indemnification from ace for costs  expenses  legal fees  damages and related liabilities from third party claims in certain circumstances as specified in and in accordance with the terms of the agreement with ace maintain total capital at least equal to of risk weighted assets and tier capital at least equal to of adjusted total assets  develop a three year capital program to maintain adequate capital and refrain from paying dividends without the approval of the occ develop a written profit plan and submit quarterly performance reports  develop and implement a written risk management program and adopt general procedures addressing compliance management  internal control systems and education of employees regarding laws  rules and regulations f document the information it has relied on to value loans held on its books  servicing rights  deferred tax assets and liabilities and interest only assets  and submit the documentation to the occ on a quarterly basis correct each violation of law  rule or regulation cited in any report of examination where possible and implement corrective action to avoid the reoccurrence of any such violations obtain approval from the occ before it initiates any new product or service or significantly expands any of its existing products or services compliance with the provisions of the consent order could limit goleta s business activity and increase expense 
in march  the company entered into the memorandum of understanding mou with its principal regulator  the federal reserve bank of san francisco reserve bank 
the mou requires that the company maintain certain capital levels and adhere to certain operational and reporting requirements  including the following refrain from declaring any dividends or redeeming any of the company s stock without the approval of the reserve bank adopting a written plan to maintain a sufficient capital position for the consolidated organization  refrain from increasing the company s borrowings or incurring or renewing any debt without the approval of the reserve bank correcting any violations of applicable laws  rules or regulations and developing a written program to ensure compliance in the future developing written policies and procedures to strengthen the company s records  systems and internal controls developing a written plan to enhance management information systems and the board of director s supervision of operations  developing a written consolidated strategic plan developing a written plan to address weaknesses in the company s audit program complying with applicable laws with respect to the appointment of any new directors or the hiring of any senior executive officers submitting quarterly progress reports under the terms of both the formal agreement and the consent order  goleta is required to achieve and maintain total capital at least equal to of total risk weighted assets  and tier i capital at least equal to of adjusted total assets 
goleta has maintained a total risk weight assets ratio of over and tier capital of above during and ended the year with a total risk based ratio of 
the company believes that it is in full compliance with all of the provisions of the consent order and the mou 
commitments and contingencies commitments the company is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet 
the company s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual notional amount of those instruments 
at december  and  the company had commitments to extend credit of approximately  and  respectively  including obligations to extend standby letters of credit of approximately  and  respectively 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
those guarantees are primarily issued to support private borrowing arrangements 
all guarantees are short term and expire within one year 
the company uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for extending loan facilities to customers 
the company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary by the company upon extension of f credit  is based on management s credit evaluation of the counterparty 
collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant and equipment and income producing commercial properties 
loans sold the company has sold loans that are guaranteed or insured by government agencies for which the company retains all servicing rights and responsibilities 
the company is required to perform certain monitoring functions in connection with these loans to preserve the guarantee by the government agency and prevent loss to the company in the event of nonperformance by the borrower 
management believes that the company is in compliance with these requirements 
the outstanding balance of the sold portion of such loans was approximately  and  at december  and  respectively 
although the company sells without recourse substantially all of the mortgage loans it originates or purchases  the company retains a substantial degree of risk relating to the servicing activities and retained interest in sold sba loans 
in addition  during the period of time that the loans are held for sale  the company is subject to various business risks associated with the lending business  including borrower default  foreclosure and the risk that a rapid increase in interest rates would result in a decline of the value of loans held for sale to potential purchasers 
in connection with its loan sales  the company enters agreements which generally require the company to repurchase or substitute loans in the event of a breach of a representation or warranty made by the company to the loan purchaser  any misrepresentation during the mortgage loan origination process or  in some cases  upon any fraud or early default on such mortgage loans 
salary continuation the company has a salary continuation agreement with a former officer and director 
the agreement provides monthly cash payments to the officer or beneficiaries in the event of death  disability or retirement  beginning in the month after the retirement date or death and extending for a period of fifteen years 
the company purchased a life insurance policy as an investment 
the income from the policy investment will help offset this liability 
the cash surrender value of the policy was  and  at december  and  respectively  and is included in other assets 
the present value of the company s liability under the agreement is included in accrued interest payable and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the accrued salary continuation liability was  and  at december  and  respectively 
the company also has two key man life insurance policies 
the combined cash surrender value of the policies are  and  at december  and  respectively 
litigation the following sections summarize the company s significant legal proceedings 
short term consumer lending throughout  and  goleta made short term consumer loans bank loans using certain marketing and servicing assistance of ace at almost all of ace s retail locations pursuant to the terms of a master loan agency agreement between ace and goleta goleta agreement 
however  in october goleta and ace entered into separate consent orders with the occ 
in connection with its consent order  goleta agreed to discontinue making bank loans  effective december   and paid a civil money penalty of  a number of lawsuits and state regulatory proceedings have been filed or initiated against goleta and or ace regarding the bank loans 
the state regulatory proceedings have all been settled without goleta incurring any liability for settlement payments 
however  together with ace  goleta remains a defendant in three class actions  including a nationwide class action brought in a federal court in texas and two statewide class actions brought in state courts in florida and maryland 
a key issue in the remaining class actions concerning the bank loans is whether goleta or ace is properly regarded as the lender 
goleta and ace maintain that  as provided by the legal documentation and marketing materials for the bank loans  goleta is the lender and that  because goleta is a national bank located in california  the bank loans  including the interest that may legally be charged  should be governed by federal and california law 
the plaintiffs  however  maintain that ace should be regarded as the lender  because of the services it renders to goleta under the goleta agreement and ace s purchase of participation interests in the bank loans  and that the bank loans  including interest that may legally be charged  should be governed by the laws of the respective states in which the borrowers reside 
if ace were held to be the lender  then the interest charged for the bank loans would violate most of the applicable states usury laws  which impose maximum rates of interest or finance charges that a non bank lender may charge 
f the consequences to ace of an adverse holding in one or more of the pending lawsuits would depend on the applicable state s usury and consumer protection laws and on the basis for a finding of violation of those laws 
those consequences could include ace s obligation to refund interest collected on the bank loans  to refund the principal amount of the bank loans  to pay treble or other multiple damages and or to pay monetary penalties specified by statute
