for financial information about industry segments including foreign and domestic operations and export sales  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
marketing and sales in the united states  the company markets the largest portion of its products directly through its own sales and distribution organizations  although a few products and services are marketed through independent distributors and sales representatives 
sales to major markets outside the united states are generally made by the company s foreign based sales and service staff  although some export sales are made directly from the united states to foreign customers 
in addition  in certain foreign countries  sales are made through various representative and distributorship arrangements 
the company maintains sales and service offices in strategic regional locations in the united states and  through its sales subsidiaries  in key foreign locations 
the markets in which the company competes are  for the most part  global 
sales outside of north america accounted for   and of sales for fiscal years   and  respectively 
as a result  the company s customers increasingly require service and support on a worldwide basis 
in addition to the united states  the company has sales and service offices located throughout europe  asia  and latin america 
the company has invested substantial financial and management resources to develop an international infrastructure to meet the needs of its customers worldwide 
demand for the company s products depends on many factors  including the level of capital expenditures of the company s customers  the rate of economic growth in the company s major markets  and competitive considerations 
no single customer accounted for or more of the company s sales in fiscal year   or the company experiences some cyclical patterns in sales of its products 
generally  sales and earnings in the first quarter of the company s fiscal year are lower when compared to the preceding fourth fiscal quarter  primarily because there are fewer working days in the first fiscal quarter october to december and many customers defer december deliveries until the next calendar year  the company s second fiscal quarter 
the company s fourth fiscal quarter sales and earnings are often the highest in the fiscal year compared to the other three quarters  primarily because many customers spend budgeted money before their own fiscal years end 
this cyclical pattern can be influenced by other factors  including general economic conditions  acquisitions  and new product introductions 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the company believes that it differentiates its products from those of its competitors by its responsiveness to customer requirements  as determined through market research 
although specific customer requirements can vary depending on applications  customers generally demand superior performance  high quality  high productivity  and low cost of ownership 
the company has responded to these customer demands by introducing new products focused on these requirements in the markets it serves 
for example  customers of scientific instruments products have demanded higher levels of analytical throughput to support their research programs aimed at drug discovery and advanced life sciences 
the company has responded to these needs by introducing products with higher levels of automation and computerized data analysis routines 
backlog the company s recorded backlog was million at october   million at september   and million at september  backlog decreased from september  to october  primarily due to the recognition of revenue during fiscal year on several leading edge nmr systems and accessories that were previously deferred pending delivery and or customer acceptance 
backlog decreased from september  to september  primarily due to a trend toward shorter customer lead times in electronics manufacturing  this trend was a result of customers adopting more efficient ordering and production processes as well as their order visibility due to the difficult economic conditions during fiscal year to a lesser degree  the decrease in backlog from fiscal year to fiscal year was also due to the fact that the company began recognizing revenue on certain leading edge nmr systems during fiscal year the company includes in backlog purchase orders or production releases under blanket purchase orders that have firm delivery dates 
recorded backlog in us dollars is impacted by foreign currency fluctuations 
in addition  recorded backlog might not result in sales because of cancellations or other factors 
most of the company s products are shipped soon after they are ordered by customers  with the time between order receipt and shipment being as short as a few days for some products and less than a fiscal quarter for most others 
significant shipments often occur in the last month of each quarter  in part because of how customers place orders and schedule shipments 
the company believes that over of orders included in the backlog at october  will result in sales before the end of fiscal year competition competition in markets served by the scientific instruments and vacuum technologies segments is primarily based upon the performance capabilities of products  technical support and after market service  the manufacturer s reputation as a technological leader  and product pricing 
the company believes that performance capabilities are the most important of these criteria 
with respect to markets served by the electronics manufacturing segment  competition is primarily based upon assembly and test capabilities  technical expertise and support  flexibility and responsiveness of logistics management capabilities  the manufacturer s financial stability  and product pricing 
the company believes that technical expertise and support are the most important of these criteria 
the markets in which the company competes are highly competitive and are characterized by the application of advanced technology 
there are numerous companies that specialize in  and a number of larger companies that devote a significant portion of their resources to  the development  manufacture  sale  and service of products that compete with those manufactured  sold  or serviced by the company 
many of the company s competitors are well known manufacturers with a high degree of technical proficiency 
in addition  competition is intensified by the ever changing nature of the technologies in the industries in which the company is engaged 
the markets for the company s products are characterized by specialized manufacturers that often have strength in narrow segments of these markets 
while the absence of reliable statistics makes it difficult to determine the company s relative market position in its industry segments  the company is one of the principal manufacturers in its primary fields

the pre spin results also include allocations of certain vai corporate expenses to ib 
these amounts were allocated to ib on a basis that was considered by management to reflect most fairly or reasonably the utilization of the services provided to or the benefit obtained by ib 
typical measures and activity indicators used for allocation purposes included headcount  sales revenue  and payroll expense 
the company s management believes that the methods used to allocate these amounts were reasonable 
however  these allocations were not necessarily indicative of the amounts that would have been recorded by the company on a stand alone basis 
for fiscal year  earnings per share were calculated assuming that the weighted average number of shares outstanding prior to april  equaled the number of shares of common stock outstanding as of the distribution on april  also  for computing diluted earnings per share for the same period  the additional shares issuable upon exercise of stock options were determined using the treasury stock method based on the number of replacement stock options issued as of the distribution on april

the company s fiscal years reported are the or week periods which ended on the friday nearest september fiscal year comprised the week period ended on october  fiscal year comprised the week period ended on september  fiscal year comprised the week period ended on september  results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year sales 
sales were million in fiscal year  an increase of from sales of million in fiscal year sales by the scientific instruments  vacuum technologies  and electronics manufacturing segments increased by   and  respectively 
geographically  sales in north america of million  europe of million  and the rest of the world of million in fiscal year represented increases decreases of   and  respectively  as compared to fiscal year the decrease in north america resulted primarily from a shift in nmr system sales from north america to europe and the pacific rim 
this decrease was partially offset by higher sales in north america by the rest of the scientific instruments segment 
the increase in europe was primarily the result of stronger scientific instruments sales  due in part to the stronger euro 
the increase in the rest of the world was primarily driven by continued growth in scientific instrument sales into the pacific rim 
gross profit 
gross profit was million representing of sales in fiscal year  compared to million representing of sales in fiscal year the increase in gross profit was driven primarily by higher scientific instruments sales in fiscal year the gross profit percentage was slightly higher in fiscal year due to an increase in the gross profit margin for electronics manufacturing due to improved operational efficiencies 
this increase was partially offset by increased sales of newer leading edge scientific instruments products  which had lower margins due to higher installation and warranty costs 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses were million representing of sales in fiscal year  compared to million representing of sales in fiscal year the increase in sales and marketing expenses resulted primarily from the acquisition of ansys technologies  inc ansys in february and the non clinical  drugs of abuse testing business the dat business of roche diagnostics corporation in january the increase is also attributable to costs associated with higher revenues as well as the weaker us dollar  which increased costs for most sales and marketing resources based in non us locations 

table of contents 
index to financial statements research and development 
research and development expenses were million representing of sales in fiscal year  compared to million representing of sales in fiscal year research and development expenses increased from fiscal year primarily because the company continued to increase its focus within the scientific instruments and vacuum technologies segments on new product development with an emphasis on life science applications 
the weaker us dollar also contributed to the increase  as costs relating to certain non us based research and development resources were higher 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million representing of sales in fiscal year  compared to million representing of sales in fiscal year the increase in general and administrative expenses resulted primarily from higher expenses related to acquired businesses  higher insurance and corporate compliance costs  pretax restructuring costs of million  and pretax patent suit settlement costs of million discussed more fully in item legal proceedings 
the restructuring costs were incurred in connection with actions undertaken during fiscal year to improve efficiency and more closely align employee skill sets with the company s evolving product mix as the company continues to emphasize products targeted toward life science applications 
the restructuring actions primarily involved the termination of approximately employees and the closure of three sales offices 
in the aggregate  personnel related costs made up million of these costs  while facilities related costs totaled million 
also  amortization of acquisition related intangible assets increased to million in fiscal year from million in the prior year as a result of the ansys and dat business acquisitions 
purchased in process research and development 
in connection with the acquisition of ansys in february  the company recorded a one time pretax charge of million for purchased in process research and development relating to several ansys products that were in process at the time of the acquisition 
no such charges were recorded during fiscal year net interest expense 
net interest expense was million representing of sales in fiscal year  compared to million representing of sales in fiscal year the decrease in net interest expense resulted primarily from an increase in interest income due to higher levels of invested cash 
income tax expense 
the effective income tax rate was for fiscal year  compared to excluding the impact of the purchased in process research and development charge for fiscal year the fiscal year rate was lower than the fiscal year rate due mainly to a reduction in tax rates and higher tax credits in certain foreign jurisdictions 
net earnings 
net earnings were million net earnings per diluted share in fiscal year  compared to net earnings of million net earnings per diluted share in fiscal year net earnings for fiscal year reflect the impact of pretax restructuring costs of million and pretax patent suit settlement costs of million  while net earnings for fiscal year include the impact of a one time pretax charge of million for purchased in process research and development relating to the ansys acquisition 
excluding the effect of these costs  the increase in net earnings in fiscal year was primarily the result of increased profitability in the scientific instruments and electronics manufacturing segments  partially offset by lower profitability in the vacuum technologies segment and higher corporate costs

excluding the impact of these costs  the decrease in operating earnings as a percentage of sales in fiscal year resulted primarily from increased spending on research and development  legal expenses relating to the patent suit  and some impact of a weaker us dollar 
electronics manufacturing sales in fiscal year of million increased from fiscal year sales of million 
the revenue increase was due primarily to the acquisition of comtel in the third quarter of fiscal year and increased sales to industrial customers 
earnings from operations in fiscal year of million of sales increased from million of sales in fiscal year operating earnings for fiscal year reflect million in pretax acquisition related transition costs 
excluding the impact of these costs  the increase in operating earnings as a percentage of sales in fiscal year was due to improved operational efficiencies in fiscal year with respect to consolidated results for fiscal year  the company expects net earnings per diluted share to be between and on a us gaap basis  including anticipated restructuring costs of approximately million relating to the consolidation of three consumable products factories into one in southern california 
the company currently anticipates that approximately million of these restructuring costs will be incurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal year fiscal year compared to fiscal year sales

geographically  sales in north america of million  europe of million  and the rest of the world of million in fiscal year represented increases decreases of   and  respectively  as compared to fiscal year the increase in north america primarily resulted from an increase in scientific instruments sales 
this increase was partially offset by the sales decline in vacuum technologies 
the increase in europe was primarily driven by growth in scientific instruments sales 
the decrease in the rest of the world was primarily due to the decline of vacuum technologies sales into the pacific rim and  to a lesser degree  lower scientific instruments demand in latin america 
gross profit 
gross profit was million representing of sales in fiscal year  compared to million representing of sales in fiscal year the increase in gross profit percentage was driven primarily by higher electronics manufacturing gross profit margins as a result of improved operational efficiency in fiscal year and higher costs from integrating an acquisition and higher start up costs for new customers in fiscal year this increase in fiscal year was partially offset by a lower gross profit percentage for vacuum technologies  which was negatively impacted by lower sales to industrial capital equipment and semiconductor equipment customers  and a lower gross profit percentage for scientific instruments  due to proportionally higher revenues from nmr systems  which had lower gross profit margins but similar operating profit margins compared to the overall segment 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses were million representing of sales in fiscal year  compared to million representing of sales in fiscal year the decline as a percentage of sales resulted primarily from increased scientific instruments sales  particularly high field nmr systems  which typically generate lower sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of sales 
the decline is also attributable to programs undertaken in the second half of fiscal year to reduce sales and marketing costs

index to financial statements research and development 
research and development expenses were million representing of sales in fiscal year  compared to million representing of sales in fiscal year research and development expenses increased from fiscal year primarily because the company continued to increase its focus within the scientific instruments segment on new product development for life science applications 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million representing of sales in fiscal year  compared to million representing of sales in fiscal year during fiscal year  general and administrative expenses included million in amortization of intangible assets  compared to million in amortization of goodwill and intangible assets in fiscal year the decrease in amortization resulted primarily from the company s adoption at the beginning of fiscal year of financial accounting standards board the fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas  goodwill and other intangible assets  eliminating the amortization of goodwill  which was partially offset by new amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions made in the first half of fiscal year purchased in process research and development 
in connection with the acquisition of ansys in february  the company recorded a one time charge of million for purchased in process research and development relating to several ansys products that were in process at the time of the acquisition 
no such charges were recorded during fiscal year net interest expense 
net interest expense was million representing of sales in fiscal year  compared to million representing of sales in fiscal year the increase in net interest expense resulted primarily from lower interest rates on invested cash 
income tax expense 
the effective income tax rate was excluding the impact of the purchased in process research and development charge for fiscal year  compared to for fiscal year the fiscal year rate was lower than the fiscal year rate due mainly to reductions in tax rates in non us jurisdictions where the company has significant manufacturing operations

scientific instruments sales of million in fiscal year increased over fiscal year sales of million 
the revenue growth was primarily driven by increased sales of nmr systems  certain products selling into life science applications which accounted for approximately of scientific instruments sales  compared to approximately in the prior year  and the ansys acquisition in the second quarter of fiscal year excluding sales from this and other businesses acquired in fiscal year  sales in fiscal year increased by approximately from fiscal year earnings from operations in fiscal year were million of sales 
excluding the purchased in process research and development charge  earnings from operations of million of sales increased from million of sales in fiscal year  primarily as a result of increased sales of products targeted toward life science applications and revenues from after market products and services  all of which typically have higher operating margins 
during fiscal year  operating expenses for scientific instruments included million in amortization of intangible assets  compared to million in amortization of goodwill and intangible assets in fiscal year the decrease in amortization resulted primarily from the company s adoption at the beginning of fiscal year of fas  eliminating the amortization of goodwill  which was partially offset by new amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions made in the first half of fiscal year vacuum technologies sales of million in fiscal year decreased from fiscal year sales of million 
the revenue decrease was caused primarily by weak demand from semiconductor equipment and other industrial capital equipment manufacturers 
earnings from operations in fiscal year of million of sales were down from the million of sales in fiscal year the lower earnings were primarily the result of lower sales in fiscal year 
table of contents 
index to financial statements electronics manufacturing sales in fiscal year of million decreased from fiscal year sales of million 
the revenue decrease from the prior year period was caused by weaker demand from communications and industrial customers  largely offset by increased sales to life science such as health care equipment companies which accounted for approximately of electronics manufacturing sales  compared to approximately in the prior year 
earnings from operations in fiscal year of million of sales increased from million of sales in fiscal year the higher earnings in fiscal year were due to improved operational efficiency in fiscal year and higher costs from integrating an acquisition and higher start up costs relating to new customers in fiscal year critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to exercise certain judgments in selecting and applying accounting policies and methods 
following is a summary of what management considers to be the company s most critical accounting policies those that are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations and that require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments the effects of those accounting policies applied  and the judgments made in their application 
revenue recognition 
the company derives revenues from three primary sources system sales  parts sales  and service contracts 
the company recognizes revenue on system sales and parts sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the contract price is fixed or determinable  the product has been delivered  title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
the company s sales are typically not subject to rights of return and  historically  actual sales returns have not been significant 
system sales that do not involve unique customer acceptance terms or new specifications or technology with customer acceptance provisions  and that involve installation services  are accounted for as multiple element arrangements  where the larger of the contractual billing hold back or the fair value of the installation service is deferred when the product is delivered and subsequently recognized when the installation is complete 
in all cases  the fair value of undelivered elements  such as accessories  is deferred until those items are delivered to the customer 
for certain other system sales that do involve unique customer acceptance terms or new specifications or technology with customer acceptance provisions  all revenue is generally deferred until customer acceptance 
revenue related to service contracts is recognized ratably over the duration of the contracts 
unearned maintenance and service contract revenue is included in accrued liabilities 
management determines when and how much revenue may be recognized on a particular transaction in a particular period based on its best estimates of the fair value of undelivered elements and its judgment of when the company s performance obligations have been met 
these judgments and estimates impact reported revenues 
allowances for doubtful accounts receivable 
the company sells its products and extends trade credit to a large number of customers 
these customers are dispersed across many different industries and geographies and  historically  no single customer has accounted for or more of the company s total revenues 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and generally does not require collateral from them 
although bad debt write offs have historically not been significant  allowances are established for amounts that are considered to be uncollectible 
these allowances represent management s best estimates and are based on management s judgment after considering a number of factors including third party credit reports  actual payment history  customer specific financial information  and broader market and economic trends and conditions 
in the event that actual uncollectible amounts differ from these best estimates  changes in allowances for doubtful accounts might become necessary 
inventory valuation 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost being computed on an average cost basis 
provisions are made to write down potentially excess  obsolete  or slow moving inventories to their net realizable value 
these provisions are based on management s best estimates after considering historical demand  projected future demand including current backlog  inventory purchase commitments  industry and market trends and conditions  and other factors 
in the event that actual excess  obsolete  or slow moving inventories differ from these best estimates  changes to inventory reserves might become necessary 

table of contents 
index to financial statements product warranty 
the company s products are generally subject to warranties  and liabilities are therefore established for the estimated future costs of repair or replacement through charges to cost of sales at the time the related sale is recognized 
these liabilities are adjusted based on management s best estimates of future warranty costs after considering historical and projected product failure rates and product repair costs 
in the event that actual experience differs from these best estimates  changes in the company s warranty liabilities might become necessary 
environmental liabilities 
as discussed more fully below under the heading risk factors environmental matters  under the terms of the distribution  the company and vsea are each obligated to indemnify vms for one third of certain environmental investigation  monitoring  and or remediation costs after adjusting for any insurance proceeds and tax benefits recognized or realized by vms for such costs 
the liabilities recorded by the company relating to these matters are based on management s best estimates after considering currently available information regarding the cost and timing of remediation efforts  related legal matters  insurance recoveries  and other environmental related events 
as additional information becomes available  these amounts are adjusted accordingly 
should the cost or timing of remediation efforts  legal matters  insurance recoveries  or other environmental related events including any which may be currently unidentified differ from the company s current expectations and best estimates  changes to the company s reserves for environmental matters might become necessary 
liquidity and capital resources the company generated million of cash from operating activities in fiscal year  which compares to million in fiscal year the increase in cash from operating activities resulted primarily from increased collections of accounts receivable and contract advances from customers as well as improved overall working capital utilization 
the company used million of cash for investing activities in fiscal year  which compares to million in fiscal year this decrease in cash used for investing activities was primarily due to a decrease in payments made relating to acquisitions during fiscal year the company used million of cash for financing activities in fiscal year  which compares to million generated in fiscal year the increase in cash used for financing activities in fiscal year was primarily due to an increase in the repurchase of common stock  which was partially offset by lower repayment of debt 
during fiscal year  the company established a three year unsecured revolving bank credit facility in the amount of million for working capital purposes 
no amounts were outstanding under this credit facility as of october  borrowings under this credit facility bear interest at rates of libor plus to depending on certain financial ratios of the company at the time of borrowing 
this credit facility contains certain customary covenants that limit future borrowings of the company and require the maintenance by the company of certain levels of financial performance 
the company was in compliance with all such covenants and requirements at october  during fiscal year  the company established a short term bank credit facility in japan in the amount of million yen approximately million at october  
the credit facility is available to the company s wholly owned japanese subsidiary for working capital purposes 
as of october   no amounts were outstanding under this credit facility  and million yen was available for future borrowing 
this credit facility contains certain covenants that limit future borrowings of the company from this facility  with which the company was in compliance at october  in addition to these bank credit facilities  as of october   the company and its subsidiaries had a total of million in other uncommitted and unsecured credit facilities for working capital purposes with interest rates to be established at the time of borrowing 
no borrowings were outstanding under these credit facilities as of october  all of these credit facilities contain certain conditions and events of default customary for such facilities  with which the company was in compliance at october  of the million in uncommitted and unsecured credit facilities  a total of million was limited for use by  or in favor  of certain subsidiaries 
as of october   a total of million of the 
table of contents 
index to financial statements million was being utilized in the form of bank guarantees or short term standby letters of credit 
these guarantees and letters of credit related primarily to advance payments or deposits made to the company s subsidiaries by customers for which separate liabilities were recorded in the consolidated financial statements at october  no amounts had been drawn by beneficiaries under these or any other outstanding guarantees or letters of credit as of that date 
as of october   the company had million in term loans outstanding compared to million at september  as of both october  and september   fixed interest rates on the term loans ranged from to 
the weighted average interest rate on the term loans was at october  and at september  the term loans contain certain covenants that limit future borrowings and the payment of cash dividends and require the maintenance of certain levels of working capital and operating results 
the company was in compliance with all restrictive covenants of the term loan agreements at october  the company also had other long term notes payable of million as of october  with a weighted average interest rate of and million as of september  with a weighted average interest rate of future principal payments on long term debt outstanding on october  will be million  million  million  million  million  and million during fiscal years      and thereafter  respectively 
in connection with an acquisition completed during fiscal year  the company has accrued but not yet paid a portion of the purchase price amount which has been retained to secure the seller s indemnification obligations 
this retained amount  which is due to be paid during fiscal year net of any indemnification claims  totaled approximately million at october  in addition to this retained payment  the company is  from time to time  obligated to pay additional cash purchase price amounts in the event that contingent financial or operational milestones are met by the acquired businesses 
as of october   up to a maximum of million could be payable through fiscal year under these contingent consideration arrangements 
any contingent payments made will be recorded as additional goodwill at the time they are earned 
the distribution agreement provides that the company is responsible for certain litigation to which vai was a party  and further provides that the company will indemnify vms and vsea for one third of the costs  expenses  and other liabilities relating to certain discontinued  former  and corporate operations of vai  including certain environmental liabilities see below under the heading risk factors environmental matters 
the company s liquidity is affected by many other factors  some based on the normal ongoing operations of the business and others related to the uncertainties of the industry and global economies 
although the company s cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors  management believes that cash generated from operations  together with the company s borrowing capability  will be sufficient to satisfy commitments for capital expenditures and other cash requirements for the next months 
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments the following table summarizes future principal payments on outstanding debt and minimum rentals due for certain facilities and other leased assets under long term  non cancelable operating leases as of october  fiscal year thereafter total in thousands operating leases long term debt including current portion total contractual cash obligations

index to financial statements in addition to the above  the company had cancelable commitments to purchase certain superconducting magnets intended for use with leading edge nmr systems totaling approximately million  net of deposits paid  as of october  in the event that these commitments are canceled for reasons other than the supplier s default  the company would be responsible for reimbursement of actual costs incurred by the supplier 
as of october   the company did not have any off balance sheet commercial commitments that could result in a significant cash outflow upon the occurrence of some contingent event  except for contingent payments of up to a maximum of million related to acquisitions as discussed under liquidity and capital resources above  the specific timing and amounts of which are not currently determinable 
recent accounting pronouncements in august  the fasb issued fas  accounting for asset retirement obligations 
fas addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
fas applies to all entities 
the adoption of fas in the first quarter of fiscal year did not have a significant impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued fas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes fas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and portions of accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
while fas carries forward many of the provisions of fas and apb  some of the key differences in the new standard are that goodwill is excluded from its scope  assets to be abandoned will be viewed as held for use and amortized over their remaining service period  and the standard broadens the presentation of discontinued operations 
the adoption of fas in the first quarter of fiscal year did not have a significant impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued fas  accounting for exit or disposal activities 
fas addresses the recognition  measurement  and reporting of costs associated with exit and disposal activities  including restructuring activities that are currently accounted for pursuant to the guidance set forth in emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the scope of fas includes costs related to terminating a contract that is not a capital lease  costs to consolidate facilities or relocate employees  and certain termination benefits provided to employees who are involuntarily terminated 
fas is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the adoption of fas in the second quarter of fiscal year did not have a significant impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
  and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
fin elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees  including loan guarantees  standby letters of credit  and warranty obligations 
it also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee  a company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value of the obligations it assumes under that guarantee and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements 
the provisions of fin relating to initial recognition and measurement must be applied on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements of fin  which are effective for both interim and annual periods  were adopted by the company in the first quarter of fiscal year the adoption of the initial recognition and measurement provisions of fin in the second quarter of fiscal year did not have a significant impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents 
index to financial statements in november  the fasb s emerging issues task force finalized eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting 
eitf also addresses how arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting in the arrangement 
however  it does not address when the criteria for revenue recognition are met or provide guidance on the appropriate revenue recognition convention for a given unit of accounting 
eitf is effective for all revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june   and early application is permitted 
upon adoption  entities may elect to either apply eitf prospectively or report the change in accounting as a cumulative effect adjustment 
the company adopted the initial recognition and measurement provisions of eitf prospectively in the fourth quarter of fiscal year this adoption did not have a significant impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued fas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fas fas provides additional transition guidance for those entities that elect to voluntarily adopt the accounting provisions of fas  accounting for stock based compensation 
since the company has decided to continue to apply the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock based compensation  the adoption of fas in the second quarter of fiscal year did not have an impact on its financial condition or results of operations 
however  the company began making the additional disclosures required by fas at that time 
risk factors customer demand 
demand for our products depends upon  among other factors  the level of capital expenditures by current and prospective customers  the rate of economic growth in the markets in which we compete  and the competitiveness of our products and services 
changes in any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in the case of our scientific instruments and vacuum technologies segments  we must continue to assess and predict customer needs  regulatory requirements  and evolving technologies 
we must develop new products  including enhancements to existing products  new services  and new applications  successfully commercialize  manufacture  market  and sell these products  and protect our intellectual property in these products 
if we are unsuccessful in these areas  our financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 
in the case of our electronics manufacturing segment  we must respond quickly to our customers changing requirements 
customers may change  delay  or cancel orders for many reasons  including lack of success of their products or business strategies and economic conditions in the markets they serve 
in addition  some customers  including start up companies  have limited product histories and financial resources  which make them riskier customers for us 
we must determine  based on our judgment and our customers estimates of their future requirements  what levels of business we will accept  what start up costs to incur for new customers or products  production schedules  component procurement commitments  personnel needs  and other resource requirements 
all of these decisions require predictions about the future and judgments that could be wrong 
cancellations  reductions  or delays in orders by a significant customer or group of customers  or their inability to meet financial commitments with respect to orders or shipments  could have an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
variability of operating results 
we experience some cyclical patterns in sales of our products 
generally  sales and earnings in the first quarter of our fiscal year are lower when compared to the preceding fourth fiscal quarter  primarily because there are fewer working days in our first fiscal quarter october to december and many customers defer december deliveries until the next calendar year  our second fiscal quarter 
our fourth fiscal quarter sales and earnings are often the highest in the fiscal year compared to the other three quarters  primarily because many customers spend budgeted money before their own fiscal years end 
this cyclical pattern can be influenced by other factors  including general economic conditions  acquisitions  and new product introductions 
consequently  our results of operations may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 

table of contents 
index to financial statements for most of our products  we operate on a short backlog  as short as a few days for some products and less than a fiscal quarter for most others 
we also experience significant shipments in the last month of each quarter  in part because of how our customers place orders and schedule shipments 
this can make it difficult for us to forecast our results of operations 
certain of our leading edge nmr systems  probes  and components together accounting for less than of our revenues and operating profits sell for high prices and on long lead times 
these systems and components are complex  require development of new technologies and  therefore  significant research and development resources  are often intended for evolving leading edge research applications  often have customer specific features  custom capabilities  and specific acceptance criteria  and  in the case of nmr systems  require superconducting magnets that can be difficult to manufacture 
these superconducting magnets are not manufactured by us  so our ability to ship  install  and obtain customer acceptance of our leading edge nmr systems is dependent upon the superconducting magnet supplier s timely development  delivery  and installation of magnets that perform to customer specifications 
if we are unable to meet these challenges  it could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  all of these factors can make it difficult for us to forecast shipment  installation  and acceptance of  and warranty costs on  leading edge nmr systems and probes  which in turn can make it difficult for us to forecast the timing of revenue recognition and the achieved gross profit margin on these systems and probes 
competition 
the industries in which we operate scientific instruments  vacuum technologies  and electronics manufacturing are highly competitive 
in each of these industries  we compete against many us and us companies  most with global operations 
some of our competitors have greater financial resources than we have  which may enable them to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies  take advantage of acquisition opportunities  compete on price  or devote greater resources to research and development  engineering  manufacturing  marketing  sales  or managerial activities 
others have greater name recognition and geographic and market presence or lower cost structures than we do 
in addition  weaker demand and excess capacity in our industries could cause greater price competition as our competitors seek to maintain sales volumes and market share 
additionally  in the case of electronics manufacturing  current and prospective customers continually evaluate the merits of manufacturing products internally  there is substantial excess manufacturing capacity in the industry  certain competitors manufacture or are seeking to manufacture outside the us where there can be significant cost advantages  and certain customers may be willing to move to off shore manufacturing for cost reasons  larger competitors might have greater direct buying power from suppliers  and electronics manufacturing processes are generally not subject to significant intellectual property protection 
for all of the foregoing reasons  competition could result in lower revenues due to lost sales or price reductions  lower margins  and loss of market share  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
key suppliers 
some items we purchase for the manufacture of our products  including superconducting magnets used in nmr systems  are purchased from limited or single sources of supply 
the loss of a key supplier or the inability to obtain certain key raw materials or components could cause delays or reductions in shipments of our products or increase our costs  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we have experienced and could again experience delivery delays in superconducting magnets used in nmr systems  which has caused and could again cause delays in our product shipments 
in addition  end users of our nmr systems require helium to operate those systems  shortages of helium could result in higher helium prices  and thus higher operating costs for nmr systems  which could impact demand for those systems 
our electronics manufacturing segment uses electronic components in the manufacture of its products 
these components can be more or less difficult and expensive to obtain  depending on the overall demand for these components as a result of general economic cycles or other factors 
consequently  the electronics manufacturing segment s results of operations could fluctuate over time 

table of contents 
index to financial statements business interruption 
our facilities  operations  and systems could be impacted by fire  flood  terrorism  or other natural or man made disasters 
in particular  we have significant facilities in areas prone to earthquakes and fires  such as our production facilities and headquarters in california 
due to their limited availability  broad exclusions  and prohibitive costs  we do not have insurance policies that would cover losses resulting from an earthquake 
if any of our facilities or surrounding areas were to be significantly damaged in an earthquake or fire  it could disrupt our operations  delay shipments  and cause us to incur significant repair or replacement costs  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
our employees based in certain foreign countries are subject to factory specific and or industry wide collective bargaining agreements 
of these  certain of our employees in australia are subject to a collective bargaining agreement that was renegotiated following a recent brief work stoppage 
a further work stoppage  strike  or other labor action at this or other of our facilities could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
intellectual property 
our success depends on our intellectual property 
we rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets  confidentiality agreements  and licensing arrangements to establish and protect that intellectual property  but these protections might not be available in all countries  might not be enforceable  might not fully protect our intellectual property  and might not provide meaningful competitive advantages 
moreover  we might be required to spend significant resources to police and enforce our intellectual property rights  and we might not detect infringements of those intellectual property rights 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property and enforce our intellectual property rights  our competitive position could suffer  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
other third parties might claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights  and we may be unaware of intellectual property rights that we are infringing 
any litigation regarding intellectual property of others could be costly and could divert personnel and resources from our operations 
claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to develop non infringing alternatives or enter into royalty bearing license agreements 
we might also be required to pay damages or be enjoined from developing  manufacturing  or selling infringing products 
we sometimes rely on licenses to avoid these risks  but we cannot be assured that these licenses will be available in the future or on favorable terms 
these risks could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
acquisitions 
we have acquired companies and operations  and intend to acquire companies and operations in the future  as part of our growth strategy 
acquisitions must be carefully evaluated and negotiated if they are to be successful 
once completed  acquired operations must be carefully integrated to realize expected synergies  efficiencies  and financial results 
some of the challenges in doing this include retaining key employees  managing operations in new geographic areas  retaining key customers  and managing transaction costs 
all of this must be done without diverting management and other resources from other operations and activities 
failure to successfully evaluate  negotiate  and integrate acquisitions could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
foreign operations and currency exchange rates 
a significant portion of our sales  manufacturing activities  and employees are outside of the united states 
as a result  we are subject to various risks  including the following duties  tariffs  and taxes  restrictions on currency conversions  fund transfers  or profit repatriations  import  export  and other trade restrictions  protective labor regulations and union contracts  compliance with local laws and regulations  travel and transportation difficulties  and adverse developments in political or economic environments in countries where we operate 
these risks could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
additionally  the us dollar value of our sales and operating costs varies with currency exchange rate fluctuations 
because we manufacture and sell in the us and a number of other countries  the impact that currency exchange rate fluctuations have on us is dependent on the interaction of a number of variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the relationships between various foreign currencies  the relative amount of our revenues that are denominated in us dollars or in us dollar linked currencies  customer resistance to currency driven price changes  and the suddenness and severity of changes in 
table of contents 
index to financial statements certain foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  we hedge most of our balance sheet exposures denominated in other than local currencies based upon forecasts of those exposures  in the event that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility  foreign exchange losses could result 
for all of these reasons  currency exchange fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
key personnel 
our success depends upon the efforts and abilities of key personnel  including research and development  engineering  manufacturing  finance  administrative  marketing  sales  and management personnel 
the availability of qualified personnel can vary significantly based on factors such as the strength of the general economy 
however  even in weak economic periods  there is still intense competition for personnel with certain expertise in the geographic areas where we compete for personnel 
in addition  certain employees have significant institutional and proprietary technical knowledge  which could be difficult to quickly replace 
failure to attract and retain qualified personnel  who generally do not have employment agreements or post employment non competition agreements  could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
environmental matters 
our operations are subject to various foreign  federal  state  and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 
these regulations increase the costs and potential liabilities of our operations 
however  we do not currently anticipate that our compliance with these regulations will have a material effect on our capital expenditures  earnings  or competitive position 
as is described above  we and vsea are each obligated pursuant to the terms of the distribution to indemnify vms for one third of certain costs after adjusting for any insurance proceeds and tax benefits recognized or realized by vms for such costs relating to environmental matters 
in that regard  vms has been named by the us environmental protection agency or third parties as a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of  as amended  at nine sites where vai is alleged to have shipped manufacturing waste for recycling  treatment  or disposal 
in addition  vms is overseeing and  as applicable  reimbursing third parties for environmental investigation  monitoring  and or remediation activities under the direction of  or in consultation with  foreign  federal  state  and or local agencies at certain current vms or former vai facilities 
we and vsea are each obligated to indemnify vms for one third of these environmental investigation  monitoring  and or remediation costs after adjusting for any insurance proceeds and taxes 
for certain of these sites and facilities  various uncertainties make it difficult to assess the likelihood and scope of further environmental related activities or to estimate the future costs of such activities if undertaken 
as of october   it was nonetheless estimated that our share of the future exposure for environmental related costs for these sites and facilities ranged in the aggregate from million to million without discounting to present value 
the time frame over which these costs are expected to be incurred varies with each site and facility  ranging up to approximately years as of october  no amount in the foregoing range of estimated future costs is believed to be more probable of being incurred than any other amount in such range  and we therefore had an accrual of million as of october  as to certain sites and facilities  sufficient knowledge has been gained to be able to better estimate the scope and certain costs of future environmental related activities 
as of october   it was estimated that our share of the future exposure for these environmental related costs for these sites and facilities ranged in the aggregate from million to million without discounting to present value 
the time frame over which these costs are expected to be incurred varies with each site and facility  ranging up to approximately years as of october  as to each of these sites and facilities  it was determined that a particular amount within the range of certain estimated costs was a better estimate of the future environmental related cost than any other amount within the range  and that the amount and timing of these future costs were reliably determinable 
together  these amounts totaled million at october  we therefore had an accrual of million as of october   which represents the best estimate of our share of these future environmental related costs discounted at  net of inflation 
this accrual is in addition to the million described in the preceding paragraph

index to financial statements at october   our reserve for environmental related costs  based upon future environmental related costs estimated by us as of that date  was calculated as follows recurring costs non recurring costs total anticipated future costs in millions fiscal year thereafter total costs less imputed interest reserve amount less current portion long term included in other liabilities the foregoing amounts are only estimates of anticipated future environmental related costs  and the amounts actually spent in the years indicated may be greater or less than such estimates 
the aggregate range of cost estimates reflects various uncertainties inherent in many environmental investigation  monitoring  and remediation activities and the large number of sites where such investigation  monitoring  and remediation activities are being undertaken 
an insurance company has agreed to pay a portion of certain of vai s now vms future environmental related costs for which we have an indemnity obligation  and we therefore have a short term receivable of million in accounts receivable and a million receivable in other assets as of october  for our share of such recovery 
we have not reduced any environmental related liability in anticipation of recoveries from third parties 
management believes that our reserves for the foregoing and other environmental related matters are adequate  but as the scope of our obligation becomes more clearly defined  these reserves may be modified  and related charges against or credits to earnings may be made 
although any ultimate liability arising from environmental related matters could result in significant expenditures that  if aggregated and assumed to occur within a single fiscal year  would be material to our financial statements  the likelihood of such occurrence is considered remote 
based on information currently available and our best assessment of the ultimate amount and timing of environmental related events  management believes that the costs of environmental related matters are not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
governmental regulations 
our businesses are subject to many governmental regulations in the us and other countries  including with respect to protection of the environment  employee health and safety  labor matters  product safety  medical devices  import  export  competition  and sales to governmental entities 
these regulations are complex and change frequently 
we incur significant costs to comply with governmental regulations  and failure to comply could result in suspension of or restrictions on our operations  product recalls  fines  and other civil and criminal penalties  private party litigation  and damage to our reputation  which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk the company typically hedges its foreign currency exposures associated with certain assets and liabilities denominated in non functional currencies and  from time to time  hedges certain forecasted foreign currency cash flows 
the success of the company s hedging activities depends on its ability to forecast balance sheet exposures and transaction activity in various foreign currencies 
to the extent that these forecasts are overstated or understated during periods of currency volatility  the company could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
however  the company believes that in most cases gains or losses would be substantially offset by losses or gains from the related foreign exchange forward contracts 
the company therefore believes that the direct effect of an immediate change in the exchange rate between the us dollar and all other currencies is not reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company s foreign exchange forward contracts generally range from one to months in original maturity 
at october   there were no outstanding forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted sale transactions 
during the fiscal year ended october   a loss of million from cash flow hedge ineffectiveness was recognized and included in general and administrative expenses 
a summary of all forward exchange contracts that were outstanding as of october  follows notional value sold notional value purchased in thousands euro australian dollar british pound swedish krona japanese yen canadian dollar total interest rate risk the company has no material exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates 
the company invests any excess cash primarily in short term us treasury securities and money market funds  and changes in interest rates would not be material to the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company primarily enters into debt obligations to support general corporate purposes  including working capital requirements  capital expenditures  and acquisitions 
at october   the company s debt obligations had fixed interest rates 
based upon rates currently available to the company for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities  the carrying amounts of long term debt and notes payable approximate their estimated fair values 
although payments under certain of the company s operating leases for its facilities are tied to market indices  the company is not exposed to material interest rate risk associated with its operating leases
