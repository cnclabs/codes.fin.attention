in accordance with the merger agreement  the company issued  after giving effect to a for reverse stock split shares of its common stock and  shares of a newly issued non voting preferred stock in exchange for all the outstanding voting stock of rotonics 
the preferred stock was completely redeemed prior to the end of fiscal  and the company s articles of incorporation were subsequently amended to eliminate the authorization of series a preferred stock

effective january   the company acquired plastech holdings  inc plastech  and its wholly owned subsidiary  plastech international  inc  for  in cash 
plastech was headquartered in warminster  pennsylvania  with an additional operation in gainesville  texas 
in july  plastech was merged with the company and now operates as a division of the company using the trade name rmi t 
effective april   the company purchased certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of custom rotational molding  inc crm for  shares of the company s common stock 
the company assumed crm s operations in arleta  california 
in september  the company purchased a larger manufacturing facility in bensenville  illinois and subsequently relocated its itasca  illinois operations into this new facility 
in december  the company discontinued its operations at its deerfield  wisconsin location and combined these operations into its newly purchased bensenville  illinois operation 
the wisconsin facility is currently being leased to two tenants on a month to month term basis at  per month 
in february  the company purchased a acre facility consisting of  square feet of manufacturing and office building space in commerce city  colorado 
the company has since expended significant resources to refurbish the facility to house its colorado operations 
the facility is also located within an enterprise zone  which continues to provide additional benefits 
the company leases a portion of this facility s excess office and yard space on a long term basis at  per month 
effective april   the company merged with rotocast international  inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries rotocast  with the company being the surviving entity 
in accordance with the merger agreement  the company issued  shares of its common stock and a  note payable secured by a stand by letter of credit  in exchange for all the outstanding voting stock of rotocast 
in january  the company repurchased these shares for million 
upon consummation of the repurchase  the shares were retired 
rotocast had operations in miami  florida  knoxville  tennessee  brownwood  texas  las vegas  nevada  and bossier city  louisiana 
these operations currently conduct business as divisions of the company using the trade names nutron  rotocast of tennessee  rmi b and rmi nevada 
prior to the merger  the operations in bossier city  louisiana were substantially discontinued 
rotocast was a privately held florida corporation  owned by gsc industries  inc gsc 
the company leases the remaining rotocast facilities from gsc  and other affiliated parties  under long term lease arrangements 
a portion of the nutron office building is being sub leased on a long term basis at  per month 
in conjunction with the rotocast merger  the company initiated the consolidation of its warminster  pennsylvania and arleta  california facilities into its remaining operations 
the consolidation of these facilities was completed in fiscal and enhanced the operations of the company s remaining facilities  reduced its overall manufacturing overhead costs  and allowed the company to take greater advantage of its marketing and distribution channels 
also  in fiscal  the company consolidated its miami operations into the remaining operating facilities 
the corporate office of the company is located at the same site as the rmi g gardena  california facility 
description of business the company currently has ten manufacturing locations and was again listed by a plastics industry periodical as one of the top ten rotational molders in north america 
these operating divisions manufacture a variety of plastic products for commercial  agricultural  pharmaceutical  governmental  building  medical waste  refuse  retail  recreation  marine  healthcare and residential use  as well as a vast number of custom plastic products for a variety of industries  utilizing the rotonically molding process and  on a smaller scale  injection molding and dip molding processes 
in april  the injection molding process was added to the company s manufacturing operations as part of the rotocast merger 
utilizing this process  the company markets a variety of parts for commercial  promotional  and residential uses  under the trade names nutron and amp 
rotonically molding is a process for molding plastic resin by rotating a mold in a heated environment  while the plastic resin powder placed inside the mold melts and evenly coats the inner wall of the mold 
the injection molding process varies in that the plastic resin is first heated to a molten state and then injected under pressure into a mold 
the rotonically molding process has been used for many years and continues to be recognized as a growth industry in recent years  as a result of numerous ongoing business consolidations and the development of new resins 
these new resins allow rotonically molded items to compete with more traditional materials such as carbon  fiberglass  and stainless steel  especially in the fabrication of large  lightweight  one piece molded items  such as storage tanks and polysteel light poles 
rotonically molding is a particularly advantageous process for users of molded plastic products who may want to test different prototypes  or who do not require sufficient numbers of such products to justify a more expensive manufacturing process 
the company s products include various types of storage tanks  bin lids  refuse containers for automated removal  medical waste containers  agricultural livestock products  kayaks  outdoor polysteel lamp posts  furniture  planters  and other rotonically molded items 
the company purchases resin from five major suppliers in the us and canada 
there are fourteen additional suppliers of lesser significance 
since the majority of the resin used in the manufacturing process is a polyethylene derived from natural gas  resin price is not directly related to the price for petrochemicals  and until recent years  has not generally been subject to volatile fluctuations that are often experienced by the petroleum industry 
the company also incorporates the use of recycled plastic materials  blended with virgin materials in the manufacturing of products  whenever appropriate 
the company holds several patents on storage containers used for pharmaceutical  commercial and residential applications that expire through the year although the company has been able to capture its share of these niche markets and expects to see continued growth  no one patent or groups of patents is considered material to the business as a whole 
competition for the company s products is governed by geography and region  since large capacity tanks and bulky hollow products are expensive to ship long distances and  as such  any prospective competitor is constrained by shipping costs 
there are numerous single location  as well as a growing trend to structure multi location  rotonically molding businesses throughout the united states 
however  each of these businesses still competes in a geographic region  which is determined by customer demand within that region  a constraint inherent to the industry 
due to its nationwide presence  the company has substantially alleviated this constraint 
the company s sales are usually not subject to large seasonal fluctuations as the business typically operates on significant backlogs with a diverse product mix 
peak season is usually experienced in the period from april through june 
historically  the quarter from january through march is the slowest production period of the year 
the company s backlog was  and  as of june  and  respectively 
all of the backlog orders as of june  are expected to be filled during fiscal the company s products are marketed through the in house sales and engineering staff  various distributors and outside commission based sales representatives 
the company continues to build a strong  broad and diverse customer base  which covers a multitude of industries 
since fiscal  no sales to any one single customer represented a material part of the company s business 
research and development expenditures for the company were insignificant for the last three fiscal years 
regulation the company believes it is in compliance with all applicable federal  state and local laws relating to the protection of the environment  and does not anticipate any such laws will have material effect on its financial position  capital expenditures  or competitive position 
employees as of june   the company employed a total of individuals 
the company maintains  for its respective employees who are eligible  a medical insurance plan some of which is contributory  a group life insurance plan  an annual bonus plan and a semi annual attendance bonus plan

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction to the extent that this k annual report discusses matters which are not historical  including statements regarding future financial results  information  or expectation about products or markets  or otherwise makes statements about future events  such statements are forward looking and are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the statements made 
these include  among others  fluctuations in costs of raw materials and other expenses  costs associated with plant closures  downturns in the markets served by the company  the costs associated with new product introductions  as well as other factors described under the heading item  business  item  legal proceedings  under this item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and footnote to financial statements 
when used in this report  the words expects  anticipates  intends  plans  believes  seeks  estimates and similar expressions are generally intended to identify forward looking statements 
you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which reflect our opinion only as of the date of the annual report 
we undertake no obligation to publicly release any revisions to the forward looking statements after the date of this document 
you should carefully review the risk factors described in other documents we file from time to time with the securities and exchange commission  including the quarterly reports on form q to be filed by us in fiscal operations net sales fell to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal fiscal sales volumes continue to mirror our nation s lackluster economy 
our industrial product group reflected the most resilience during these tough conditions  reporting a modest increase in sales 
of the hardest hit sectors  our contract manufacturing group was down in fiscal however  fiscal was also a strong period for contract tooling projects that are expected to help boost future contract manufacturing sales 
we also continue to receive positive feedback that the us economy is slowly moving forward 
if this trend sustains itself  we anticipate it will further support positive sales volume growth for our product lines 
we are also in the final stages of placing our new roto molding machine into service  which will improve our competitive edge in the marketplace 
net sales dropped to  in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal even though our diverse product offerings helped minimize sales volume deterioration  the country s general economic conditions continued to weigh heavily on the manufacturing sector 
our marine and consumer product groups reported the largest downturn with decreases of and  respectively  compared to fiscal volumes 
despite the overall drop in sales  industrial products posted a respectable increase over fiscal sales volumes 
industrial products continue to be a growth sector for us as we continue to broaden our product offerings and target specific niche markets 
cost of goods sold was  or of net sales  in fiscal compared to  or and  or of net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
we were pleased that targeted gross margin objectives were sustained as we continued to battle rising raw material  insurance and utility costs 
workers compensation costs continue to escalate in many areas in which we operate reflecting a rise over prior years costs 
to date  we have contained most of these costs through systematic product price increases  sustaining workforce reductions and ongoing efficiency and cost containment efforts 
fiscal was also pressured by a lackluster economy 
to maintain acceptable margins  we again improved our manufacturing efficiencies and reduced our workforce by during the year 
this  coupled with favorable resin prices and a  reduction in natural gas costs that had previously spiked in fiscal  helped counter the increase in workers compensation costs in fiscal as depicted  the cost of plastic resin  utility costs and labor related costs represent the major portion of the company s manufacturing costs 
we anticipate that we will continually be challenged to mitigate future cost increases related to these expenses  which in turn could hamper the company s goal to maintain future gross margin objectives 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were  or of net sales  in fiscal compared to  or of net sales  in fiscal overall sg a costs have decreased  which is primarily attributed to our cost containment efforts 
these efforts were reflected in reduced marketing costs of  travel costs of  and wage benefit costs of  additional cost savings were also reflected in commission royalty expenses of  due to royalty agreements completed last fiscal year and a dip in commission based product sales  and finally  a reduction in bad debt expense of  these costs savings were partially offset by a  one time administrative contractual charge during fiscal sg a expenses were  or of net sales  in fiscal compared to  or of net sales  in fiscal the comparative percentage increase is attributed to the lower sales volumes 
however  overall sg a costs decreased by  which is primarily related to the elimination of goodwill amortization in the amount of  net of planned increases in marketing  wage and wage related costs of approximately  and an increase in bad debt expense of  income from operations was  or of net sales  in fiscal compared to  or and  or of net sales in fiscal and  respectively 
the reduction in operating income in fiscal is attributed to the reduction in sales volumes coupled with increase in cost of goods sold attributed to unmitigated increases in workers compensation insurance  utilities and raw material costs 
the increase in fiscal operating income was attributed to the elimination of goodwill amortization  due to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets as well as lower raw material and utility costs 
total interest expense decreased  to  in fiscal  compared to  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease is due to the significant reduction in our debt structure  which amounted to  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
the overall debt reduction coupled with the low interest rate environment during the last two years and the renegotiation of our bank interest rate swap agreement contributed to further reductions in interest costs in fiscal and will continue to have a positive effect on reducing future interest costs 
income taxes were   and  in fiscal years  and  respectively 
prior to fiscal  a significant portion of our tax provision was the deferred tax component  which amounted to  and  in fiscal years and  respectively 
during fiscal and  these amounts primarily related to the utilization of our federal and state net operating loss nol carryforwards and federal alternative minimum tax amt credit carryforward  and thus did not diminish cash flows 
in fiscal  we fully utilized our remaining federal nol carryforward  and in fiscal we fully utilized the  federal amt credit carryforward 
following the utilization of these carryforwards  we have incurred an increase in our current federal taxes 
current federal taxes amounted to  in fiscal compared to  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
as such  our cash flow requirements have significantly increased for the payment of current federal taxes 
net income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for goodwill decreased  to  or 
per common share  for fiscal compared to  or 
per common share  in fiscal although we believe that future market conditions are slowly improving  fiscal was hampered by a sluggish economy  especially in the fourth quarter  which contributed to the drop in sales volumes 
while our cost containment efforts  as reflected in the  reduction in sg a costs  along with lower interest costs  helped to preserve income levels  we still were unable to fully compensate for rising raw material  insurance and utility costs 
even though these trends will continue to challenge future periods  we remain optimistic that our strong financial condition and business strategies will help us to continue to respond to current market conditions and allow us to take advantage of growth opportunities as they become available 
net income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for goodwill increased  to  or per common share  for fiscal compared to net income of  or per common share  in fiscal even though market conditions were challenging in fiscal  we were pleased that we were able to minimize the deterioration of sales volumes in comparison to the prior year results 
these efforts  coupled with improved efficiencies  cost containment efforts  workforce reductions and the reductions relating to interest expense and goodwill previously mentioned  helped to successfully minimize the impact of these adverse market conditions  and ultimately resulted in the improvement in net income for fiscal before the effect of the accounting change 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for goodwill we recorded an adjustment effective july  to reflect the impact of adopting sfas no  amounting to a reduction of intangible assets of  this amount is reflected in net loss for the fiscal year ended june  as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for goodwill 
the adjustment represents a write down of our net goodwill based on a review of the goodwill for impairment 
under the assessment guidelines of sfas no 
and the sec s guidance that our quoted market price is the most efficient mechanism for estimating fair value  it was determined the fair value of our reporting unit was less than its carrying value 
although the assumptions used to estimate fair value may not be indicative of future results  our goodwill has been reduced to zero and will not require future impairment analysis 
liquidity and capital resources working capital decreased  to  at june  compared to  at june  the reduction is related to a decrease in accounts receivable  which is in line with current sales volumes  plus a decrease in our current portion of long term debt due to the payoff of our real estate note and a decrease in income taxes payable net of an increase in accounts payable at year end that included amounts due for the new roto molding machine and additional resin shipments to take advantage of favorable pricing 
cash flows from operations decreased  to  for fiscal  compared to  for the same period last year 
this reduction is primarily related to the  drop in income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for goodwill between the two periods 
earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda were  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal although ebidta is not a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  gaap  it is a relevant internal measurement of our operations and cash flows 
as such  in spite of the on going challenges faced in fiscal  we continue to generate sufficient cash flows from operations enabling us to meet our working capital needs  service and reduce our debt  in fiscal  pay the 
per share common stock dividend declared in june and continue the common stock buyback program 
we expended  for property  plant and equipment pp e in fiscal  compared to  in fiscal the increase of  in comparison to the amount expended in fiscal  is due to the purchase of new technology based molding equipment that will be completed in fiscal we currently anticipate capital expenditures to total approximately million in fiscal net borrowings under the line of credit increased  to  between june  and june  the increase is due to the timing of funding capital expenditure projects and the payment of federal income taxes in june due to the timing of these types of payments  we can anticipate the line of credit to reflect temporary fluctuations throughout the year 
effective october   the bank extended the maturity date on the line of credit to october  in addition  management did not advance on the  term loan commitment and instead requested the bank to issue a new term loan commitment in the same amount that will expire on october  effective august   we also amended our interest rate swap agreement with the bank  by reducing the notional amount down to million  reducing the fixed libor rate and extending the maturity date to august  the following is a summary of the company s contractual commitments associated with its debt and lease obligations as of june  for the year ended june  thereafter total principal payments term debt operating leases total commitments during fiscal  we reinstated our common stock buyback program 
in fiscal  we acquired  shares of common stock at a total cost of  we plan to continue to actively acquire our common shares 
as of june   we had approximately  shares of common stock outstanding 
on june  the board declared a dividend of 
per share of common stock payable on july  to stockholders of record on july  this marks the seventh payment of dividends since on our common stock 
the board is committed to annually review a dividend program for our common stock 
cash flows from operations in conjunction with our revolving line of credit are expected to meet our needs for working capital  capital expenditures  common stock repurchases and repayment of long term debt for the foreseeable future

accounting for impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  as well as accounting principle board opinion no 
reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of business  and extraordinary  unusual  and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
sfas no 
not only retains the requirements of sfas no 
to recognize an impairment loss if the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows  but also establishes a single accounting method for assets to be disposed of and broadens the presentation of discounted operations to include more disposal transactions 
sfas no 
was effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of this pronouncement did not have a significant impact on the company s financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no

this pronouncement was effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december   and requires these costs to be recognized when the liability is incurred and not at project initiation 
this statement did not have a material impact on the company s financial statements

sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements in sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  for annual periods ending after december  and for interim periods beginning after december  effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december   sfas no 
also provides three alternative transition methods for companies that choose to adopt the fair value measurement provisions of sfas no

had compensation cost for the plan been determined in accordance with the fair value method as set forth in sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
 the company s net income and income per common share data would not have been significantly different 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
is intended to result in more consistent reporting of contracts as either freestanding derivative instruments subject to sfas no 
in its entirety  or as hybrid instruments with debt host contracts and embedded derivative features 
in addition  sfas no 
clarifies the definition of a derivative by providing guidance on the meaning of initial net investments related to derivatives 
this statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  the company does not believe the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations the company has no off balance sheet arrangements or significant guarantees to third parties not fully recorded in our balance sheets or fully disclosed in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s significant contractual obligations include our debt agreements 
certain financial and operating restrictions under these agreements are fully disclosed in notes and of the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies we make various estimates when applying accounting policies in accordance with gaap that affect our consolidated financial statements 
due to the nature of our business  these estimates generally are not considered highly uncertain at the time of estimation and therefore are not expected to result in a period to period change that would materially affect our results of operations or financial condition 
we do apply key accounting principles as required by gaap 
these key accounting policies govern allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation and income taxes 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make judgments as to its ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful 
provisions are based on a percentage of net sales and a specific review of all significant outstanding receivable balances 
percentages applied may vary based on analysis of historical collection experience or current economic trends 
if the data we use to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and the results of operations could be affected 
inventory valuation finished goods inventory is valued at cost and management uses historical gross margin trends and other estimates to continually update labor and overhead allocations 
the gross margin percentage reflects our estimate of the cost of  among other things  material  labor and overhead expenditures during the production process 
such cost are capitalized to inventory as products are manufactured 
although it is believed that the estimates are reasonable  it is possible that the actual labor and overhead costs will differ over time from the estimated amounts 
such differences could have a material impact on the company s results of operations and financial position 
income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  income taxes are recorded based on the current amounts payable or refundable  as well as the consequences of events that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences in how those events are treated for tax purposes 
we base our estimates of deferred tax assets and liabilities on current tax laws and rates and in certain cases expectations about future outcomes 
our accounting for deferred tax consequences represents management s best estimate of future events that can be appropriately reflected in accounting estimates 
although management believes that its estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in tour historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
in particular  we recorded a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized 
while management has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  there is no assurance that the valuation allowance would not need to be increased to cover additional deferred tax assets that may not be realized 
any increase in the valuation allowance could have a material adverse impact on our income tax provision and net income for the period in which such determination is made 
factors that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock we operate in a rapidly changing economic environment that presents numerous risks 
many of these risks are beyond our control and are driven by factors that we cannot predict 
the following discussion highlights some of these risks 
economic  political and market conditions can adversely affect our revenue growth 
our revenue growth and profitability depends on the overall demand for plastic products for commercial  recreational and residential uses 
because our sales are primarily to corporate and government customers  our business depends on general economic and business conditions 
the general weakening of the global economy  the weakening of business conditions in the manufacturing industry  and governmental budgetary constraints have resulted in a decreased demand for our products 
if demand for our products continues to be weak  our revenue growth rates will be adversely affected 
in addition  our country s war on terrorism  as well as federal and state budgetary concerns  have contributed to economic  political and other uncertainties that could adversely affect our revenue growth and results of operations 
if economic and market conditions do not improve as anticipated  our business will continue to be adversely affected 
management has no comparative advantage in forecasting macroeconomic trends and developments relating to general business conditions 
our management is  however  required to make such forecasts in order to develop budgets  plan research and development strategies and perform a wide variety of general management functions 
to the extent that our forecasts are in error  because we are either overly optimistic or overly pessimistic about the performance of an economy or of a sector  our performance can suffer because of a failure properly to match corporate strategy with economic conditions 
if we do not successfully manage our operating margins  our business can be negatively impacted 
our future operating results will depend on our ability to forecast revenues accurately and control expenses 
while we can control certain internal factors  our future operating results can be adversely impacted by external factors  such as a slowing in demand for certain of our products 
if there is an unexpected decline in revenues  which is not offset by a decrease in expenses  our business and operating results will be adversely affected 
we may be required to change our business practices if there are changes in accounting regulations and related interpretations and policies 
policies  guidelines and interpretations related to revenue recognition  income taxes  facilities consolidation  accounting for acquisitions  allowances for doubtful accounts and other financial reporting matters require difficult judgments as to complex matters that are often subject to multiple sources of authoritative guidance 
some of these matters are also among topics currently under re examination by accounting standards groups and regulators 
these standard groups and regulators could promulgate interpretations and guidance that could result in material and potentially adverse  changes to our accounting policies 
business disruptions could affect our future operating results 
our operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake  fire or other catastrophic event  such as terrorist attacks upon the united states 
our corporate headquarters  a significant portion of our research and development activities and certain other critical business operations are located in california  near major earthquake faults 
a catastrophic event that results in the destruction of any of our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result our future operating results could be adversely affected 
in  california experienced ongoing power shortages  which resulted in rolling blackouts 
these blackouts  blackouts in other regions or procedures implemented to avert blackouts could cause disruptions to our operations and the operations of our customers 
such disruptions  particularly at the end of a quarter  could adversely affect quarterly revenues and net income 
our stock price could remain volatile and your investment could lose value 
our stock price has fluctuated widely in the past and could continue to do so in the future 
your investment in our stock could lose value 
some of the factors that could significantly affect the market price of our stock include quarterly variations in our results of operations or those of our competitors  changes in our or our competitors prices  changes in our revenue and revenue growth rates as a whole or for specific geographic areas  business units  products or product categories  announcements of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors  changes in management  changes in our accounting policies  changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by financial analysts  speculation in the press or analyst community  changes in economic and market conditions either generally or specifically to particular industries  changes in interest rates  and changes in investors beliefs as to the appropriate price earnings ratios for us and our competitors 
a significant drop in our stock price could expose us to the risk of securities class action lawsuits 
defending against such lawsuits could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources 
furthermore  any settlement or adverse determination of these lawsuits could adversely affect us 
item a
