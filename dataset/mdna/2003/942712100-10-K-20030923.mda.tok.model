however  the revenues and operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations only reflect the results of operations of watson wyatt company holdings 
our share of the results of our affiliates  recorded using the equity method of accounting  is reflected in the income from affiliates line 
our affiliates are watson wyatt llp  watson wyatt holdings europe limited and professional consultants insurance company  inc pcic  our captive insurance company 
we derive substantially all of our revenue from fees for consulting services  which generally are billed at standard hourly rates or on a fixed fee basis 
clients are typically invoiced on a monthly basis with revenue recognized as services are performed 
for the most recent three fiscal years  revenue from us consulting operations has comprised approximately percent of consolidated revenue 
no single client accounted for more than percent of our consolidated revenue for any of the most recent three fiscal years 
in delivering consulting services  our principal direct expenses relate to compensation of personnel 
salaries and employee benefits are comprised of wages paid to associates  related taxes  benefit expenses such as pension  medical and insurance costs and fiscal year end incentive bonuses 
professional and subcontracted services represent fees paid to external service providers for accounting  employment  marketing and other services 
for the most recent three fiscal years  approximately percent of these professional and subcontracted services were directly incurred on behalf of our clients and were reimbursed by them  with such reimbursements being included in revenue 
occupancy  communications and other expenses represent expenses for rent  utilities  supplies and telephone to operate office locations as well as non client reimbursed travel by associates  publications and professional development 
general and administrative expenses include the operational costs and professional fees paid by corporate management  general counsel  marketing  human resources  finance  research and technology support 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
our estimates  judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience 
because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
we have reviewed the accounting estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements and have determined that the following accounting policies are critical to the understanding of the use of estimates in the company s financial statements revenue recognition revenues include fees primarily generated from consulting services provided in the areas of employee benefits  human capital strategies and related technology solutions 
we recognize revenue from these consulting engagements either on a time and materials basis or on a fixed fee basis  depending on the terms and conditions defined at the inception of an engagement with a client 
revenue is recognized on time and materials engagements to the extent of billable rates times hours delivered plus expenses incurred 
for fixed fee engagements  we periodically review ongoing engagements in order to assess the accuracy of our estimates to complete 
revenue recognition is affected by a number of factors including a change in the estimated amount of effort required to complete the project  changes in scope  the staffing on the engagement and or the level of client participation 
this review requires us to make judgments and estimates regarding the overall profitability and stage of project completion which  in turn  affects how we recognize revenue 
to the extent that our estimates change for a particular engagement  we record the cumulative effect of the change in the period in which it becomes known 
the company recognizes a loss on an engagement when estimated revenue to be received for that engagement is less than total estimated direct and indirect costs associated with the engagement 
losses are recognized in the period in which the loss becomes probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
the company has developed various software programs and technologies that are provided to clients in connection with consulting services 
we recognize revenue for such services as time is incurred because the services are considered essential to the functionality of the software 
revenues recognized in excess of billings are recorded as unbilled accounts receivable 
cash collections in excess of revenues recognized are recorded as deferred revenues until the revenue recognition criteria are met 
client reimbursable expenses  including those relating to travel  other out of pocket expenses  and any third party costs  are included in revenues  and an equivalent amount of reimbursable expenses are included in professional and subcontracted services as a cost of revenues 
valuation of billed and unbilled receivables from clients we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to reflect estimated losses resulting from our clients failure to pay for our services after the services have been rendered  including allowances when customer disputes may exist 
the related provision is recorded as a reduction to revenue 
our allowance policy is based on the aging of our billed and unbilled client receivables and has been developed based on our write off history 
facts and circumstances may change that would require us to alter our estimates of the collectibility of specific billed and unbilled client receivables 
discretionary compensation the company s compensation program includes a discretionary component in the form of an annual bonus that is determined by management and paid once per fiscal year in the form of cash and or deferred stock units after the company s annual operating results are finalized 
quarterly  estimated annual pre bonus profitability is reviewed by the company and the discretionary annual bonus amount is then estimated by management 
after determining the estimated annual bonus amount  the bonus is then allocated to remaining quarterly reporting periods as a constant percentage of estimated pre bonus income from operations 
in those quarters where the estimated annual bonus level changes  the remaining estimated annual bonus is accrued over the remaining quarters as a constant percentage of estimated future pre bonus income from operations 
annual bonus levels may vary from current expectations as a result of changes in the company s forecast of pre bonus profitability and competitive employment market conditions 
income taxes determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities and the related valuation allowance involves judgment 
as a global company with offices in countries  we are required to calculate and provide for estimated income tax liabilities for each of the tax jurisdictions where we operate 
this process involves estimating current tax obligations and exposures in each jurisdiction as well as making judgments regarding the future recoverability of deferred tax assets 
tax costs can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve 
changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre tax income  revisions to tax positions taken as a result of further analysis and consultation  changes in tax laws and changes resulting from tax audits can all affect the overall effective income tax rate  which  in turn  impacts the overall level of income tax expense and net income 
pension assumptions we sponsor both qualified and non qualified  non contributory defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all of our associates 
under our principal plans united states  canada  hong kong and the united kingdom  benefits are based on our associates years of service and compensation during the three highest paid consecutive years of service 
determination of our obligations and annual expense under the plans are based on a number of assumptions that  given the longevity of the plans  are long term in their focus 
a change in one or a combination of these assumptions could have a material impact on our pension benefit obligation and related expense 
for this reason  management employs a long term view so that assumptions do not change frequently in response to short term volatility in the economy 
any difference between actual and assumed results is amortized into our pension expense over the average remaining service period of participating employees 
we consider several factors prior to the start of each fiscal year when determining the appropriate annual assumptions  including economic forecasts  historical trends  portfolio composition and peer comparisons 
the following assumptions were used at the end of the past three fiscal years in the valuation of our us plan  which comprises the majority of the principal defined benefit pension plans year ended june discount rate expected long term rate of return on assets rate of increase in compensation levels the percent discount rate assumption used at the end of fiscal year represents a basis point reduction from the percent discount rate used at the end of fiscal years and the company s discount rate assumption was determined by matching future pension benefit payments with expected future aa bond yields for the same periods 
the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption was lowered to percent at the end of fiscal year from percent at the end of fiscal years and selection of the percent return assumption was supported by an analysis performed by the company of the weighted average yield expected to be achieved with the anticipated makeup of investments 
the investment makeup is heavily weighted towards equities 
the investment market performance over the last two years has decreased the value of the assets held in the pension plans and the decline in interest rates has increased our accumulated benefit obligation  resulting in the accumulated benefit obligation becoming greater than the value of the plan assets for the us and us pension plans 
as a result  the company was required to record an additional minimum pension liability for those plans in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
employers accounting for pensions fas 
this resulted in an increase in the pension liability of million  an increase in intangible assets of million  a non cash charge to stockholders equity of million reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss and an increase in deferred tax assets of million 
a market recovery in future periods  and or an increase in long term interest rates  could reverse a portion or all of this charge 
our canadian and hong kong pension plan assets are greater than their associated accumulated benefit obligation as of june   and thus do not require the recording of additional minimum pension liabilities 
incurred but not reported claims the company uses actuarial assumptions to estimate and record a liability for incurred but not reported ibnr professional liability claims and engaged an external actuarial firm to assist in the calculation of these estimates 
our estimated ibnr liability is based on long term trends and averages  and considers a number of factors  including changes in claim reporting patterns  claim settlement patterns  judicial decisions  and legislation and economic decisions  but excludes the effect of claims data for large cases due to the insufficiency of actual experience with such cases 
management does not currently expect significant fluctuations in the ibnr liability  based on the company s historical claims experience 
however  our estimated ibnr liability will fluctuate if claims experience changes over time

stock loans 
additionally  the company guarantees a credit facility that provided loans to associates for stock purchased under our former stock purchase program

the maximum available borrowings and aggregate outstanding balances under this facility were million at june   and million at june  a total of  and  watson wyatt company holdings shares were pledged by stockholders to collateralize these loans at june  and  respectively 
credit agreement the company has entered into a million revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks 
interest rates associated with this facility vary with libor and or the prime rate  and are based on our leverage ratio  as defined by the credit agreement 
we are charged a quarterly commitment fee  currently percent of the facility  that varies with our financial leverage and is calculated on the unused portion of the credit facility 
no amounts were outstanding under the company s revolving credit facility as of june   or june  credit under the facility is available upon demand  although the credit facility requires us to observe certain covenants including requirements for minimum net worth  which act to restrict dividends and other financial and restrictive covenants and is collateralized with a pledge of stock of material subsidiaries 
the lenders supporting the credit facility agreed to an amendment of the minimum net worth covenant effective june   such that we would avoid a default that would have resulted from recording an additional minimum pension liability in the fourth quarter of fiscal year as a result  we were in compliance with all covenants under the credit facility as of june  a portion of the revolving facility is used to support required letters of credit issued under the credit line 
as a result  million of the facility is currently unavailable for operating needs 
we are also charged a fee for outstanding letters of credit that also fluctuates based on our leverage ratio 
the credit facility is scheduled to expire on june  risk management as a part of our overall risk management program  we carry customary commercial insurance policies  including commercial general liability  employment practices liability  as well as claims made professional liability insurance with a self insured retention of million per claim  which provides coverage for professional liability claims including the cost of defending such claims 
our primary insurance coverage beyond this retention is written by an affiliated captive insurance company owned by us and two other professional services firms 
the first million of coverage has a premium structure which provides that the captive insurance company will recover from the firm defending the claim approximately percent of any loss up to million 
the company records an accrual for this liability 
this recovery occurs through insurance premium payments in subsequent years 
the remaining percent of any loss up to million is a risk borne by the captive insurance company  which carries reinsurance in the commercial markets for most losses above million 
the company provides for the self insured retention and for the prospective premium increases where specific estimated losses for known claims in excess of million are considered probable and reasonably estimable 
although the company maintains professional liability insurance coverage  this insurance does not cover claims made after expiration of our current insurance contracts 
generally accepted accounting principles require that we record a liability for incurred but not reported ibnr professional liability claims if they are estimable and probable  and for which we have not yet contracted for insurance coverage 
the company uses actuarial assumptions to estimate and record its ibnr liability and has a million ibnr liability recorded as of june  current insurance market conditions include increases in premium cost  higher self insured retentions and reductions in aggregate excess coverages  trends that are anticipated to continue 
we expect these trends to be reflected in our future annual insurance renewals  and as a result  we will continue to assess our ability to secure future insurance coverage 
in anticipation of the possibility of future reductions in risk transfer from pcic to reinsurers  as well as the trend toward a generally hardening insurance market  the firms that own pcic  including the company  have been increasing pcic s capital in fiscal years and in light of increasing worldwide litigation  including litigation against professionals  the company has been implementing a requirement that all client relationships be documented by engagement letters containing specific risk mitigation clauses that were not included in all historical client agreements 
nearly percent of the company s us corporate clients have signed engagement letters including mitigation clauses  and initiatives to complete that process in the united states and elsewhere are underway 
the company has disengaged from certain client relationships where satisfactory engagement terms could not be achieved
