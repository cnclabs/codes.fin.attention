higher sales volumes contributed to the greater efficiencies in production while improved product quality and reliability has translated to lower warranty expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from of sales for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  in actual dollars  selling  general and administrative expenses were up over the prior year

intercompany sales are eliminated from the consolidated sales totals 
within the chassis group  the motorhome chassis line had a sales decline of over the fiscal year

in addition  improved product quality and reliability translated to lower warranty expense in selling  general and administrative expenses increased from of sales for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  in actual dollars  selling  general and administrative expenses were up only 
this increase was primarily due to increases in commercial and health insurance costs as well as an increase in the company s michigan single business tax sbt

effect of inflation inflation affects the company in two principal ways 
first  the company s debt  if any  is tied to the prime and libor rates so that increases affecting interest rates may be translated into additional interest expense 
second  general inflation impacts prices paid for labor  parts and supplies 
whenever possible  the company attempts to cover increased costs of production and capital by adjusting the prices of its products 
however  the company generally does not attempt to negotiate inflation based price adjustment provisions into its contracts 
since order lead times can be as much as six months  the company has limited ability to pass on cost increases to its customers on a short term basis 
in addition  the markets served by the company are competitive in nature  and competition limits the pass through of cost increases in many cases 
the company strives to minimize the effect of inflation through cost reductions and improved productivity 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risk exposure is a change in interest rates in connection with its outstanding variable rate short term and long term debt 
however  at december   the company had no debt outstanding under its variable rate short term and long term debt agreements 
the company does not enter into market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes
