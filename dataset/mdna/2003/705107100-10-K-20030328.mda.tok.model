see acquisitions 
we derive substantially all of our revenues from fees for consulting services 
we generate these fees from contracts with various payment arrangements  including time and materials contracts  fixed price contracts and cost reimbursable contracts 
during  revenues from these contract types were approximately  and  respectively  of total revenues 
we expect this approximate mix of business to continue in we typically issue invoices monthly to manage outstanding accounts receivable balances 
we recognize revenues on time and materials contracts as the services are provided 
we recognize revenues on fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method as services are performed over the life of the contract  based on the costs we incur in relation to the total estimated costs 
we recognize and make provisions for any anticipated contract losses 
fixed price contracts are attractive to clients  and while subject to increased risks  provide opportunities for increased margins 
we recognize revenue on cost reimbursable contracts as services are provided 
these revenues are equal to the costs incurred in providing these services plus a proportionate amount of the fee earned 
we have historically recovered all of our costs on cost reimbursable contracts  which means we have lower risk and our margins are lower on these contracts 
our historical revenue growth is attributable to various factors  including an increase in the size and number of projects for existing and new clients 
existing clients from the previous fiscal year generated approximately of our revenues in  approximately of our revenues in and approximately of our revenues in we manage our client development efforts through each of our strategic service groups  each having specific client responsibility and focus 
as of december   we had  personnel and on march  we had  personnel 
in  we derived approximately of our revenue through relationships with prime contractors  which contract directly with the end client and subcontract with us 
with the exception of the eds nmci subcontract  in most of these engagements we retain full responsibility for the end client relationship and direct and manage the activities of our contract staff 
during we had two customers that each accounted for more than of our total revenue 
eds nmci accounted for of the revenue and our biometric identification system through a subcontract with an undisclosed federal agency non releasable per contractual restrictions accounted for 
our most significant expense is direct costs  which consist primarily of project personnel salaries and benefits  and direct expenses incurred to complete projects 
our direct costs as a percentage of revenues are also related to the utilization rate of our consulting employees 
we manage utilization by frequently monitoring project requirements and timetables 
the number of consulting employees assigned to a project will vary according to the size  complexity  duration and demands of the project 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs associated with our executive management  finance and administrative groups  human resources  unassigned consulting employees  employee training  occupancy costs  depreciation and amortization  travel and all other branch and corporate costs 
sales and marketing expenses include the costs of sales and marketing personnel and costs associated with marketing and bidding on future projects 
other income consists primarily of interest income earned on our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
acquisitions on august   we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of viking for million cash plus the assumption of debt in a business combination accounted for as a purchase 
viking is a provider of integrated software and advanced technology solutions to state and local law enforcement  fire  and emergency medical service agencies 
the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the net assets was approximately million 
at the time of the acquisition  viking had personnel 
on november   we acquired all of the outstanding common shares of troy for million of cash and common stock valued at million in a business combination accounted for as a purchase 
troy derives revenue from system development  networking  engineering  integration services  and information systems security and its primary customer is the federal government

critical accounting policies and significant estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires that management make estimates and assumptions affecting the assets and liabilities including contingent assets and liabilities reported at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the revenues and expenses reported for the periods presented 
actual amounts could differ from those estimates 
management bases its estimates on historical experience  current data  information related to performance and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the measurements that are most affected by management s estimates of future events are our revenue is derived primarily from contracts with the federal government 
in  and    of our contracts were fixed priced contracts 
revenues on fixed price contracts are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
such revenues are recorded based on the percentage of costs incurred in the applicable reporting period compared to the most recent estimates of total costs to complete each contract 
estimating future costs and  therefore  revenues and profits  is a process requiring a high degree of management judgment 
in the event of a change in total estimated contract cost or profit  the cumulative effect of such change is recorded in the period the change in estimate occurs 
in the event cost estimates indicate a loss on a contract  the total amount of such loss is recorded in the period 
depreciation and amortization periods for long lived assets  including property and equipment and intangibles 
realization values of various assets such as receivables  intangibles assets and goodwill 
the allowance for doubtful accounts reflects management s best estimate of probable losses based on historical experience  known troubled acounts and other currently available information

operating income 
operating income increased to million for from million for environmental costs 
we have not incurred any costs in association with environmental issues 
liquidity and capital resources prior to our ipo and follow on offering  we funded our operations primarily through cash generated from operations and the sale of common stock to employees 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  cash provided by operating activities was primarily from net income  adjusted downward for increased working capital levels  which were principally caused by increases in accounts receivable 
net cash used by investing activities was million for during  we purchased million of property and equipment and incurred million for capitalized software development costs 
we had million of net purchases of short term investments and million of net purchases of long term investments 
we also purchased the assets of vector for million in cash plus approximately million in acquisition costs 
at december   funds of million were held back in the transaction  of which million of escrow funds related to the acquisition were included in other current assets with a corresponding liability in other current liabilities 
during  we negotiated an equity position in a limited liability corporation the llc that constructed a build to suit office building 
we have contributed cash of  to the llc and have a ownership interest in the llc 
we also entered into a sixteen year lease agreement for the building that began on december  and will be the primary occupant 
due to the equity involvement in llc  we were considered to be the owner for accounting purposes of the property during the construction period in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 the effect of lessee involvement in asset construction 
this is the case even though we are not obligated to guarantee the non recourse mortgage obligation  nor were we involved in the management of the llc 
accordingly  through december   we recorded total construction costs totaling million with an offsetting long term lease obligation 
due to the fact that we were considered the owner of the building during the construction period  then effectively a sale and leaseback of the building occurs when construction is complete and the lease term begins 
as a result of our continued involvement in the llc  we are unable to use sale leaseback accounting under fas  accounting for leases  and the building  and offsetting long term lease obligation  must remain on our financial records 
eitf specifically excludes land acquisition costs from total project costs  therefore  the value of the land was not recorded on pec s accounting records during the construction phase 
therefore  for consistency  since we are unable to use sale leaseback accounting and land is excluded from this transaction  we are required to bifurcate the lease payments between the land and the building 
the land portion of the rent is treated as an operating lease 
the lease payments were allocated between the land and building based upon their relative fair values 
the fair value of the land was determined through a third party appraisal and the fair value of the building was determined based upon total construction costs 
the building portion of the lease payment is recast as interest and principal payments on the lease obligation 
the building and lease obligation are being amortized to fair value at the end of the lease term  such that if the lease is not extended there will be no gain or loss upon lease termination 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for during  we sold million of common stock through the exercise of employee stock options 
we also sold million of common stock through the employee stock purchase plan 
although dividends have been paid prior to  we expect to retain future earnings  if any  for use in the operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate paying any further cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
we believe that our current cash position is adequate for our short term and long term working capital and capital expenditure needs 
we maintain a million line of credit with bank of america  which bears interest at the one month libor rate plus basis points per annum and expires on april   and is in the process of being renewed 
as of december   we had no borrowings outstanding under the line of credit 
we did have outstanding million in letters of credit in lieu of rent deposits 
under some of our fixed price contracts  we receive advance payments for work to be performed in future months 
if we do not perform the work  the unearned portion of these advances will be returned to our clients 
by december   our accounts receivable turnover rate  net of advance payments on contracts  was approximately four times a year 
the following summarizes our obligations associated with leases and other commitments at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands total less than one year one to three years after three years operating leases     capital leases     total     as described above  we have entered into a lease for a build to suit facility  which was occupied december   and the lease term will expire december  recent accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb s emerging issues task force  or eitf  finalized eitf issue revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting 
it also addresses how arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting in an arrangement 
eitf does not apply to deliverables in arrangements to the extent the accounting for such deliverables are within the scope of other existing higher level authoritative accounting literature 
we have already adopted the provisions of eitf and the adoption has not had a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair market value based method of accounting for stock based compensation 
we do not presently expect to make such a voluntary change 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
these amended disclosure requirements are applicable for financial statements issued for interim periods beginning after december  in november  fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
  and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
 fin was issued 
fin clarifies the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  relating to guarantors accounting for  and disclosure of  the issuance of certain types of guarantees 
the disclosure provisions of fin are applicable to interim or annual periods that end after december   and did not have an impact on the december  financial statements 
the provisions for initial recognition and measurement under fin are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees that are issued or modified after december  management believes that the initial recognition and measurement provisions under fin will not have a material impact on its financial statements 
on january   the financial accounting standards board fasb or the board issued fasb interpretation no 
 fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
the provisions will be the guidance that determines whether consolidation is required under the controlling financial interest model of accounting research bulletin no 
arb  consolidated financial statements or other existing authoritative guidance or  alternatively  whether the variable interest model under fin should be used to account for existing and new entities 
at this time  the company does not have any entities that qualify under fin item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  including us treasury and agency obligations  money market instruments of domestic and foreign issuers denominated in us dollars of commercial paper  bankers acceptances  certificates of deposit  euro dollar time deposits and variable rate issues  corporate note and bonds  asset backed securities  repurchase agreements  municipal notes and bonds and auction rate preferred securities 
investments in both fixed and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of risk 
fixed securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted because of a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our company s future investment income may fall short of expectations because of changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have seen a decline in market value because of changes in interest rates 
a change in interest rates could have approximately a  impact on our interest income 
our investments are made in accordance with an investment policy approved by the board of directors 
under this policy no investment securities can have maturities exceeding two years and the average duration of the portfolio cannot exceed months
