item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  which involve risk and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including but not limited to those discussed in risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we develop  manufacture  sell and support integrated automation systems for the semiconductor  or chip  and flat panel display  or fpd  manufacturing industries 
our systems are designed to enable semiconductor and fpd manufacturers to increase their manufacturing productivity and yield and to protect their investment in fragile materials and work in process 
we sell our systems directly to semiconductor and fpd manufacturers  as well as to original equipment manufacturers  or oems  that integrate our systems with their equipment for sale to semiconductor manufacturers 
in response to the industry downturn  we have reduced costs in several areas 
in october  we began transitioning substantially all of our manufacturing to solectron corporation  which we believe will reduce our fixed manufacturing costs and improve our ability to respond to sales fluctuations 
over the past two years  we have also reduced our workforce from a peak of approximately  employees to approximately employees 
we sell our products principally through a direct sales force worldwide 
our functional currency is the us dollar  except in japan where our functional currency is the japanese yen 
the costs and expenses of our international subsidiaries are recorded in local currency  and foreign currency translation adjustments are reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets 
acquisitions in october  we purchased a percent interest in asyst shinko  inc asi or asyst shinko  a japanese corporation 
in may  asyst connectivity technologies  inc  or act  a wholly owned subsidiary of asyst  purchased substantially all of the assets of domainlogix corporation  or dlc  a delaware corporation 
in may  we acquired percent of the common stock of gw associates  inc  or gw  a california corporation 
in february  we acquired percent of the common stock of advanced machine programming  inc  or amp  a delaware corporation and manufacturer of precision parts 
we sold this subsidiary in march in february  we acquired percent of the common stock of semifab  inc  or semifab  a delaware corporation and manufacturer of environmental control equipment and a contract manufacturer 
we sold this subsidiary in march in fiscal  we acquired a majority ownership percentage of mecs  a japanese engineering and robotics manufacturing company  and in fiscal our ownership percentage increased percent to percent 
mecs is now merged into aji  a wholly owned subsidiary of asyst 
all of the above transactions were accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  our consolidated statements of operations and of cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended march  include the results of these acquired entities for the periods subsequent to their respective acquisitions  as applicable 
we consolidate fully the financial position and results of operations of asi and account for the minority interest in the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates general our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  investments  deferred tax assets  income taxes  warranty obligations and restructuring and impairment charges 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
some of our products are large volume consumables that are tested to industry and or customer acceptance criteria prior to shipment 
revenue for these types of products is recognized at shipment 
certain of our product sales are accounted for as multiple element arrangements 
if we have met defined customer acceptance experience levels with both the customer and the specific type of equipment  we recognize the product revenue at the time of shipment and transfer of title  with the remainder when the other elements  primarily installation  have been completed 
other products are highly customized systems that cannot be completed or adequately tested to customer specifications prior to shipment from the factory 
we do not recognize revenue for these products until formal acceptance by the customer 
revenues from long term contracts are recognized using the percentage of completion method of contract accounting  based on the ratio that costs incurred to date bear to estimated total costs at completion 
when using the percentage of completion method  revisions in revenue and cost estimates are recorded in the periods in which the facts that require such revisions become known and losses  if any  are provided for in the period in which such losses are first identified by management 
we utilize the percentage of completion method due to the significance of the service effort and the length of time of the contracts 
revenue for spare parts is recognized on shipment 
revenue related to maintenance and service contracts is recognized ratably over the duration of the contracts 
unearned maintenance and service contract revenue is not significant and is included in accrued liabilities 
we account for software revenue recognition in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  software revenue recognition 
revenues for integration software work are recognized on a percentage of completion basis 
software license revenue  which is not material to the consolidated financial statements  is recognized when the software is shipped  payment is due within one year  collectibility is probable and there are no significant obligations remaining 
allowance for doubtful accounts we estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts based on a combination of specifically identified amounts and a general reserve calculated based on the aging of receivables 
if circumstances change such as 
table of contents an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us or its payment trends  we may adjust our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us 
inventory reserves we evaluate the recoverability of all inventory  including raw materials  work in process  finished goods  and spare parts to determine whether adjustments for impairment are required 
inventory which is obsolete or in excess of our demand forecast is fully reserved 
if actual demand is lower than our forecast  additional inventory write downs may be required 
goodwill and other intangible assets effective april   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

sfas no 
requires that goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
furthermore  sfas no 
includes provisions on the identification of intangible assets  reclassification of certain intangible assets from previously reported goodwill  and reassessment of the useful lives of existing intangible assets 
at march   we had million of goodwill and intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  recorded on our balance sheet 
we completed an annual goodwill impairment test in the third quarter of fiscal the first step of the test identifies if an impairment may have occurred  while the second step of the test measures the amount of the impairment  if any 
as a result of the test  a goodwill impairment expense of million was recognized 
to determine the amount of the impairment  we estimated the fair value of our reporting segments that contained goodwill based primarily on expected future cash flows  reduced the amount by the fair value of identifiable intangible assets other than goodwill also based primarily on expected future cash flows  and then compared the unallocated fair value of the business to the carrying value of goodwill 
to the extent goodwill exceeded the unallocated fair value of the business  an impairment expense was recognized 
in connection with the annual impairment analysis for goodwill  we assessed the recoverability of the intangible assets subject to amortization in accordance with sfas no 
during fiscal  an impairment expense of million was recognized for acquired technology and million was recognized for customer base  based upon our projection of significantly reduced future cash flows of act 
warranty accrual our warranty policy generally states that we will provide warranty coverage for a predetermined amount of time  generally or months  for material and labor to repair and service our equipment 
in fiscal we outsourced all of our product manufactured in the united states to solectron corporation 
solectron assumes the warranty liability for the first months on product it manufacturers  with asyst liable for warranty obligations thereafter 
we record the estimated warranty cost upon shipment of our product 
the estimated warranty cost is determined based on the warranty term and historical warranty costs for a specific product 
if actual product failure rates or material usage differs from our estimates  we may need to revise our estimated warranty reserve 
accounting for income taxes we have recorded a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have considered our future taxable income and tax planning strategies in assessing our valuation allowance 
future taxable income is based upon our estimates  and actual results may significantly differ from these estimates due to the volatility of our industry 
if in the future we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax in excess of the net amount recorded  we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset  increasing income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  
table of contents should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset  charging income in the period such determination was made 
results of operations net sales net sales for the fiscal year ended march  were million  an increase of million or percent from the prior year 
the increase in fiscal sales was due primarily to the establishment of asi 
excluding the impact of asi  net sales for fiscal were million  an increase of million or percent from the prior year 
the increase was primarily attributable to increased sales to customers in china and taiwan  partially offset by decreased sales to customers in north america 
net sales for the fiscal year ended march  were million  a decrease of million or percent from fiscal the reduction in fiscal sales was directly attributable to the reduced capital spending of semiconductor manufacturers due to the general decline in demand for chips 
gross profit because the semiconductor capital equipment industry is subject to rapid increases and decreases in demand  we have made significant reductions and changes in our manufacturing operations to decrease the fixed component of our manufacturing costs and improve our margins during downturns 
in fiscal we reduced our manufacturing headcount and consolidated manufacturing into two facilities versus four 
in fiscal we began transitioning all of our us manufacturing operations to solectron  a contract manufacturer 
we expect this outsourced manufacturing model will significantly improve our gross profits on outsourced products in fiscal and beyond 
our gross profit was million for the fiscal year ended march   million for the fiscal year ended march  and million for the fiscal year ended march  this represents percent of net sales for the fiscal year ended march   percent of net sales for the fiscal year ended march  and percent of net sales for the fiscal year ended march  the improvement as a percent of sales in fiscal was primarily attributable to increased sales volumes  which better absorbed manufacturing overhead  facility and headcount reduction actions taken in the prior fiscal year  and higher mix of mm products  offset by lower gross margins on our asyst shinko amhs products 
the decrease in fiscal versus the prior year was primarily attributable to significantly reduced sales  as well as a million inventory reserve recorded in fiscal research and development we believe that research and development  or r d  of new automation solutions and the enhancement of current products are critical to our competitiveness 
we believe it is important to maintain our commitment to these development programs during industry downturns so that we will be positioned with competitive products during upturns 
our ongoing commitment to r d is evidenced by our consistent level of spending over the past three fiscal years despite the dramatic up and down changes in sales 
r d expenses were million for the fiscal year ended march   million for the fiscal year ended march  and million for the fiscal year ended march  this represents percent of net sales for the fiscal year ended march   percent of net sales for the fiscal year ended march  and percent of net sales for the fiscal year ended march  we increased r d spending in fiscal as we continued strategic product development programs and added the r d spending of asi and act  although r d as a percentage of sales decreased due to higher sales 
the decrease in fiscal spending from fiscal resulted from the reduction or elimination of certain mm engineering programs  although r d as a percentage of sales increased significantly due to the drop in sales 

table of contents selling  general and administrative over the past two years we have reduced selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses to better align our spending with lower sales levels 
our efforts were evident in fiscal as sg a expenses declined to million  or percent of net sales  compared with million  or percent of net sales in fiscal sg a expense was million for the fiscal year ended march   representing percent of net sales for the period 
the decreases in fiscal and fiscal resulted primarily from workforce reductions  facility closures  and reduced discretionary spending offset in fiscal by increases due to acquisitions of asi and dlc 
in the first month of fiscal we made additional reductions in sg a expenses  primarily through workforce reductions  in response to continued market weakness 
amortization of acquired intangible assets amortization expenses relating to acquired intangible assets were million for the fiscal year ended march   million for the fiscal year ended march  and million for the fiscal year ended march  this represents percent of net sales for the fiscal year ended march   percent of net sales for the fiscal year ended march  and percent of net sales for the fiscal year ended march  we amortize acquired intangible assets over periods ranging from three to ten years 
the increase in amortization expenses in fiscal is primarily due to the acquisition of the asi joint venture interest

table of contents employees  including manufacturing  sales  research and development and administrative staff 
we also recorded a fixed asset impairment charge of million for assets disposed of due to our headcount reductions and vacating facilities 
in fiscal  we recorded restructuring charges in connection with our plan to shut down some of our manufacturing and service locations  outsource some of our manufacturing activities and consolidate the remainder of our domestic manufacturing in fremont  california  as well as to reduce our workforce due to economic conditions 
these charges included approximately million in write downs of assets and reserves for lease commitments  net of estimated sublease income that we expect to generate from the vacated facilities  and severance costs of approximately million related to reductions in force of approximately employees or approximately percent of our workforce 
we expect to utilize approximately million of the remaining balance of million during  and the remaining balance  primarily unused leased facilities  over the following three fiscal years 
asset impairment charges asset impairment charges for fiscal years  and were as follows fiscal years ended march  goodwill and intangible impairment land impairment totals in fiscal  we completed an annual goodwill impairment test and determined that impairment charges of million were required because the estimated fair value of certain businesses were less than their book values

based upon market data at june  and our noncancelable commitment to purchase the land  we estimated that the then market value of the land had been impaired and recorded a million write down to its estimated market value during the quarter ended june  we recorded an additional million write down in fiscal based on our revised estimate of market value 
we continue to hold the land for sale 
in process research and development costs of acquired businesses in october  we acquired percent of the common stock of asi  our japanese amhs joint venture company

in june  we acquired dlc 
in connection with the purchase price allocation million was assigned to ipr d 
in may  we acquired gw associates 
in connection with the purchase price allocation million was assigned to ipr d 
the amount allocated to ipr d was determined through established valuation techniques in the high technology 
table of contents industry and was expensed upon acquisition  as it was determined that the projects had not reached technological feasibility at the time of our acquisition

to date has not had a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
the interpretation elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees  including loan guarantees such as standby letters of credit 
it also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee  the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value  or market value  of the obligations it assumes under the guarantee and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements 
the provisions related to recognizing a liability at inception of the guarantee for the fair value of the guarantor s obligations does not apply to product warranties or to guarantees accounted for as derivatives 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  we  as permitted under california law and in accordance with our bylaws  have indemnification obligations to our officers and directors for certain events or occurrences  subject to certain limits  while they were serving at our request in such capacity 
the maximum amount of potential future indemnification is unlimited  however  we have a director and officer insurance policy that enables us to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
as a result of the insurance policy coverage  we believe the fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal 
our sales agreements indemnify our customers for any expenses or liability resulting from claimed infringements of patents  trademarks or copyrights of third parties 
the terms of these indemnification agreements are generally perpetual any time after execution of the agreement 
the maximum amount of potential future indemnification is unlimited 
however  to date  we have not paid any claims or been required to defend any lawsuits with respect to any claim 
prior to december   we guaranteed certain lease payments with respect to equipment and real estate of our japanese subsidiary as disclosed in note we have not recorded a liability for the amount of our guarantee

and related interpretations 
accordingly  compensation expense for stock options is measured as the excess  if any  of the estimate of the market value of our stock at the date of the grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire our stock

the notes are convertible  at the option of the holder  at any time on or prior to maturity into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share  which is equal to a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes 
the notes mature july   pay interest on january and july of each year and are redeemable at our option after july  we had million and million at march  and  respectively  of short term debt from banks in japan 
as of march   the interest rate ranged from percent to percent interest rates ranged from percent to percent at march  
we had secured straight bonds from a bank in japan of million at march  the bonds bore interest at rates ranging from percent to percent as of march  and mature in fiscal year certain of our assets in japan have been pledged as security for these secured straight bonds as well as for short term debt 
as of march   pledged assets consist of land and other property and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation  time deposits and accounts receivable totaling million 
additionally we have provided letters of guarantee to financial institutions in japan covering substantially all of aji s debts 
we lease facilities under non cancelable finance and operating leases  with expiration dates ranging from august to november we anticipate that operating expenses will constitute a material use of our cash resources 
the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry makes it very difficult for us to predict future liquidity requirements with 
table of contents certainty 
any upturn in the semiconductor industry may result in short term uses of cash in operations as cash may be used to finance additional working capital requirements such as accounts receivable 
however  we believe that our available cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our working capital and operating expense requirements for at least the next twelve months 
at some point in the future we may require additional funds to support our working capital and operating expense requirements or for other purposes and we may seek to raise these additional funds through public or private debt or equity financings or the sale of assets 
these financings may not be available to us on a timely basis if at all or  if available  on terms acceptable to us and not dilutive to our shareholders 
if we fail to obtain acceptable additional financing  we may be required to reduce planned expenditures or forego investments  which could reduce our revenues  increase our losses  and harm our business 
risk factors this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  including statements about our future plans  objectives  intentions and expectations 
many factors  including those described below  could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in any forward looking statements 
the semiconductor manufacturing industry is highly cyclical  and the current substantial downturn is harming our operating results 
our business is entirely dependent upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers  which at any point in time are dependent on the then current and anticipated market demand for chips  as well as products utilizing ics 
the semiconductor industry is cyclical and has historically experienced periodic downturns 
these periodic downturns  whether the result of general economic changes or capacity growth temporarily exceeding growth in demand for chips  are difficult to predict and often have a severe adverse effect on the semiconductor industry s demand for tools 
sales of tools to semiconductor manufacturers may be significantly more cyclical than sales of chips  as the large capital expenditures required for building new fabs or facilitizing existing fabs is often delayed until chip manufacturers are confident about future demand growth 
if demand for semiconductor equipment remains depressed for an extended period  it will seriously harm our business 
the industry is currently experiencing a significant downturn due to decreased worldwide demand for semiconductors from peak levels reached in during this downturn  most of our customers have reduced capital expenditures  which has adversely impacted our business 
our net sales declined percent from their peak in the third quarter of fiscal to the third quarter of fiscal excluding sales of asi  which was acquired during the third quarter of fiscal  our net sales declined sequentially in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal we currently expect sales to decline further in the first quarter of fiscal we cannot assure you that our sales will recover sufficiently for us to return to profitability in the near future 
as a result of substantial cost reductions in response to the decrease in net sales and uncertainty over the timing and extent of any industry recovery  we may be unable to make the investments in marketing  research and development and engineering that are necessary to maintain our competitive position  which could seriously curtail our long term business prospects 
we believe that the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry will continue  leading to industry downturns  which may seriously harm our business and financial position 
we have existing debts  and may not be able to secure additional financing to meet our future capital needs 
we currently anticipate that our available cash resources  which include existing cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  cash generated from operations and other existing sources of working capital will be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for working capital and capital expenditures through at least the next twelve months 
in october  we entered into and fully drew down a million year revolving credit agreement with comerica bank california 
we are required under this agreement to 
table of contents maintain compliance with financial covenants  including a total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio  tangible net worth and minimum liquidity covenants 
the amount of the credit line available to us may change based on the amount of receivables we have and reductions in the non formulary piece of the credit line which is subject to periodic review and amendment 
additionally  our japanese subsidiary  aji  has loans outstanding with japanese banks totaling approximately million  substantially all of which is guaranteed by the us parent company 
we may be unable to meet the financial covenants contained in our credit agreement with comerica 
if we are unable to meet the covenants  comerica may require us to repay the outstanding balance 
if the amount of credit available to us changes  we may also be required to repay some or all of the outstanding balance 
the japanese banks may call our outstanding loans  requiring repayment  some of which would be paid by the us parent under existing loan guarantees 
this could leave us with inadequate cash resources to effectively manage the business and require us to obtain additional financing 
in july  we completed the sale of million of percent convertible subordinated notes which are convertible  at the option of the holder  at any time on or prior to maturity into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share  which is equal to a conversion rate of shares per  principal amount of notes 
the notes mature july   pay interest on january and july of each year and are redeemable at our option after july  we may be unable to obtain any required additional financing on terms favorable to us  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to fund our expansion  successfully develop or enhance products  respond to competitive pressures or take advantage of acquisition opportunities  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may pursue additional funds to support our working capital and operating expense requirements or for other purposes 
we may pursue these additional funds through public or private debt  equity financings or the sale of assets 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities  our shareholders may experience dilution of their ownership interest  and the newly issued securities may have rights superior to those of the common stock 
if we raise additional funds by issuing debt  we may be subject to limitations on our operations 
this strain on our capital resources could adversely affect our business 
our new credit facility contains restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to expand or pursue our business strategy 
the million credit facility we entered into in october restricts  without agreement from our lender  comerica bank california  our ability to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends and make distributions in respect of our capital stock  redeem capital stock  make investments or other restricted payments  engage in transactions with stockholders and affiliates  create liens  sell or otherwise dispose of assets  make payments on our subordinated debt  and engage in mergers and acquisitions 
we are also required under the credit facility to maintain compliance with financial tests  including a total leverage ratio and net worth and liquidity covenants 
we may not be able to maintain these ratios 
covenants in the credit facility may also impair our ability to expand or pursue our business strategies 
our operating and 
table of contents financial performance  changes in business conditions or results of operations  adverse regulatory developments or other events beyond our control may impair our ability to comply with these covenants and other provisions of the credit facility 
in addition  if we do not comply with these covenants  we may be required to negotiate new terms and conditions with our lender  or the lender may accelerate our debt under the credit facility 
new terms and conditions could be more restrictive than under the current credit facility 
if the indebtedness under the credit facility is accelerated  we may be required to repay all outstanding indebtedness in full 
forced repayment of our indebtedness would reduce our available cash balances 
any of these scenarios could have an adverse impact on our operating or financial performance or could impair our ability to expand or pursue our business strategies 
upon the occurrence of a change of control as defined in the indenture for our subordinated convertible notes due in  we will be required to offer to repurchase those notes at percent of the principal amount of the notes  together with accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to the date of purchase 
however  we are prohibited under our new credit facility  and may be prohibited under indebtedness we may incur in the future  from purchasing any notes prior to their stated maturity 
in such circumstances  we will be required to repay all or a portion of the outstanding principal and any accrued interest under the credit facility and any such other future indebtedness  or obtain the requisite consent from the lender under the credit facility and the holders of any other future indebtedness to permit the repurchase of the notes 
if we are unable to repay all of this indebtedness or are unable to obtain the necessary consents  we will be unable to offer to repurchase the notes  which would constitute an event of default under the indenture for the notes  which in turn would constitute a default under our new credit facility and could constitute a default under the terms of any future indebtedness that we may incur 
we may not effectively compete in a highly competitive semiconductor equipment industry 
the markets for our products are highly competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
we currently face direct competition with respect to all of our products 
in addition  the facility automation market has periods of rapid consolidation 
some of our competitors  especially following consolidation  may have greater name recognition  more extensive engineering  manufacturing and marketing capabilities and substantially greater financial  technical and personnel resources than those available to us 
brooks automation  inc and tdk are our primary competitors in the area of isolation systems 
our smart traveler system products face competition from bar code technology as well as brooks and a number of smaller competitors 
we also compete with several companies in the robotics area  including  but not limited to  brooks automation  newport corp  rorze corporation and yasukawa super mectronics division 
in the area of amhs  our products face competition from daifuku co  ltd  murata co  ltd  and brooks automation 
our wafer and reticle sorters compete primarily with products from recif  inc and brooks automation 
in addition  the transition to mm wafers is likely to draw new competitors to the facility automation market and may result in additional consolidation 
in the mm wafer market  we expect to face intense competition from a number of companies such as brooks automation  as well as potential competition from semiconductor equipment and cleanroom construction companies 
we expect that our competitors will continue to develop new products in direct competition with our systems  improve the design and performance of their products and introduce new products with enhanced performance characteristics 
in order to remain competitive  we need to continue to improve and expand our product line  which will require us to maintain a high level of investment in research and development 
ultimately  we may not be able to make the technological advances and investments necessary to remain competitive 
new products developed by our competitors or more efficient production of their products could increase pricing pressure on our products 
in addition  companies in the semiconductor capital equipment industry have been facing pressure to reduce costs 
either of these factors may require us to make significant price reductions to avoid losing orders 
further  our current and prospective customers continuously exert pressure 
table of contents on us to lower prices  shorten delivery times and improve the capabilities of our products 
failure to respond adequately to such pressures could result in a loss of customers or orders 
our gross margins on mm products may be lower than on mm products  which could result in decreased profitability 
the gross margins on our mm products currently are not as favorable as on our mm products 
this is primarily because our mm products are early in their production life  we face increased competition in this production line and we sell a greater percentage of our mm products directly to oems rather than chip manufacturers 
the mm market is still relatively new 
manufacturing costs are generally higher in the early stages of new product introduction and decrease as demand increases  due to better economies of scale and efficiencies developed in the manufacturing processes 
however  we cannot assure you that we will see such economies of scale and efficiencies in our future manufacturing of mm products 
we face increased competition for our mm products because of the development of semi standards for mm products 
while chip manufacturers purchased a majority of mm automation products  oem manufacturers are purchasing most of the tool automation products for mm 
these and other factors may prevent us from achieving or maintaining the same relative pricing and gross margin performance on mm products as we have achieved on mm products 
because the semiconductor manufacturing industry is subject to rapid demand shifts which are difficult to predict  our inability to efficiently manage our manufacturing capacity and inventory levels in response to these rapid shifts may cause a reduction in our gross margins  profitability and market share 
the semiconductor manufacturing industry experiences rapid demand shifts 
our ability to respond to these demand shifts is limited because we incur manufacturing overhead  inventory expense and other costs  many of which are fixed in the short term  based on projections of anticipated customer demand 
during a downturn  our ability to quickly reduce our production costs may be hampered by manufacturing commitments and accrued inventory based on earlier and more optimistic projections of demand 
if market demand does not match our projections  we will have to carry or write off excess and obsolete inventory and our gross margins will decline which  in turn  could prevent us from operating profitably 
for example  we incurred an inventory charge in the fiscal fourth quarter of of million which was associated with additional inventory reserves for obsolete and excess inventory 
this inventory accumulated largely due to the steep decline in demand for our products 
furthermore  if we do not accurately predict the demand for our mm and mm automation products  we could encounter additional problems with excess and obsolete inventory 
during periods of increasing demand  our ability to satisfy increased customer demand may be constrained by our projections 
if our projections underestimate demand  we may have inadequate inventory and may not be able to easily expand our manufacturing capacity  which could result in delays in shipments and loss of customers 
even if we are able to sufficiently expand our capacity  we may not be able to do so efficiently  which would adversely affect our gross margin and profitability 
while our outsourcing agreement with solectron includes commitments from solectron as to how quickly they can increase or decrease manufacturing based on updates to our forecast demand 
solectron may be unable to meet these commitments and  even if it can  we may be unable to react efficiently to rapid fluctuations in demand 
we depend on large purchases from a few significant customers  and any loss  cancellation  reduction or delay in purchases by  or failure to collect receivables from  these customers could harm our business 
the markets in which we sell our products are comprised of a relatively small number of oems and semiconductor manufacturers 
large orders from a relatively small number of customers account for a significant portion of our revenue and makes our relationship with each customer critical to our business 
this 
table of contents concentrated customer base is even more pronounced at asi 
we may not be able to retain our largest customers or attract additional customers  and our oem customers may not be successful in selling their equipment with our embedded systems 
our success will depend on our continued ability to develop and manage relationships with significant customers 
in addition  our customers have in the past sought price concessions from us and may continue to do so in the future  particularly during downturns in the semiconductor market 
further  some of our customers may in the future shift their purchases of products from us to our competitors 
additionally  the inability to successfully develop relationships with additional customers or the need to provide future price concessions would have a negative impact on our business 
if we are unable to collect a receivable from a large customer  our financial results will be negatively impacted 
in addition  since each customer represents a significant percentage of net sales  the timing of the completion of an order can lead to a fluctuation in our quarterly results 
as we complete projects for a customer  business from that customer will decline substantially unless it undertakes additional projects incorporating our products 
we may experience lost sales due to outsourcing of most of our product manufacturing  which could negatively impact our business 
in an effort to focus on core competencies and reduce the impact of cyclical peaks and troughs on our operating results  we have outsourced the manufacturing of our us products to solectron corporation 
outsourcing may not yield the benefits we expect  and instead could result in increased product costs  and product delivery delays 
outsourced manufacturing could create disruptions in the availability of our products if the timeliness or quality of products delivered does not meet our requirements 
these problems could be caused by a number of factors including  but not limited to manufacturing process flow issues  financial viability of an outsourced vendor  availability of raw materials to the outsourced vendor  improper product specifications  and the learning curve to commence manufacturing at a new outsourced site 
if products are delayed because of problems in outsourcing we may lose sales and profits 
if our agreement with solectron terminates or if solectron does not perform its obligations under our agreement  it could take several months to establish alternative manufacturing for these products and we may not be able to fulfill our customers orders for most of our products in a timely manner 
if our agreement with solectron terminates  we may be unable to find another suitable external manufacturer 
any delays in meeting customer demand or quality problems resulting from product manufactured at an outsourced location could have a material negative impact on our net sales and results of operations  and could result in reduced future sales to key customers 
if we are unsuccessful in fully commercializing our fastrack automated materials handling system  and or we cannot generate new business from our asyst shinko joint venture  our growth prospects could be negatively impacted 
amhs is an important component of our growth strategy 
we have completed only one successful commercial installation of our fastrack system in a mm fab 
our fastrack system currently is not a complete amhs solution  and we may not be successful in some or all of our current efforts to develop or otherwise obtain the additional components that comprise a complete solution 
if we are able to offer a complete solution  we still could find it difficult to compete against companies with greater experience and resources in the amhs market 
in addition  our joint venture company  asyst shinko  may not continue to succeed in the mm amhs market  and may not be able to help us gain market acceptance for fastrack 
any failure to win market acceptance of our products  either fastrack or joint venture products  would negatively impact our growth prospects 

table of contents because we do not have long term contracts with our customers  our customers may cease purchasing our products at any time if we fail to meet their needs 
we do not have long term contracts with our customers 
as a result  our agreements with our customers do not provide any assurance of future sales 
accordingly our customers can cease purchasing our products at any time without penalty  our customers are free to purchase products from our competitors  we are exposed to competitive price pressure on each order  and our customers are not required to make minimum purchases 
sales are typically made pursuant to individual purchase orders and product delivery often occurs with extremely short lead times 
if we are unable to fulfill these orders in a timely manner  we could lose sales and customers 
the timing of the transition to mm technology is uncertain and competition may be intense 
we have invested  and are continuing to invest  substantial resources to develop new systems and technologies to automate the processing of mm wafers 
however  the timing of the industry s transition from the current  widely used mm manufacturing technology to mm manufacturing technology is uncertain  partly as a result of the recent period of reduced wafer fabrication capacity utilization 
delay in the adoption of mm manufacturing technology could adversely affect our potential revenue 
manufacturers implementing factory automation in mm pilot projects may initially seek to purchase systems from multiple vendors 
competition  including price competition  for these early mm orders could be vigorous 
a vendor whose system is selected for an early mm pilot project may have  or be perceived to have  an advantage in competing for future orders  and thus the award to a competitor of one or more early mm orders could cause our stock price to fall 
if our fully integrated tool front end solutions are not widely accepted  our growth prospects could be negatively impacted 
our portal solutions offers our oem customers a complete  automated interface between the oem s tool and the fab  an alternative to designing and manufacturing automated equipment front ends for their tools utilizing purchased components and in house engineering and manufacturing resources 
the decision by oems to adopt our system for a large product line involves significant organizational  technological and financial commitments by the oems 
oems expect the portal solutions to meet stringent design  reliability and delivery specifications 
to date  we have penetrated only a small percentage of oem tools 
we believe that our growth prospects in the oem market depend in large part upon our ability to gain acceptance of the portal solutions and follow on products by a broader group of oem customers 
if we fail to satisfy these expectations  whether based on limited or expanded sales levels  oems will not adopt the portal solutions 
we cannot assure you that these tools will be widely accepted in the marketplace or that additional oems will adopt the system 
notwithstanding our solution  oems may purchase components to assemble interfaces or invest in the development of their own complete interfaces 
if our products are not adopted by oems  our prospects will be negatively impacted and our profits substantially harmed 
if we are unable to develop and introduce new products and technologies in a timely manner  our business could be negatively impacted 
semiconductor equipment and processes are subject to rapid technological changes 
the development of more complex semiconductors has driven the need for new facilities  equipment and processes to produce these devices at an acceptable cost 
we believe that our future success will depend in part upon our ability to continue to enhance our existing products to meet customer needs and to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner 
we often require long lead times for development of our products  which requires us to expend significant management effort and incur material development costs and other expenses 
during 
table of contents development periods we may not realize corresponding revenue in the same period  or at all 
we may not succeed with our product development efforts and we may not respond effectively to technological change 
we may not be able to efficiently integrate the operations of our acquisitions and may incur substantial losses in the divestiture of assets or operations 
we have made and may continue to make additional acquisitions of  or significant investments in  businesses that offer complementary products  services  technologies or market access 
our recent acquisitions include our percent ownership in asi  as well as dlc  gw  semifab  amp and mecs corporation 
we subsequently merged mecs into aji 
during fiscal we sold semifab  amp and our wafer and reticle carrier product lines 
in the future we may make additional acquisitions of  or significant investments in  businesses that offer complementary products  services  technologies or market access 
for example  in may  we completed the asset purchase from dlc  and in october we completed the acquisition of a percent ownership of asi 
if we are to realize the anticipated benefits of past and future acquisitions  the operations of these companies must be integrated and combined efficiently with those of asyst 
the process of integrating supply and distribution channels  computer and accounting systems and other aspects of operations  while managing a larger entity  has in the past and will continue to present a significant challenge to our management 
in addition  it is not certain that we will be able to incorporate different technologies into our integrated solution 
we may not succeed with the integration process and we may not fully realize the anticipated benefits of the business combinations 
for example  in fiscal  we decided to discontinue operations of our semifab and amp subsidiaries  as these subsidiaries were not considered critical to our long term strategy 
these subsidiaries were sold at the end of fiscal we may be required to record significant future impairment costs  such as the million and million charge recorded in fiscal and  respectively in the event that the carrying value exceeds the fair value of acquired intangible assets 
the dedication of management resources to such integration or divestitures may detract attention from the day to day business  and we may need to hire additional management personnel to successfully rationalize our acquisitions or divestitures 
the difficulties of integration may increase because of the necessity of combining personnel with disparate business backgrounds and combining different corporate cultures 
we may incur substantial costs associated with these activities and we may suffer other material adverse effects from these integration efforts which could materially reduce our short term earnings 
consideration for future acquisitions could be in the form of cash  common stock  rights to purchase stock or a combination thereof 
dilution to existing shareholders and to earnings per share may result if shares of common stock or other rights to purchase common stock are issued in connection with any future acquisitions 
we may be unable to protect our intellectual property rights and we may become involved in litigation concerning the intellectual property rights of others 
we rely on a combination of patent  trade secret and copyright protection to establish and protect our intellectual property 
while we intend to take reasonable steps to protect our patent rights  we cannot assure you that our patents will not be challenged  invalidated or avoided  or that the rights granted thereunder will provide us with competitive advantages 
we also rely on trade secrets that we seek to protect  in part  through confidentiality agreements with employees  consultants and other parties 
these agreements may be breached  we may not have adequate remedies for any breach  or our trade secrets may otherwise become known to  or independently developed by  others 
intellectual property rights are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
we may unknowingly infringe on the intellectual property rights of others and may be liable for that infringement  which could result in significant liability for us 
if we do infringe the intellectual property rights of others  we could be forced to either seek a license to intellectual property rights of others or alter our products so that they no longer infringe the intellectual property rights of others 
a license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all 
similarly  changing our products or processes to avoid infringing the rights of others may be costly or impractical or could detract from the value of our product 

table of contents there has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in semiconductor related industries 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our patents  to protect our trade secrets or know how  to defend asyst against claimed infringement of the rights of others or to determine the scope and validity of the patents or intellectual property rights of others 
any litigation could result in substantial cost to us and divert the attention of our management  which by itself could have an adverse material effect on our financial condition and operating results 
further  adverse determinations in any litigation could result in our loss of intellectual property rights  subject us to significant liabilities to third parties  require us to seek licenses from third parties or prevent us from manufacturing or selling our products 
any of these effects could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
because our quarterly operating results are subject to variability  quarter to quarter comparisons may not be meaningful 
our revenues and operating results can fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter depending on factors such as the timing of significant customer orders  the timing of product shipment and acceptance  variations in the mix of products sold  the introduction of new products  changes in customer buying patterns  fluctuations in the semiconductor equipment market  the availability of key components  lost sales due to outsourcing of manufacturing  pressure from competitors  and general trends in the semiconductor manufacturing industry  electronics industry and overall economy 
the sales cycle to new customers ranges from to months from initial inquiry to placement of an order  depending on the complexity of the project 
this extended sales cycle makes the timing of customer orders uneven and difficult to predict 
a significant portion of the net sales in any quarter is typically derived from a small number of long term  multi million dollar customer projects involving upgrades of existing facilities or the construction of new facilities 
generally  our customers may cancel or reschedule shipments with limited or no penalty 
these factors increase the risk of unplanned fluctuations in net sales 
moreover  a shortfall in net sales in a quarter as a result of these factors could negatively impact our operating results for the quarter 
given these factors  we expect quarter to quarter performance to fluctuate for the foreseeable future 
in one or more future quarters  our operating results are likely to be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  which may cause our stock price to decline 
shortages of components necessary for our product assembly can delay our shipments and can lead to increased costs which may negatively impact our financial results 
when demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment is strong  our suppliers  both domestic and international  strain to provide components on a timely basis and  in some cases  on an expedited basis at our request 
disruption or termination of these sources could have a serious adverse effect on our operations 
many of the components and subassemblies used in our products are obtained from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers 
a prolonged inability to obtain some components could have an adverse effect on our operating results and could result in damage to our customer relationships 
shortages of components may also result in price increases for components and as a result  could decrease our margins and negatively impact our financial results 

table of contents we face significant economic and regulatory risks because a majority of our net sales are from outside the united states 
a significant portion of our net sales are attributable to sales outside the united states  primarily in taiwan  japan  china  singapore and europe 
we expect that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenue in the future 
this concentration increases our exposure to any risks in this area 
sales to customers outside the united states are subject to various risks  including exposure to currency fluctuations  the imposition of governmental controls  the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as do the laws of the united states  the need to comply with a wide variety of foreign and us export laws  political and economic instability  trade restrictions  changes in tariffs and taxes  longer payment cycles typically associated with foreign sales  the greater difficulty of administering business overseas  and general economic conditions 
in addition  in taiwan  our business could be impacted by the political  economic and military conditions in that country 
china does not recognize taiwan s independence and the two countries are continuously engaged in political disputes 
both countries have continued to conduct military exercises in or near the others territorial waters and airspace 
these disputes may continue or escalate  resulting in an economic embargo  a disruption in shipping or even military hostilities 
the political instability in taiwan could result in the creation of political or other non economic barriers to our being able to sell our products or create local economic conditions that reduce demand for our products among our target market 
in both taiwan and japan  our customers are subject to risk of natural disasters  which  if they were to occur  could harm our revenue 
semiconductor fabrication facilities have in the past experienced major reductions in foundry capacity due to earthquakes in taiwan and japan 
for example  in  taiwan experienced several earthquakes which impacted foundries due to power outages  physical damage and employee dislocation 
our business could suffer if a major customer s manufacturing capacity was adversely affected by a natural disaster such as an earthquake  fire  tornado or flood 
the recent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome  or sars  which has had particular impact in china  hong kong  taiwan and singapore  could have a negative effect on our operations 
a significant portion of our net sales are made in asia 
also  our outsourced manufacturing is conducted in singapore 
our operations may be impacted by a number of sars related factors  including  among other things  disrupting operations at our customers  supplier or our operations 
any kind of economic instability in taiwan and japan or other parts of asia where we do business can have a severe negative impact on our operating results due to the large concentration of our sales activities in this region 
for example  during and  several asian countries  including taiwan and japan  experienced severe currency fluctuation and economic deflation  which negatively impacted our revenues and also negatively impacted our ability to collect payments from customers 
during this period  the lack of capital in the financial sectors of these countries made it difficult for our customers to open letters of credit or other financial instruments that are guaranteed by foreign banks 
the economic situation during this period exacerbated a decline in selling prices for our products as our competitors reduced product prices to generate needed cash 
although we invoice a majority of our international sales in united states dollars  for sales in 
table of contents japan  we invoice our sales in japanese yen 
future changes in the exchange rate of the us dollar to the japanese yen may adversely affect our future results of operations 
european and asian courts might not enforce judgments rendered in the united states 
there is doubt as to the enforceability in europe and asia of judgments obtained in any federal or state court in the united states in civil and commercial matters 
the united states does not currently have a treaty with many european and asian countries providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters 
therefore  a final judgment for the payment of a fixed debt or sum of money rendered by any federal or state court in the united states based on civil liability would not automatically be enforceable in many european and asian countries 
the intellectual property laws in asia do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
it may be necessary or useful for us to participate in proceedings to determine the validity of our  or our competitors  intellectual property rights in asia  which could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business 
if we are unable to defend our intellectual property rights in asia  we may face direct competition  which could materially adversely affect our future business  operating results and financial condition 
anti takeover provisions in our articles of incorporation  bylaws and our shareholder rights plan may prevent or delay an acquisition of asyst that might be beneficial to our shareholders 
our articles of incorporation and bylaws include provisions that may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying changes in control or management of asyst 
these provisions include certain advance notice procedures for nominating candidates for election to our board of directors  a provision eliminating shareholder actions by written consent and a provision under which only our board of directors  our chairman of the board  our president or shareholders holding at least percent of the outstanding common stock may call special meetings of the shareholders 
we have entered into agreements with our officers and directors indemnifying them against losses they may incur in legal proceedings arising from their service to asyst  including losses associated with actions related to third party attempts to acquire asyst 
we have adopted a share purchase rights plan  pursuant to which we have granted to our shareholders rights to purchase shares of junior participating preferred stock 
upon the earlier of the date of a public announcement that a person  entity  or group of associated persons has acquired percent of our common stock or business days following the commencement of  or announcement of  a tender offer or exchange offer  the rights granted to our shareholders will become exercisable to purchase our common stock at a price substantially discounted from the then applicable market price of our common stock 
these rights could generally discourage a merger or tender offer involving the securities of asyst that is not approved by our board of directors by increasing the cost of effecting any such transaction and  accordingly  could have an adverse impact on shareholders who might want to vote in favor of such merger or participate in such tender offer 
in addition  our board of directors has authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to fix the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without any future vote or action by the shareholders 
the issuance of preferred stock  while providing desirable flexibility in connection with possible acquisition and other corporate purposes  could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock  thereby delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of asyst 
furthermore  such preferred stock may have other rights  including economic rights senior to the common stock  and as a result  the issuance thereof could have a material adverse effect on the market value of the common stock 
we have no present plans to issue shares of preferred stock

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures regarding market risk interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to the investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio consists of short term fixed income securities and by policy is limited by the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
as stated in our investment policy  we ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in safe and high credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer  guarantor or depository 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
these securities  like all fixed income instruments  carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities have their fair market value adversely affected due to rise in interest rates 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by percent from levels at march  and at march   the fair market value of these investments would decline by an immaterial amount 
we also have the ability to keep our fixed income investments fairly liquid 
therefore  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio 

table of contents the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates for the investment portfolio at march  our intent is not to hold investments longer than twelve months 
restricted cash  cash equivalents and short term investments represent amounts that are restricted as to their use primarily in accordance with a debt agreements more fully described in note to our financial statements dollars in thousands average carrying interest remaining maturities amount rate cash equivalents institutional money market funds within year  us corporate debt securities within year  total cash equivalents restricted cash and cash equivalents us corporate debt securities within year  foreign currency exchange risk 
we engage in international operations and transact business in various foreign countries 
the primary foreign currency cash flows are located in japan  china  taiwan  singapore and europe 
although we operate and sell products in various global markets  substantially all sales are denominated in the us dollar  except in japan  therefore reducing the foreign currency risk factor 
in march  we began to employ a foreign currency hedge program utilizing foreign currency forward exchange contracts in japan 
to date  the foreign currency transactions and exposure to exchange rate volatility have not been significant 
there can be no assurance that foreign currency risk will not be a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flow in the future
