item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should always be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those discussed in factors that may affect future operating results and elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a leading provider of supply chain management solutions for the healthcare industry 
through a combination of technology  information and services  our web based solutions are designed to enable effective collaboration among hospitals and suppliers  helping them to reduce operational inefficiencies and lower costs 
the healthcare supply chain has a number of characteristics  including its large size  high degree of fragmentation  reliance on disparate technologies  dependence on manual processes and highly complex pricing structures  that have led to major inefficiencies 
these inefficiencies lead to slower transactions and increased overhead and costs for suppliers and hospitals 
in addition  the participants in the healthcare industry are under significant competitive and cost pressures and are seeking ways to improve efficiencies in their supply chain to improve overall margins 
our web based solutions make it easier for the participants in the healthcare supply chain  principally hospitals  suppliers and gpos  to improve communication  receive comprehensive and accurate information  improve day to day operations  accelerate order and contract implementations  enhance strategic planning and gain organization wide visibility into supply chain activities 
our operations have grown significantly since inception 
we have significantly increased the number of customers  both hospitals and suppliers  that use our solutions  and we have introduced new and enhanced solutions to offer to these customers 
because of the growth in usage and adoption of marketplace novation  we have generated increasing levels of marketplace volume related to marketplace novation 
however  as a result of our adoption of emerging issues task force abstract no 
 or eitf no 
 our reported marketplace revenue does not reflect the level of fees we receive from related parties for these marketplace services 
as a result of the application of eitf no 
 we offset the amortization of capitalized partnership costs resulting from the equity consideration provided to related parties against the fees received from those related parties  thereby resulting in an offset of the related party revenue reported see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the application of eitf no 

from inception through fiscal  our operating expenses increased substantially  primarily due to charges related to impairment of assets held for divestiture  write down of non marketable investments and impairment of intangibles  as well as increases in amortization of partnership costs relating to our outsourcing and operating agreement  or the outsourcing agreement  effective may   with novation  vha  uhc and hppi 
in fiscal  however  operating expenses decreased significantly from fiscal due to improved operational execution and use of our resources  reduced amortization of intangibles  an increase in related party fees that was offset by amortization of partnership costs  a reduced level of charges associated with the write down of non marketable investments and also because there were no impairments of intangibles or assets held for divestiture 

table of contents strategic relationship in connection with the outsourcing agreement  we issued approximately million shares of our common stock to vha  representing approximately of our then outstanding common stock  and approximately million shares of our common stock to uhc  representing approximately of our then outstanding common stock 
we also issued warrants to vha and uhc  allowing vha and uhc the opportunity to earn up to approximately million and approximately  additional shares of our common stock  respectively  over a four year period by meeting specified performance targets 
these performance targets are based upon the historical purchasing volume of vha and uhc member healthcare organizations that sign up to use marketplace novation  which is available only to the patrons and members of vha  uhc and hppi 
the targets increase annually to a level equivalent to total healthcare organizations representing billion of combined purchasing volume at the end of these issuances of our common stock and warrants to purchase our common stock to vha and uhc were approved by our stockholders on july  under the outsourcing agreement  we have agreed to provide specific functionality to marketplace novation 
novation has agreed to act as our exclusive agent to negotiate agreements with suppliers to offer their equipment  products  supplies and services through marketplaces sponsored by novation or hppi  including marketplace novation 
vha  uhc  hppi and novation have each agreed not to develop or promote any other internet based exchange for the acquisition or disposal of products  supplies  equipment or services by healthcare provider organizations 
in october  we and vha agreed to amend our common stock and warrant agreement to provide for the cancellation of the performance warrant to purchase approximately million shares of our common stock 
in substitution for the warrant  we issued to vha approximately million shares of our restricted common stock 
on january   we and uhc agreed to amend our common stock and warrant agreement to provide for the cancellation of the remaining unexercised portion of the performance warrant to purchase up to  shares of our common stock 
in substitution for the warrant  we issued to uhc  shares of our restricted common stock 
both vha s and uhc s restricted shares are subject to forfeiture if the performance targets contained in their original warrants are not met 
in january  we amended and restated the outsourcing agreement  or the amended outsourcing agreement 
under the terms of the amended outsourcing agreement  novation agreed to increase the minimum fee level to us under the outsourcing agreement  which minimum fee level is based on a percentage of marketplace volume processed through marketplace novation 
the fee level is determined based on a tiered fee structure under which the incremental fee per dollar of transaction volume decreases as the marketplace volume processed through marketplace novation increases 
this structure results in a higher blended fee percentage at lower volume levels and a lower blended fee percentage at higher volume levels 
under the terms of the amended outsourcing agreement  the payments novation is required to make are subject to quarterly maximums  above which additional marketplace volume does not result in additional fees from novation 
these maximums were based on a predetermined schedule that provided for increasing dollar amounts through beginning in through the remaining term of the amended outsourcing agreement  these maximums were to be calculated based on novation s financial performance  as defined 
the amended outsourcing agreement also included modifications to revenue sharing provisions under which we agreed to share specified fees we receive for products and services sold through or related to our current and future marketplaces 
we agreed to share with novation revenue related to transactions through marketplace novation and from other current or future marketplaces as well as revenue related to the distribution or licensing of software and other technology solutions 
we are not required to share revenue related to current or future marketplaces sponsored by other gpos  except for specified types of purchases 
for the term of the amended outsourcing agreement  we are not required to share with novation revenue related to any of the above transactions in any quarter until we have achieved specified minimum transaction fees related to marketplace novation transactions 
to date  no revenue sharing has occurred under the amended outsourcing agreement 
the amended outsourcing agreement also includes modifications to certain supplier recruitment and supplier implementation provisions 

table of contents in september  we amended the amended outsourcing agreement 
pursuant to this amendment to the amended outsourcing agreement  or amendment  all parties agreed to expand the definition of marketplace volume to include supply chain data captured for marketplace novation member purchases when the purchase was not facilitated by our connectivity solution 
as a result  we are able to provide our customers within marketplace novation with information relating to all purchases made by hospitals from suppliers that have agreed to provide this transaction data as part of their participation in marketplace novation 
the amendment accelerates our ability to capture critical supply chain data and enables us to capture important purchasing information without first requiring full adoption of our connectivity services 
in september  we further amended and restated the amended outsourcing agreement 
as stated above  the payments that novation is required to make are subject to quarterly maximums 
these quarterly maximums were based on a predetermined fee schedule through among other changes  this revision to the amended outsourcing agreement  or revised amended outsourcing agreement  reduced the quarterly maximums for the third and fourth quarters of in the third and fourth quarters of  the fees we received from novation were limited to these revised maximums 
in addition  fees in certain periods prior to the effective date of the revised amended outsourcing agreement were limited to the maximums in place in those periods 
beginning in  the quarterly maximums for a given year are now based on novation s estimated financial performance  as defined  for that year 
in the third quarter of each year  the quarterly maximums for the third and fourth quarters of that year are subject to adjustment based on any revisions to novation s estimated full year financial performance for that year 
any difference in the calculated quarterly maximums for the year that results from differences between novation s estimated and actual financial performance for that year will increase or decrease the quarterly maximums in the subsequent year 
for  based on our expectations regarding the levels of marketplace volume that will be processed through marketplace novation  we expect that the fees we earn from novation will continue to be limited to the quarterly maximums 
as a result  based on these expectations for  marketplace volume above a certain level will not result in incremental fees being paid by novation because of the maximums 
in and  the fees paid to us by novation totaled million and million  respectively see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the application of eitf no 

we currently expect the rate of growth  if any  and the absolute dollar growth  if any  in the fees we receive from novation in to be significantly less than we experienced from to we currently expect that the fees paid by novation for the first six months of  on an annualized basis  will represent a slight increase from the million paid by novation in additionally  under the revised amended outsourcing agreement  the scope of novation s rights to view data from any customer that was limited to data from novation and hppi sponsored marketplaces only 
also  novation now only has the exclusive right to recruit suppliers for novation and hppi sponsored marketplaces and not for any other current or future marketplaces 
from time to time  we and novation have discussed further amendments to our outsourcing agreement  and any such amendment could affect future fees under this agreement 
in january  we entered into stock purchase agreements with vha  uhc and i technologies  under which these entities purchased a total of approximately million shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
we raised a total of million prior to costs associated with the sale of the shares  which were million  including an advisory fee to our investment bankers 
acquisitions in july  we acquired substantially all of the assets of medcontrax  inc and med ecorp  inc 
in a single transaction 
the total purchase price was approximately million in cash 
the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the basis of their respective fair values on the acquisition date 
in the allocation of the purchase price      and  were allocated to tangible assets  a proprietary database  developed technology  goodwill and acquired in process research and development  respectively 
the proprietary database and developed technology are being amortized over their estimated useful lives of three years and five years  respectively 
goodwill is not being amortized 
the  allocated to acquired in process research and development represented the estimated fair value  based on risk adjusted cash flows related to incomplete research and development projects 
at the date of the acquisition  the 
table of contents development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility  and the research and development in progress had no alternative future use 
accordingly  the  was expensed as of the acquisition date 
in december  we acquired substantially all of the assets of revelocity  a developer of web based software products that provide rapidly deployable supply chain management capabilities for hospitals and healthcare suppliers that help them streamline procurement processes  manage inventories  track project and patient costs  leverage bar coding efficiencies in internal distribution and share replenishment demand information 
contingent upon the amount of revenue generated by the acquired business through december   we may issue between approximately  and  shares of our common stock in total related to this acquisition 
these shares will be valued as earned 
accordingly  the amount of goodwill recognized in this acquisition will be adjusted as additional shares are earned 
as of december   approximately  shares  valued at  have been issued 
in addition to these shares and the shares of the common stock that may be issued based upon revenue generated by the acquired business  the purchase price included forgiveness of a  note receivable from revelocity and the assumption of liabilities of  the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the basis of their respective fair values on the acquisition date 
in the allocation of the purchase price   million and million were allocated to tangible assets  developed technology and goodwill  respectively 
the developed technology is being amortized over its estimated useful life of five years 
goodwill is not being amortized 
other matters since inception  we have incurred significant losses and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of million 
in  we expect that our losses will decrease as compared to fiscal as a result of several factors 
these factors primarily relate to anticipated reductions in non cash charges  such as amortization of partnership costs  amortization of deferred compensation and write down of notes receivable  as well as anticipated increases in revenue 
as a result of the application of eitf no 
 non cash amortization of partnership costs is being offset against these fees received from related parties up to the lesser of related party revenue or amortization of partnership costs in any period  resulting in a reduction in the amortization classified as an operating expense see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the application of eitf no 

we have a limited operating history on which to base an evaluation of our business and prospects 
you must consider our prospects in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in the early stages of development  particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets such as the market for web based supply chain management solutions for the healthcare industry 
to address these risks  we must  among other things  expand our customer base  enter into new strategic alliances  increase the functionality of our solutions  implement and successfully execute our business and marketing strategy  respond to competitive developments and attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
we may not be successful in addressing these risks  and our failure to do so could seriously harm our business 
critical accounting policies and estimates we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable and notes receivable  estimating litigation reserves and other accrued liabilities  and valuation of goodwill and intangible assets 
revenue recognition we derive our revenue from the solutions we provide to our customers 
marketplace revenue consists of transaction based fees and subscription based fees related to solutions delivered through marketplace novation  
table of contents and reflects revenue related to the services provided through neoforma oms and neoforma cms 
trading partner services revenue consists of software license fees  market intelligence services fees  contract management and administration services fees  subscription fees  implementation fees and fees from other value added services  and reflects primarily revenue related to neoforma dms  neoforma mms  market intelligence services and contract management and administration services 
as described below  significant management judgments must be applied in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
marketplace revenue transaction fees 
transaction fee revenue represents the negotiated percentage of the purchase price  or marketplace volume  of products in transactions between signed participants in marketplace novation that are either i processed by hospitals utilizing neoforma oms  or ii processed through means other than neoforma oms  but for which the transaction data is obtained and processed through neoforma oms for the benefit of our customers 
the gross marketplace value of a transaction is the price of a product as agreed to by the buyer and the supplier  regardless of whether the transaction occurs through neoforma oms  or whether we obtain the transaction data  process it and make it available to the customers who utilize the marketplace 
we recognize transaction fees on a net basis  because we do not believe that we act as a principal in connection with orders to be shipped or delivered by a supplier to a purchaser because  among other things  we do not establish the prices of products paid by buyers  take title to products to be shipped from the supplier to the buyer  nor do we take title to or assume the risk of loss of products prior to or during shipment  bear the credit and collections risk of the purchaser to the supplier  or bear the risk that the product will be returned 
subscription fees 
subscription fee revenue is generated from suppliers participating in marketplace novation that pay a monthly  quarterly or annual subscription fee that is not based on marketplace volume 
for these suppliers  we recognize their subscription fees ratably over the period of the subscription agreement  as that is the period over which the services are performed 
we also generate subscription fees through other agreements with suppliers that participate in marketplace novation that pay a periodic subscription fee calculated as a percentage of their periodic product sales under novation contracts 
we recognize these fees in the period that the contracted products are sold 
eitf no 
as a result of the application of eitf no 
 we offset the amortization of capitalized partnership costs resulting from the equity consideration provided to related parties against the fees received from those related parties  thereby resulting in a reduction of the related party revenue reported 
as a result  as discussed in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements  our reported related party marketplace revenue does not reflect the level of fees received from related parties for those marketplace services 
trading partner services revenue software license fees 
we apply the provisions of statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended  to all transactions involving the sale of software products 
we recognize revenue from the sale of software licenses when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the fee is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
in fiscal  all of our software license revenue related to a single three year technology license agreement between ghx and us to license portions of our neoconnect platform 
the revenue received under this agreement is being recognized ratably over the three year term of the agreement 
we anticipate that our recent acquisition of revelocity will result in increasing software license revenue in future periods 
market intelligence services and contract management and administration services fees 
our market intelligence services and contract management and administration services agreements provide for the delivery 
table of contents of specified reports or other data to our customers 
we recognize the fees related to these agreements upon delivery of the reports or  for time based access to reports or data  over the period of access 
implementation and services fees 
we recognize implementation fees and services fees  where they relate to the implementation or use of our solutions  ratably over the term of the underlying agreement 
revenue generated by implementation and services we perform in connection with the implementation of other solutions  applications or deliverables is recognized upon completion of the services 
estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable and notes receivable our management must make estimates of the collectability of both our accounts receivable and our notes receivable 
management analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
as of december   our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of  management also analyzes the financial condition of debtors for which we hold notes receivable 
if the financial condition of our customers or debtors were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
as of december   we had a notes receivable balance of million  against which no allowance has been provided 
estimating litigation reserves and other accrued liabilities management s estimate of the liability related to our pending litigation is based on claims and other information known to us and management s assessment of the probability of loss 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess and revise our estimates as appropriate 
revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operation and financial position in the period such revisions are made 
as of december   we had accrued  for potential liabilities related to our pending litigation 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets we assess the impairment of intangible assets  which currently consist of capitalized partnership costs and acquired database  developed technology and customer lists  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following loss of a major supplier or marketplace sponsor  significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  or a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of the intangible asset 
if we determine that the carrying value of an intangible asset may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we will measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
capitalized partnership costs  net of amortization  and acquisition related intangible assets  net of amortization  amounted to million and million  respectively  as of december  
table of contents in addition  we assess goodwill for impairment at least annually unless an event or change in circumstance indicates that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following our market capitalization falls below our net book value  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed of  or the testing for recoverability under statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
of a significant asset group within a reporting unit 
if we determine that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable based upon our annual impairment test or the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we would determine the fair value of our reporting units utilizing discounted cash flows and relative market multiples for comparable businesses 
we would then compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
if this evaluation indicated that impairment might exist for the reporting unit  we would then compare the carrying amount of goodwill in the reporting unit to the implied fair value of the goodwill to determine the amount of any impairment loss 
goodwill amounted to million at december  results of operations year ended december  as compared to year ended december  revenue marketplace revenue related party 
related party marketplace revenue consists of fees paid by novation for marketplace services 
for the years ended december  and  related party marketplace revenue consisted solely of fees paid by novation to us under the minimum fee level provisions of the outsourcing agreement  as amended  during those periods 
as a result of the adoption of eitf no 
 amortization of partnership costs resulting from the equity consideration issued to vha and uhc  the owners of novation  is classified as an offset against related party revenue  as opposed to being classified as an operating expense  up to the lesser of such related party revenue or amortization of partnership costs in any given period 
due to the offset of approximately million and million of amortization of partnership costs against related party marketplace revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively  there was no net related party marketplace revenue for either period 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the application of eitf no 
other 
other marketplace revenue consists of marketplace revenue received from customers that are not related parties  and consists generally of transaction based fees and subscription fees 
other marketplace revenue was million for the year ended december   an increase from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to increased revenue generated from suppliers related to their participation in marketplace novation  partially offset by a decrease of  in revenue as a result of the divestiture of neomd in march trading partner services revenue trading partner services 
trading partner services revenue consists of revenue generated from the sale of solutions that are complementary to our marketplace services 
currently  trading partner services revenue 
table of contents consists of revenue relating to market intelligence services and contract management and administration services provided to manufacturers and distributors  revenue relating to the sale of software and technology solutions  revenue relating to neoforma dms and revenue from other value added services to our customers 
the increase in trading partner services revenue from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  was primarily due to an increase of  in revenue related to the sale of a license to ghx to utilize portions of our neoconnect platform and revenue generated from our new market intelligence services and contract management and administration services 
the market intelligence services and contract management and administration services were introduced in connection with our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of medcontrax and med ecorp in july these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million as a result of the divestiture of the plan  auction and us lifeline  inc  or usl  operations in substantially all of the trading partner services revenue for was related to fdi information resources  llc  or fdi  part of our plan operations  and our auction and usl operations  all of which were divested later in sales of used equipment 
sales of used equipment consisted of the gross revenue generated from the sales of used and refurbished medical equipment that we owned as part of our now divested auction operations 
operating expenses cost of equipment sold 
cost of equipment sold consisted solely of the costs of owned inventory of used medical equipment held for sale as part of our now divested auction operations 
cost of services 
cost of services consists primarily of the costs to perform hospital and supplier implementation activities as well as the costs to obtain data for our solutions 
these expenditures consist primarily of technology costs  software licenses  salaries and other personnel expenses for our services personnel and fees for independent contractors and consultants 
cost of services decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the decrease was due to the fact that in the latter half of and into  our services group utilized fewer contractors and consultants resulting in a reduction of our costs relating to contractors and consultants by million in additionally  the number of full time employees in our services group decreased from at the beginning of to as of december   and subsequently increased to as of december  as a result  payroll related expenses decreased by million during as compared to we expect our cost of services to increase slightly in future periods as we continue to connect both hospitals and suppliers to our solutions and support and service an increasing number of customers on our solutions 
operations 
operations expenses consist primarily of expenditures for the operation and maintenance of our solutions and our technology infrastructure  including customer service 
these expenditures consist primarily of technology costs  software licenses  salaries and other personnel expenses for our operations personnel and fees for independent contractors and consultants 
operations expenses increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to a million increase in depreciation expense allocated to operations relating to assets which were placed into service during the year ended december  we expect our operations expenses to continue to increase as we expand our operating infrastructure and add content and functionality to our solutions 
product development 
product development expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses  fees to consultants and contractors and technology costs associated with the development and enhancement of our solutions and functionality 
product development expenses increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to increased depreciation of fixed assets allocated to product development 
we believe that continued investment in product development is critical to attaining our strategic objectives and  as such  we intend to continue to invest in this area 
as a result  we expect product development expenses to increase slightly in future periods 

table of contents selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  advertising  promotions and related marketing costs 
selling and marketing expenses decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to reduced selling and marketing personnel costs  as well as a reduction of million in the amortization of deferred compensation associated with selling and marketing personnel 
we focused the majority of our resources in on product development and implementation and integration efforts 
as a result  selling and marketing costs were at lower levels in as compared to  and headcount in our selling and marketing groups decreased from at the beginning of to as of december  and as of december  we do not expect selling and marketing costs to remain at these reduced levels in future periods 
we recognize that selling and marketing efforts are key to establishing ourselves as a leader in our industry and in branding our products and  as a result  we intend to continue to invest further in selling and marketing activities in we expect selling and marketing costs to increase during general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist of expenses for executive and administrative personnel  facilities  professional services and other general corporate activities 
general and administrative expenses decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a million reduction in amortization of deferred compensation in as compared to  partially offset by increased costs associated with the prior year audits conducted in in conjunction with the restatement of our and financial statements 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase slightly during as we make investments  primarily in personnel  to support our growth 
amortization of intangibles 
we amortize intangibles on a straight line basis over a period of three to five years 
amortization of intangibles decreased from million for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  during the fourth quarter of  we wrote down the intangible assets related to our acquisition of pharos technologies  inc and substantially all of the intangible assets relating to the acquisition of equipmd  inc  operated as neomd  as a result of our plans to divest these non core assets 
as a result of our divestiture of these assets  we no longer incur amortization expenses related to pharos and neomd 
during  we recorded intangible assets  other than goodwill  of million in connection with the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of medcontrax  med ecorp and revelocity 
the amortization of intangibles of  for the year ended december  related to these assets 
amortization of partnership costs 
amortization of partnership costs represents the amortization of the shares of our common stock issued to certain strategic partners 
as of december   capitalized partnership costs represented common stock and restricted common stock issued to vha and uhc in connection with entering into the outsourcing agreement with those entities and with novation 
we initially issued warrants to vha and uhc  but subsequently canceled these warrants and issued restricted common stock in substitution for the canceled warrants 
the value of the common stock issued is being amortized over a five year estimated useful life 
the restricted common stock issued in substitution for the warrants is being valued  and the related valuation is being capitalized  as the shares are earned 
the capitalized partnership costs relating to the restricted common stock are being amortized over the term of the agreement with the healthcare organizations that resulted in the shares being earned  generally two to three years 
amortization of partnership costs classified as an operating expense decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the decrease in amortization expense is the result of the increase in fees received from related parties as  under eitf no 
 amortization of partnership costs is classified as an offset against related party revenue  as opposed to being classified as an operating expense  up to the lesser of such related party revenue or amortization of partnership costs in any given period 
we offset approximately million and million of amortization of partnership costs against related party revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the amortization of partnership costs reported as an operating expense is reflected as an adjustment to reconcile net loss to cash from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
under eitf no 
 we account for the fees being paid by novation under the terms of the outsourcing agreement and subsequent amendments as if they were payments made for the equity 
table of contents consideration we provided to vha and uhc as opposed to payments for services 
as a result  the amortization of partnership costs that is offset against related party revenue is reported as a cash flow from financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
including the amortization offset against related party revenue under eitf no 
 amortization of partnership costs increased from approximately million to million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this increase was due to the fact that there were incremental partnership costs capitalized during fiscal and see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the application of eitf no 
see liquidity and capital resources for a further discussion of the outsourcing agreement and the related cash and accounting implications 
amortization of deferred compensation 
deferred compensation represents the aggregate difference  at the date of grant  between the cost to the employee of equity based compensation and the estimated fair value of the underlying equity instrument 
in the case of stock options  deferred compensation is calculated as the difference between the exercise price of the option and the fair value of the underlying stock on the date the option was granted 
we amortize deferred compensation from stock option grants on an accelerated basis over the vesting period of the underlying options  generally four years 
in connection with the grant of stock options to employees during fiscal  and  we recorded deferred compensation of million 
amortization of deferred compensation is reversed for any amounts recognized on options that do not vest due to employee terminations or employee attrition 
during the years ended december  and  we recorded million and  respectively  in reductions of deferred compensation 
we recorded amortization of this deferred compensation  net of reversals relating to forfeitures  of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
in connection with the assumption of certain stock options granted to employees of equipmd prior to our acquisition of equipmd in april  we recorded deferred compensation of million  representing the difference between the estimated fair value of the common stock for accounting purposes and the option exercise price of these options at the date of announcement of the acquisition 
this amount was presented as a reduction of stockholders equity and was being amortized over the vesting period of the applicable options using an accelerated method of amortization 
during the years ended december  and  we recorded million and million  respectively  in reductions of this deferred compensation as a result of employee terminations and employee attrition in this business  which we divested in march we recorded amortization of this deferred compensation  net of reversals relating to forfeitures  related to these options of million and  during the years ended december  and  respectively 
we no longer employ any equipmd employees due to the divestiture of the equipmd assets 
as such  we do not have any remaining deferred compensation related to these employees and we will no longer be incurring amortization expenses relating to this deferred compensation in future periods 
in late and in the first half of  in connection with the award of restricted stock to certain employees and officers  we recorded deferred compensation of million  which represents the fair value of the underlying common stock at the date of grant 
the restrictions on the stock lapse on various dates through february   subject to the continuous employment of the employees and officers with neoforma through those dates 
this amount is presented as a reduction of stockholders equity and will be amortized ratably over the period from the date of grant through the vesting date using the straight line method of amortization 
we recorded amortization of deferred compensation related to these shares of  and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the remaining total deferred compensation of million at december  is expected to be amortized as follows million during fiscal and  during fiscal the amortization expense relates to options and restricted stock awarded to employees and officers in all operating expense categories 
the amount of deferred compensation has been separately allocated to these categories in the consolidated statement of operations 

table of contents write off of purchased software 
during the years ended december  and  we recorded charges of million and  respectively  to write off purchased software licenses that we were no longer utilizing 
write off of acquired in process research and development 
for the year ended december   we recorded a charge of  to write off acquired in process research and development in connection with the medcontrax and med ecorp acquisition in july restructuring 
restructuring costs consist primarily of severance payments resulting from the streamlining and reorganizing of our operations and the divestitures of certain operations 
restructuring costs also include accrued rent relating to idle facilities 
there was no such write off during the year ended december  in december  we recorded a restructuring charge of  in connection with our decision to divest the auction and usl operations 
of the   related to the severance of employees and the remainder related to idle facilities and related costs 
the operations were sold in of the employees terminated  were from selling and marketing and were from operations 
during the year ended december   we recorded an additional restructuring charge of  of which  related to a revision of our estimate of the time required to sublease idle facilities of the auction operations and  related to severance costs for employees of the auction operations 
there were no additional restructuring charges related to these operations during the year ended december  in december  we recorded a restructuring charge of  in connection with our decision to divest the assets of equipmd 
of the   related to the severance of employees and  related to idle facilities and related costs

any projections of future long term cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty 
if our available funds and cash generated from operations are insufficient to satisfy our long term liquidity requirements  or if an event of default occurs under our credit agreement with vha and we are required to repay all outstanding indebtedness under the credit agreement  we might need to seek additional sources of funding  such as selling additional equity or debt securities or obtaining additional lines of credit 
we also might need to curtail expansion of our services  including reductions in our staffing levels and related expenses  or potentially liquidate selected assets 
if our management decides that it is in our best interest to raise cash to strengthen our balance sheet  broaden our investor base  increase the liquidity of our stock or for any other reason  we may decide to issue equity or debt  even if all of our current funding sources remain available to us 
if we issue additional securities to raise funds  those securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the rights of our common stock and our stockholders may experience dilution 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available to us on favorable terms when required  or at all 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in november  the eitf reached a consensus on eitf no 
 accounting for consideration given by vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
eitf no 
addresses whether consideration from a vendor to a reseller is i an adjustment of the selling prices of the vendor s products and  therefore  should be classified as an offset against revenue when recognized in the vendor s statement of operations or ii a cost incurred by the vendor for assets or services received from the reseller and  therefore  should be classified as a cost or expense when recognized in the vendor s statement of operations 
eitf no 
was required to be adopted no later than the first quarter of and upon adoption  companies were required to retroactively reclassify such amounts in previously issued financial statements to comply with the income statement classification requirements of eitf no 
on july   we issued equity consideration to vha and uhc in connection with the outsourcing agreement 
as a result of the application of eitf no 
 we have reclassified amortization associated with this equity consideration  historically classified as operating expenses  to an offset against related party revenue from those parties 
this treatment results in the classification of non cash amortization of partnership costs as an offset against related party revenue  as opposed to being classified as an operating expense  up to the lesser of such related party revenue or amortization of partnership costs in any period 
the following table summarizes the impact the application of eitf no 
had on our consolidated statements of operations year ended december  revenue related party marketplace revenue related party implementation revenue offset of amortization of partnership costs total related party revenue  as reported amortization of partnership costs amortization of partnership costs offset to related party revenue total amortization of partnership costs reported as an operating expense as a result of the adoption of eitf no 
 the amortization of partnership costs reported as an operating expense is reflected as an adjustment to reconcile net loss to cash from operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
under eitf no 
 we account for the fees paid by novation under the terms of the outsourcing agreement as if they are payments made for the equity consideration provided to vha and uhc as opposed to payments for services 
as a result  the amortization of partnership costs that is offset against related party revenue is reported as a cash flow from financing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
as reclassifications  these changes have no impact on our loss from operations  net loss  net loss per share or total cash flow 
see note application of eitf no 
to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the application of eitf no 
in july  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which became effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other acquired intangible assets 
it addresses how intangible assets that are acquired individually or with a group of other assets but not those acquired in a business combination should be accounted for in financial statements upon their acquisition 
sfas no 
also addresses how goodwill and other intangible assets should be accounted for after they have been initially recognized in the financial statements 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and certain other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer subject to amortization but will be tested at least annually for

sfas no 
also amends sfas no 
to require that certain lease modifications that have economic effects similar to sale leaseback transactions be accounted for in the same manner as sale leaseback transactions 
sfas no 
becomes effective for fiscal years beginning after may  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no

in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  or fin fin elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees  including loan guarantees such as standby letters of credit 
it also requires that at all times a company issues a guarantee  the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair market value of the obligations it assumes under that guarantee and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements

sfas no 
also amends the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an entity s accounting policy decision with respect to stock based employee compensation  and requires disclosure about those effects in both annual and interim financial statements 
sfas no

in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  or fin fin clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
for certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin applies to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
it applies in the fourth quarter of fiscal to variable interest entities in which a variable interest is acquired before february  the provisions of fin require immediate disclosure of certain information if it is reasonably possible that consolidation or disclosure of variable interest entities will be required when fin becomes effective 
we do not expect the adoption of fin to have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows as we do not currently participate in variable interest arrangements

table of contents factors that may affect future operating results the risks described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks not presently known to us  or that we currently deem immaterial  may also impair our business operations 
our business  financial condition or results of operations may be seriously harmed by any of these risks 
if our customers do not accept our business model of providing solutions to improve efficiencies in the healthcare supply chain  demand for our solutions may not develop as we expect and the price of our common stock may decline we have focused our efforts on developing solutions that address the inefficiencies in the healthcare supply chain 
this business model is new and unproven and depends upon participants in this market adopting a new way of doing business and exchanging information 
if participants in the healthcare supply chain do not accept our business model  demand for our solutions may not develop as we expect and the price of our common stock could decline 
some participants could be reluctant to accept our relatively new and unproven approach  which may not be consistent with their existing internal organization and procurement and sale processes 
some participants may prefer to use traditional methods of doing business  such as using paper catalogs and exchanging information in person or by phone 
our solutions and revenue model are untested and their acceptance is not assured our solutions are either of recent introduction or are currently under development and their acceptance by our existing and potential customers is therefore untested and uncertain 
our current business plan includes seeking a large portion of our revenue from participating suppliers 
obtaining the acceptance from such suppliers to pay our fees has proven difficult 
if suppliers do not accept our solutions or our fee model  it would have a serious negative impact on our business 
we have a history of losses  anticipate incurring losses in the foreseeable future and may never achieve profitability we have experienced losses from operations in each period since our inception  including a net loss of million for the twelve months ended december  in addition  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have not achieved profitability  and we expect to continue to incur operating losses in future quarters  primarily as a result of costs relating to the amortization of the stock we issued to vha and uhc and the costs and expenses relating to executing our strategy of developing solutions and services to address healthcare supply chain inefficiencies 
we will not achieve profitability unless we are able to significantly increase our revenue while adequately controlling our operating expenses  and we cannot assure you that we will ever be profitable 
our main source of business is derived from the solutions we provide through marketplace novation  and we rely on our relationship with our supply chain partners to drive participation in marketplace novation 
as a result our business may be seriously harmed if these relationships are materially altered or terminated we expect to rely significantly on our relationship with novation and  to a lesser extent  our other strategic allies  to bring hospitals and suppliers to marketplace novation 
under our revised amended outsourcing agreement  novation is our exclusive agent for signing up suppliers to participate in marketplace novation  subject to limited exceptions 
accordingly  we rely on novation to attract suppliers to marketplace novation and  if novation is unable to attract a sufficient number of suppliers  the value of marketplace novation to hospitals will be substantially decreased and our business will suffer 
novation currently requires suppliers to participate in marketplace novation as a requirement to sell contracted products to hospitals served by novation 
if novation ceases to require marketplace novation participation as a contract requirement  our ability to recruit suppliers to marketplace novation may be seriously harmed 
we rely significantly on vha 
table of contents and uhc to recruit and retain hospitals to marketplace novation 
these partners use a variety of marketing initiatives and financial incentives to drive adoption and use of marketplace novation and our solutions by hospitals 
if these partners cease using such marketing initiatives and financial incentives  our ability to recruit hospitals to marketplace novation also may be seriously harmed 
under the revised amended outsourcing agreement  we must meet detailed functionality and service level requirements 
if we are unable to achieve these required levels of functionality within a required time period  we may be required to pay significant liquidated damages or the revised amended outsourcing agreement could be terminated  which would seriously harm our business and financial results 
our ability to earn fees in future periods from marketplace novation depends on novation s performance we generate the substantial majority of our fees from marketplace novation 
our ability to earn fees from novation for the solutions we provide in connection with marketplace novation is dependent on several factors and the fees are subject to limitation by quarterly maximums  which are based on novation s financial performance 
if novation s performance declines  our ability to earn fees from novation in connection with marketplace novation will also decline 
our operating results are difficult to predict  and if we fail to meet the expectations of investors or securities analysts  the market price of our common stock will likely decline our revenue and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and are difficult to predict because of a number of factors 
these factors include the fees we collect from suppliers  the number and timing of new hospitals and suppliers that sign up to use our solutions and our ability to implement and train them  changes in the fees we charge users of our solutions  the timing of and expenses incurred in enhancing our solutions  the fees we collect from novation  which are subject to quarterly maximums that have been achieved in certain prior periods  the amount of related party revenue we offset by amortization of partnership costs  and the timing and size of any future acquisitions  fluctuations in our operating results may cause us to fail to meet the expectations of investors or securities analysts 
if this were to happen  the market price of our common stock would likely decline 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing for our future capital needs  we may be unable to develop new solutions or enhance the functionality of our existing solutions  expand our operations  respond to competitive pressures or continue our operations as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million of restricted cash and million in outstanding borrowings and notes payable  including million in principal outstanding under our credit agreement with vha 
we may need to raise additional funds within the next twelve months  notwithstanding the fact that our vha line of credit remains in place  if for example  we do not generate increased revenue or fees from our solutions  if we experience larger than anticipated operating losses or if we pursue additional acquisitions 
we may try to obtain additional financing by issuing shares of our common stock  which could dilute our existing stockholders and may cause our stock price to decline 

table of contents if an event of default were to occur under the vha credit agreement  vha could terminate the credit agreement and declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable 
if this were to occur  we may need to obtain an alternate source of funding  such as another credit line or an equity or debt financing  to repay amounts due under the credit agreement or for operational needs 
we believe that it would be difficult to obtain additional financing on favorable terms  if at all 
if we were unable to obtain alternate funding under these circumstances  our business would be seriously harmed and we could be forced to cease operations 
we recently acquired medcontrax  med ecorp and revelocity  and we may make additional acquisitions  which could harm our profitability  put a strain on our resources or cause dilution to our stockholders we acquired substantially all of the assets of medcontrax and med ecorp in july and revelocity in december we may decide that it would be in our best interests to make additional acquisitions to acquire new technologies  enhance or expand our solutions or for other reasons 
integrating newly acquired organizations and technologies into our company could be expensive  time consuming and may strain our resources 
in addition  we may lose current customers if any acquired companies have relationships with competitors of our users 
consequently  we may not be successful in integrating any acquired businesses or technologies and may not achieve anticipated revenue and cost benefits 
in addition  future acquisitions could result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt  contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to intangible assets  any of which could harm our business and could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
we must continue to enhance our capability to integrate our solutions with the technical systems of our hospital  supplier and gpo customers  otherwise these entities may not choose to utilize our solutions  which would harm our business if we do not maintain and expand the functionality and reliability of our solutions  hospitals and suppliers may not use them 
we must continue to develop the capability to integrate our solutions with our hospital and supplier customers business processes and information systems 
we may incur significant expenses in developing these capabilities and may not succeed in developing them in a timely manner 
in addition  developing the capability to integrate some of our solutions with suppliers and hospitals enterprise software systems will require the continued cooperation of and collaboration with the companies that develop and market these systems 
suppliers and hospitals use a variety of different enterprise software systems provided by third party vendors or developed internally 
this lack of uniformity increases the difficulty and cost of developing the capability to integrate with the systems of a large number of hospitals and suppliers 
failure to provide these capabilities would limit the efficiencies that our solutions provide and may deter our hospital and supplier customers from using our solutions 
to realize the benefit of our agreement with novation  we are required to integrate the systems of the hospitals purchasing through novation s program 
if the costs required to integrate these systems are substantially higher than anticipated  we may not realize the full benefit of these agreements 
if we were delayed or unable to integrate the systems of these hospitals  our financial situation would be adversely affected 
in addition  under our agreements with novation and medbuy  we must meet detailed functionality and service level requirements 
to the extent we are unable to or are delayed in providing this functionality  we may be unable to attract hospitals and suppliers to use our solutions and our financial situation may be adversely affected 
we incur significant costs in developing and supporting our solutions and in integrating with hospitals and suppliers information systems  and we may never generate sufficient revenue to offset these costs 

table of contents if our systems are unable to provide acceptable performance as the use of our solutions increases  we could lose customers  which could harm our business and results of operations we have supported only a limited number and variety of transactions through our solutions compared to the number and variety we expect to process in the future 
our systems may not accommodate increased use while providing acceptable overall performance 
we must continue to expand and adapt our network infrastructure to accommodate increased use of our solutions by our customers  which will be expensive 
if our systems do not continue to provide acceptable performance as use by our customers increases  our reputation may be damaged and we may lose customers 
we expect that a significant portion of the products and services used by hospitals that are sold through marketplace novation will come from a limited number of key manufacturers and distributors  and the loss of a key manufacturer or distributor could result in a significant negative impact on our financial situation we expect that a significant portion of the products to be sold through and fees to be generated from marketplace novation will come from a limited number of key manufacturers and distributors or as a result of purchases made from these manufacturers and distributors 
if any of these key manufacturers or distributors cease doing business with us  the fees we generate through marketplace novation could be significantly reduced 
our supplier agreements are nonexclusive and  accordingly  these suppliers can sell their products  supplies and equipment to hospitals directly or through our competitors 
we face significant competition  and if we are unable to compete effectively  we may be unable to maintain or expand the number of our customers and we may lose market share or be required to reduce prices the market for supply chain management solutions in healthcare is rapidly evolving and highly competitive 
because of the breadth of our solutions  which include order management  contract management  data management and materials management  we have a diverse set of competitors that compete with portions of our overall offering 
in order to best serve our customers  we sometimes partner with our competitors in one segment of the market while competing with them in others 
we believe that as our solution suite grows  we will continue to find areas of opportunity for both partnership and competition with other companies in the market that target a segment of the overall healthcare supply chain 
our ability to manage these relationships to benefit our hospital  supplier and gpo customers is important to our success 
our current and potential competitors include online marketplaces or exchanges targeted at the healthcare supply chain  such as the supplier sponsored ghx  with whom we also have a partnership agreement  gpos or supply management companies that have  or have announced plans for  online marketplaces or exchanges targeted at the healthcare supply chain  such as broadlane and medassets  suppliers that have created their own websites that offer order management functions to their customers for the sale of their products and services  enterprise resource application software vendors that offer enterprise resource planning applications  including procurement  to the healthcare market  such as lawson  mckessonhboc  oracle  peoplesoft and sap ag  with some of whom we also have partnership agreements  data management services providers and consultants  consulting firms that offer supply chain services  market intelligence  contract management and contract administration services providers  other software vendors that provide technology for inventory  materials  logistics and other supply chain related functions  and 
table of contents the status quo  or the historical means of doing business for many hospitals and suppliers  primarily phone  fax and paper 
competition is likely to intensify as our market matures 
as competitive conditions intensify  competitors may enter into strategic or commercial relationships with larger  more established healthcare  medical products or internet companies or with each other  secure services and products from suppliers on more favorable terms  devote greater resources to marketing and promotional campaigns  secure exclusive arrangements with hospitals that impede our sales  and devote substantially more resources to website and systems development and research and development 
our current and potential competitors services may achieve greater market acceptance than ours 
our current and potential competitors may have longer operating histories in the healthcare supply chain market  greater name recognition  larger customer bases or greater financial  technical and or marketing resources than we do 
as a result of these factors  our competitors and potential competitors may be able to respond more quickly to market forces  undertake more extensive marketing campaigns for their brands and services and make more attractive offers to hospitals and suppliers  potential employees and strategic allies 
in addition  new technologies may increase competitive pressures 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to expand our hospital and supplier base or retain our current hospitals and supplier customers 
we may not be able to compete successfully against our competitors  and competition could seriously harm our revenue  operating margins and market share 
if we are not able to increase recognition of the neoforma brand name  our ability to attract users to our solutions will be limited we believe that recognition and positive perception of the neoforma brand name in the healthcare industry are important to our success 
we intend to continue to invest in marketing programs and initiatives in order to build the value of our brand 
however  we may not achieve our desired goal of increasing the positive awareness of the neoforma brand name 
even if recognition of our name increases  it may not lead to an increase in the number of our customers or revenue 
if we are unable to safeguard the security and privacy of the confidential information of our customers  these customers may discontinue using our solutions a significant barrier to the widespread adoption of e commerce is the secure transmission of personally identifiable information of internet users as well as other confidential information over public networks 
if any compromise or breach of security were to occur  it could harm our reputation and expose us to possible liability 
we support encrypted communications protocols and encrypt certain information on our servers to protect user information during transactions  and we employ a security consulting firm that periodically tests our security measures 
despite these efforts  a party may be able to circumvent our security measures and could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our operations 
we may be required to make significant expenditures to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by any breaches and under certain contracts with customers would be liable for contractual damages due to security breaches 
we expect to derive a portion of our future revenue from information services that require the aggregation and blinding of data from our hospital and supplier customers 
to execute on our data services strategy  we must be able to secure the consent of our customers to various uses of their data 
to secure such consent  we must be able to assure these customers that we will at all times protect the confidentiality of their data 
if we are unable to provide such assurance  or if we fail to meet the levels of assurance provided  our ability to execute on our data services strategy may be seriously impaired 

table of contents if suppliers do not provide us with timely  accurate  complete and current information about their products and comply with government regulations  we may be exposed to liability or there may be a decrease in the adoption and use of our solutions if suppliers do not provide us in a timely manner with accurate  complete and current information about the products they offer  promptly update this information when it changes and provide us with accurate and timely invoicing data  our databases will be less useful to hospitals 
we cannot guarantee that the product information available from our solutions will always be accurate  complete and current  or that it will comply with governmental regulations 
this could expose us to liability if this incorrect information harms users of our services or results in decreased adoption and use of our solutions 
we also rely on suppliers using our solutions to comply with all applicable governmental regulations  including packaging  labeling  hazardous materials  health and environmental regulations and licensing and record keeping requirements 
any failure of our suppliers to comply with applicable regulations could expose us to civil or criminal liability or could damage our reputation 
if our contract counterparties do not supply us with the necessary data to populate our solutions  our solutions will lose value to our customers we have agreements with suppliers  distributors and other partners to populate our solutions with data  and if those suppliers  distributors or other counterparties terminated their agreements with us  we may not be able to provide the same quality or usefulness of solutions that we currently do 
if we could not provide this quality or usefulness  our customers may not value our solutions  and we would likely lose those customers 
because our supply chain partners are also our stockholders or are affiliated with our stockholders  we may find it difficult to attract competing companies to use our solutions our supply chain partners are also our stockholders or are affiliated with our stockholders or have strategic relationships with us 
for example  vha and uhc  the owners of novation  own approximately million and million shares of our common stock  respectively 
in addition  vha and uhc own approximately million shares and million shares  respectively  of restricted common stock which were subject to restrictions upon issuance  and of which a portion is still subject to those restrictions 
as of december   vha and uhc owned and  respectively  of our outstanding shares of common stock assuming they earned all the remaining shares of restricted stock 
these relationships may deter other potential customers  particularly those that compete directly with uhc  vha or novation  from using our solutions due to perceptions of bias in favor of one party over another 
this could limit the array of solutions we offer  damage our reputation and limit our ability to maintain or increase the number of our customers 
we have had to restate some of our financial results  and this may subject us to litigation because we restated our financial results for the first and second fiscal quarter of  as well as fiscal and  we could be subjected to litigation 
any claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming and costly to defend 
we may be subject to litigation for defects in products sold by suppliers using our solutions  and this type of litigation may be costly and time consuming to defend because certain of our solutions facilitate the sale of products by suppliers  we may become subject to legal proceedings regarding defects in these products  even though we generally do not take title to these products 
any claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming and costly to defend 

table of contents if we are unable to attract qualified personnel or retain our executive officers and other key personnel  we may not be able to compete successfully in our industry our success depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified  experienced employees 
we may not be able to compete effectively to retain and attract employees 
as a result  our employees may seek employment with larger  more established companies or companies they perceive to have better prospects 
should we fail to retain or attract qualified personnel  we may not be able to compete successfully in our industry  and our business would be harmed 
we believe that our ability to successfully execute our business strategy will depend on the continued services of executive officers and other key employees 
our executive employment agreements do not prevent these executives from terminating their employment at any time 
as a result  our employees  including these executives  serve at will and may elect to pursue other opportunities at any time 
the loss of any of our executive officers or other key employees could harm our business 
our growth and organizational changes have placed a strain on our systems and resources  and if we fail to successfully manage future growth and organizational changes  we may not be able to manage our business efficiently and may be unable to execute our business plans we have grown rapidly and will need to continue to grow our business to execute our strategy 
our total number of employees grew from nine as of december  to as of december   although the number of employees has not grown consistently 
for example  in may  we reduced the number of our employees from approximately to approximately these changes  and the growth in the number of our customers and their use of our solutions  have placed significant demands on management as well as on our administrative  operational and financial resources and controls 
any future growth or organizational changes would likely cause similar  and perhaps increased  strain on our systems and controls 
if suppliers that use our solutions do not provide timely and professional delivery of products and services to their hospital customers  hospitals may not continue using our solutions through certain of our solutions  suppliers are responsible for delivering their products and services sold to hospitals 
currently  the significant majority of these products and services are sold through marketplace novation 
if these suppliers fail to make delivery in a professional  safe and timely manner  then our solutions will not meet the expectations of hospitals  and our reputation and brand will be damaged 
in addition  deliveries that are non conforming  late or are not accompanied by information required by applicable law or regulations could expose us to liability or result in decreased adoption and use of our solutions 
we may expense the stock options that we grant to employees we may expense the stock options that we grant to employees 
it is difficult to estimate the impact that expensing stock options will have on our statement of operations as this expense is dependent upon variables that are difficult to predict  such as the number of options to be granted during a period  the price of our common stock at the time of grant  the stock price volatility  the risk free interest rate during the period and the expected average life of the option 
a slight change in any one of these variables can materially affect the amount of expense to be recorded 
our infrastructure and systems are vulnerable to natural disasters and other unexpected events  and if any of these events of a significant magnitude were to occur  the extent of our losses could exceed the amount of insurance we carry to compensate us for any losses the performance of our server and networking hardware and software infrastructure is critical to our business and reputation and our ability to process transactions  provide high quality customer service and attract and retain users of our solutions 
currently  our infrastructure and systems are located at one site in sunnyvale  california  which is an area susceptible to earthquakes 
we also have a fail over system for transaction processing located in atlanta  georgia 

table of contents our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from human error  terrorist attacks  natural disasters  power loss  telecommunications failures  break ins  sabotage  computer viruses  intentional acts of vandalism and similar events 
we do not yet have a formal disaster recovery plan  although it is our intention to formulate one 
in addition  we may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that could occur 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property  our competitors may gain access to our technology  which could harm our business we regard our intellectual property as critical to our success 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights  our business would be harmed 
we rely on trademark  copyright and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary rights 
we have applied for registration of several marks including neoforma and associated logos 
our trademark registration applications may not be approved or granted  or  if granted  may be successfully challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation 
if we lose access to third party software incorporated in our solutions  we may not be able to use our solutions we currently rely on software that we have licensed from a number of software vendors 
we will continue to rely on commercial software vendors where appropriate to speed the delivery of our solutions  while reducing the costs of custom code development and maintenance 
these licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
in addition  the licensors may not continue to support or enhance the licensed software 
in the future  we expect to license other third party technologies to enhance our solutions to meet evolving user needs or to adapt to changing technology standards 
failure to license  or the loss of any licenses of  necessary technologies could impair our ability to offer our solutions until equivalent software is identified  licensed and integrated or developed by us 
in addition  we may fail to successfully integrate licensed technology into our solutions or to adapt licensed technology to support our specific needs  which could similarly harm development and market acceptance of our solutions 
our failure to comply with applicable federal and state regulation of healthcare information could disrupt our operations  increase our operating costs and subject us to liability we are subject to federal and state laws regulating the receipt  storage and distribution of healthcare information  which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business 
laws governing the receipt  storage and distribution of health information exist at both the federal and state level 
the health insurance portability and accountability act  or hipaa  of and the implementing regulations from the department of health and human services  or hhs  mandate the use of standard transactions and identifiers  prescribed security measures and other provisions by april certain regulations of the food and drug administration  or fda  and the hospital conditions of participation for the medicare and medicaid programs require protection of and security for health information and appropriate patient access to such information 
some of the transactions using our solutions may involve surgical case kits or purchases of products for patient home delivery  these products may contain patient names and other health information subject to these laws governing the receipt  storage and distribution of health information 
it may be expensive to implement security or other measures designed to comply with the hipaa  fda and medicare confidentiality and security requirements or with any new legislation or regulations 
moreover  these and future laws may restrict or prevent us from delivering health information electronically 
if we fail to comply with these regulatory requirements  we could face a variety of civil fines and liabilities  associated costs of defense  increased costs of security  and costs of compliance with confidentiality requirements 
we may also be required to significantly curtail our use of data received  stored or distributed by our solutions 
in addition  because we represent that our solutions meet these regulatory requirements  our success will also depend on other healthcare participants complying with these regulations 

table of contents our failure to comply with applicable federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws could subject us and our gpo partners and customers to civil and criminal liability and disrupt our operations a federal law commonly known as the medicare medicaid anti kickback law  and several similar state laws  prohibit payments that are intended to induce the acquisition  arrangement for or recommendation of the acquisition of healthcare products or services 
the application and interpretation of these laws are complex and difficult to predict and could constrain our financial and marketing relationships  including but not limited to our fee arrangements with suppliers or our ability to obtain supplier company sponsorship for our solutions 
the gpo industry has been the subject of a series of critical articles published by the new york times  and a subcommittee of the united states senate judiciary committee held a hearing on april  regarding possible abuses by the gpo industry 
the new york times articles and the senate hearings focused on whether the contracting strategies and processes used by gpos unfairly disadvantage smaller suppliers and whether the fees paid by suppliers and the financial interests of the gpos and their executives in suppliers create conflicts of interest 
the senate judiciary committee has formed a panel of industry experts and developed guidelines for gpos 
we do not know what effect these articles and senate judiciary committee actions will have on our business  but because anything detrimental to the core business of our gpo partners could adversely impact our business  negative substantive findings by the senate judiciary committee  the justice department or other regulatory and enforcement bodies could potentially adversely affect our business and consequently our stock price 
because anything detrimental to the core business of our gpo and supply chain partners could adversely impact our business  negative substantive findings by any of these or future investigations could potentially adversely affect our business 
in particular  violations of these fraud and abuse laws are punishable by civil and criminal fines and penalties  which could result in restrictions on our operations  increased costs of compliance with remedies and require us to restructure our financial arrangements with our gpo and supply chain partners 
if there are changes in the political  economic or regulatory healthcare environment that affect the purchasing practice or operation of hospitals  or our supply chain partners  our business and our stock price could be adversely affected the healthcare industry is highly regulated and is subject to changing political  economic and regulatory influences 
regulation of the healthcare organizations with which we do business could impact the way in which we are able to do business with these organizations 
in addition  factors such as changes in the laws described above regarding the regulation of healthcare information and the laws and policies governing reimbursement for healthcare expenses affect the purchasing practices and operation of hospitals and gpos 
changes in regulations affecting the healthcare industry  such as any increased regulation by hhs  the justice department or the fda of healthcare information or the purchase and sale of products used by hospitals and gpos could require us to make unplanned enhancements of our solutions or result in delays or cancellations of orders or reduce demand for our solutions 
federal and state legislatures have periodically considered programs to reform or amend the us healthcare system at both the federal and state level 
these programs may contain proposals to increase governmental involvement in healthcare  lower reimbursement rates or otherwise change the environment in which healthcare industry participants  including gpos and companies such as us  operate 
securities class action lawsuits in which we have been named  relating to investment banking practices in connection with our initial public offering  may prove costly to defend  and if we are found liable  may expose us to financial liability greater than we are able to sustain in july  we were named as a defendant in two securities class action lawsuits filed in federal court in the southern district of new york relating to our ipo by stockholders who purchased our common stock during the period from january   to december  since that time  additional lawsuits have been filed asserting federal securities claims arising from our ipo 
the lawsuits also name certain of the underwriters  merrill lynch  pierce  fenner smith  bear stearns and fleet boston robertson stephens  as defendants 
the lawsuits contain substantially identical allegations  which are that the prospectus and the registration statement for the ipo failed to disclose that the underwriters solicited and received excessive commissions from investors  and that some investors in the ipo agreed to buy more shares of our common stock in the secondary market  at 
table of contents predetermined prices  in a scheme to artificially inflate the price of our common stock 
although we believe that the claims made against us in these suits are without merit  they could be time consuming  costly to defend and require us to pay significant damages 
regulation of the internet is unsettled  and future regulations could inhibit the growth of e commerce and limit the market for our solutions a number of legislative and regulatory proposals under consideration by federal  state  local and foreign governmental organizations may lead to laws or regulations concerning various aspects of the internet  such as user privacy  taxation of goods and services provided over the internet and the pricing  content and quality of services 
legislation could dampen the growth in internet usage and decrease or limit its acceptance as a communications and commercial medium 
if enacted  these laws and regulations could limit the market for our solutions 
in addition  existing laws could be applied to the internet  including consumer privacy laws 
legislation or application of existing laws could expose companies involved in e commerce to increased liability  which could limit the growth of e commerce 
we may be subject to intellectual property claims and if we were to subsequently lose our intellectual property rights  we could be unable to operate our current business we may from time to time be subject to claims of infringement of other parties proprietary rights or claims that our own trademarks  patents or other intellectual property rights are invalid 
any claims regarding our intellectual property  with or without merit  could be time consuming and costly to defend  divert management attention and resources or require us to pay significant damages 
license agreements may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
in addition  there has been an increase in the number of patent applications related to the use of the internet to perform business processes 
enforcement of intellectual property rights in the internet sector will become a greater source of risk as the number of business process patents increases 
the loss of access to any key intellectual property right  including use of the neoforma brand name  could result in our inability to operate our current business 
our stock price and those of other technology companies have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  and  accordingly  our stock price may continue to be volatile  which could negatively affect your investment the trading price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly since our initial public offering in january and is significantly below the original offering price 
an active public market for our common stock may not be sustained in the future 
many factors could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate  including variations in our quarterly operating results  announcements of new accounting pronouncements or legal rules or regulations  announcements of technological innovations by us or by our competitors  introductions of new services by us or by our competitors  departure of key personnel  the gain or loss of significant strategic relationships or customers  changes in the estimates of our operating performance or changes in recommendations by securities analysts  changes in the number of research analysts that follow our company  and market conditions in our industry and the economy as a whole  especially in light of the initiation by the united states of armed conflict with iraq 

table of contents in addition  stocks of technology companies have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated or disproportionate to these companies operating performance 
public announcements by companies in our industry concerning  among other things  their performance  accounting practices or legal problems could cause fluctuations in the market for stocks of these companies 
these fluctuations could lower the market price of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we invest in high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
as stated in our investment policy  we seek to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in safe and high credit quality securities and by reviewing our portfolio monthly to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer  guarantor or depository 
our portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
because our investments mature within one year  a hypothetical change in interest rate of would not have a significant effect on the value of our investments and would reduce interest income by approximately  the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by date of maturity for our investment portfolio in thousands fiscal years cash equivalents and short term investments fixed rate short term investments average interest rate
