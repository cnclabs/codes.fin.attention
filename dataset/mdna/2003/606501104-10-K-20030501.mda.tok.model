item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview our revenues are directly related to the level of worldwide oil and gas exploration activities and the profitability and cash flows of oil and gas companies and seismic contractors  which in turn are affected by expectations regarding the supply and demand for oil and natural gas  energy prices and finding and development costs 
we lease and sell seismic data acquisition equipment primarily to seismic data acquisition companies and oil and gas companies conducting land and transition zone seismic surveys worldwide 
we provide short term leasing of seismic equipment to meet a customer s requirements and offer maintenance and support during the lease term 
the majority of all leases at january  were for a term of one year or less 
seismic equipment held for lease is carried at cost  net of accumulated depreciation 
through our wholly owned subsidiary  dsi  we provide front end services to seismic data acquisition contractors 
such services typically include seismic survey program design  quality control  permit acquisition  geographical surveying and shot hole drilling 
for the years ended january   and  revenues from foreign customers totaled million  million and million  respectively 
the majority of our transactions with foreign customers are denominated in united states and canadian dollars 
seasonality historically  seismic equipment leasing has been susceptible to weather patterns in certain geographic regions 
there is some seasonality to our expected lease revenues  especially from customers operating in canada  where a significant percentage of seismic survey activity occurs in the winter months  from november through march 
during the months in which the weather is warmer  certain areas are not accessible to trucks  earth vibrators and other equipment because of the unstable terrain 
this seasonal leasing activity by our canadian customers has historically resulted in increased lease revenues in our first and fourth fiscal quarters 
results of operations we created our front end services segment in january upon the formation of dsi 
as fiscal is the first year of operations for this segment  there are no comparable prior year results 
consolidated revenues for fiscal were million  reflecting an million  or  decline from fiscal revenues of million 
during fiscal  leasing revenues decreased primarily due to the business decline of three of our customers in fiscal  partially offset by the inclusion of the results of our front end services segment 
front end services revenues for fiscal were approximately million 
additionally  fiscal revenues include the results of our australian subsidiary  sap  which was purchased in december sap s revenues for fiscal were approximately 
million 
foreign currency translation rates had the effect of decreasing fiscal revenues by approximately  from fiscal levels 
fiscal revenues were million  reflecting a million  or  increase over fiscal revenues of million 
during fiscal  we executed several high dollar lease contracts with a customer in south america that attributed to our increase in revenues for the year 
foreign currency translation rates had the effect of decreasing fiscal revenues by approximately  from fiscal levels 
included in fiscal revenues is commission income of million  compared to only  in fiscal this commission income was earned by mitcham canada pursuant to the sercel sales agreement  was based on direct sales by sercel to various customers and was recognized when sercel paid the applicable commission to us 
fiscal revenues were million  which represented a million  or increase over fiscal revenues of million 
during fiscal  we experienced a greater demand for equipment leasing from our customers  primarily in response to the higher level of commodity prices 
foreign currency translation rates had the effect of decreasing fiscal revenues by approximately  from fiscal levels 
seismic equipment sales for fiscal were million as compared to million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
cost of sales for the fiscal years ended january   and was million  million and million  respectively 
foreign currency translation rates had the effect of decreasing cost of goods sold for fiscal years  and by   and  respectively 
gross margins on equipment sales were  and for fiscal years  and  respectively 
gross margins on equipment sales may vary significantly between periods due to the mix of newly added seismic equipment to the lease pool versus older  more depreciated seismic equipment being sold 
during fiscal  we recorded depreciation expense in the amount of million 
this amount reflects a decrease of 
million  or  from the fiscal amount 
foreign currency translation rates had the effect of decreasing depreciation expense for fiscal by  from the fiscal amount 
in fiscal  we recorded depreciation expense in the amount of million  which reflected a million  or  increase above the fiscal amount 
foreign currency translation rates had the effect of decreasing depreciation expense for fiscal by  from the fiscal amount 
depreciation expense for fiscal was approximately million  representing an increase of million  or  above the fiscal amount 
foreign currency translation rates had the effect of decreasing depreciation expense for fiscal by  from the fiscal amount 
the decrease in fiscal depreciation expense is largely due to the fact that certain equipment reached the end of its depreciable life during the year  coupled with the sales of assets with remaining depreciable life 
the increase in depreciation expense during fiscal is primarily a result of our replacement of older  fully depreciated seismic equipment with new  state of the art technology 
the fiscal increase in depreciation expense is a result of our adding million  on a cost basis  to the seismic equipment lease pool during the fiscal year 
for fiscal  the seismic segment s direct costs of seismic leasing totaled million  representing a decrease of 
million from the fiscal amount of million 
this decrease is attributable to the significant decrease in leasing activity during the fiscal year 
specifically  the decrease is mainly attributable to decreases in freight  equipment repairs and leased equipment expenses of   and  respectively 
front end services direct costs totaled million for fiscal as this segment is labor intensive  the primary expenses are wage related expenses 
additionally  front end services direct costs also include explosives and related drilling materials as well as significant equipment repairs and maintenance expenses 
for fiscal  our direct costs of seismic leasing totaled approximately million  for an increase of  over the fiscal amount 
this increase is a result of the significant increase in equipment leasing activity during the year 
the increase is attributable to increases in freight and equipment repairs of  and  respectively  partially offset by a decrease in leased equipment expenses of  fiscal direct costs were million  an increase of approximately  from fiscal amounts  reflecting the significant increase in leasing activities during fiscal direct costs typically increase with leasing revenues  as the two main components of direct costs are freight and equipment repairs 
for the fiscal year ended january   our general and administrative expenses totaled million  or million above those of fiscal approximately million of the increase is due to the inclusion of dsi and 
million is due to the inclusion of sap in fiscal the remaining increase is due to higher payroll related expenses and insurance  partially offset by a decrease in state franchise tax expense 
for the fiscal year ended january   our general and administrative expenses totaled approximately million  or 
million above those of fiscal this increase is primarily due to an increase in insurance  professional fees and debt acquisition costs  partially offset by a decrease in travel  rent and customer relation expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased approximately million in fiscal as compared to fiscal expense of million 
the fiscal increase in general and administrative expenses is due to an increase in rent and storage fees associated with the new facility in calgary  as well as an increase in insurance  customer relations  travel and compensation expenses partially offset by a decrease in professional fees and convention and advertising expenses 
additionally  during fiscal  we incurred personnel and related costs associated with international marketing efforts 
during fiscal  we recorded a non cash net benefit for doubtful accounts in the amount of million 
of this amount  approximately million represents recoveries of receivables written off in the prior fiscal year in the form of seismic equipment that we accepted as a settlement related to a former customer which ceased operations last year 
the remaining 
million benefit resulted from our collecting an outstanding note receivable that had been fully reserved in prior fiscal years due to the uncertainty of collection 
once the funds were collected  we reduced our allowance for doubtful accounts and recorded the net benefit 
our provision for doubtful accounts in fiscal was approximately million  for a substantial increase over the fiscal amount of  as of january   we had reserved or written off approximately million in trade and note receivables related to three customers who advised us they were ceasing operations and did not have the resources to pay their outstanding obligations to us 
during fiscal  our provision for doubtful accounts was  reflecting a decrease of  from fiscal the decrease in fiscal is attributable to our improvement in our receivables aging and our collecting approximately  of receivables previously written off 
during fiscal  we wrote off approximately  of receivables deemed uncollectible 
at january  and  we had past due trade accounts and note receivables in the approximate amount of 
million and million  respectively 
as of january  and  our allowance for doubtful accounts and notes receivable amounted to 
million and million  respectively 
for fiscal  we recorded a net loss in the amount of million  as compared to the fiscal net loss of million 
contributing to the current year s net loss were the results of dsi  which was in its first year as a start up business  partially offset by the approximate million income tax benefit recorded during the year 
the primary factors behind the fiscal net loss were the bad debt provision and valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets  as discussed more fully in the notes to the financial statements 
the net loss for fiscal was million  which included an income tax benefit of approximately million 
liquidity and capital resources as of january   we had net working capital of approximately million as compared to net working capital of 
million at january  historically  our principal liquidity requirements and uses of cash have been for capital expenditures and working capital and principal sources of cash have been cash flows from operations and issuances of equity securities 
net cash used in operating activities for the year ended january  was million  as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million and million for the years ended january  and  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended january  was 
million  compared to net cash used in financing activities for the year ended january  of million and net cash provided by financing of million for fiscal year during fiscal and  we liquidated temporary investments in marketable securities of approximately million and million  respectively  to fund a portion of our capital expenditure program 
the temporary investments were originally made with surplus cash generated in prior fiscal years which was invested in marketable securities until such time as the funds were needed 
during fiscal  we paid million to settle a securities class action lawsuit using funds generated from our operations 
the balance of the settlement was paid by our insurance carrier  as more fully discussed in note on october   we were notified that sercel was terminating the sercel sales agreement effective january  total commissions earned under this agreement in the  and fiscal years were  only  of which was earned in the fiscal year 
its cancellation is not expected to have significant effect on our results of operations and liquidity 
we committed to purchase million of land data acquisition equipment by december  and million of land data acquisition equipment by december  we expect that cash on hand and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet these commitments 
at january   we had trade accounts and notes receivable of 
million that were more than days past due  as compared to million at january  during fiscal  we wrote off approximately 
million of accounts and notes receivable that were more than days past due 
as of january   our allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately 
million  which management believes is sufficient to cover any losses in our trade accounts receivable and notes receivable 
in certain instances when customers have been unable to repay their open accounts receivable balances  we have agreed to a structured repayment program using an interest bearing promissory note 
in these cases  we provide a reserve for doubtful accounts against the balance 
due to the uncertainty of collection  we do not recognize the interest earned until the entire principal balance has been collected 
in most cases where we have a chronic collection problem with a particular customer  future business is done on a prepayment basis or if additional credit is extended  revenues are not recognized until collected 
although the extension of repayment terms on open accounts receivables temporarily reduces our cash flow from operations  we believe that this practice is necessary in light of seismic industry conditions and that it has not adversely affected our ability to conduct routine business 
additionally  we occasionally offer extended payment terms on equipment sales transactions 
these terms are generally less than one year in duration 
unless there is a question as to collectibility  the sales revenue and cost of goods sold is recognized at the inception of the transaction 
on november   we closed an million term loan with first victoria national bank 
the loan amortized over months and bore interest at the rate of prime plus one half percent  adjusted daily 
the first three monthly payments were interest only  with the remaining monthly payments being interest and principal in the approximate amount of  in february  we renegotiated our term loan and borrowed an additional million 
beginning in march  the monthly payments of principal and interest are approximately  the loan is collateralized by certain lease pool equipment 
additionally  during fiscal we borrowed  under a separate loan agreement in connection with our acquisition of assets related to the formation of dsi 
this term loan matured in december  bore interest at the rate of prime minus one percent  and required quarterly repayments in the approximate amount of  capital expenditures for the fiscal year totaled approximately million as compared to capital expenditures of million for fiscal the decline in our fiscal capital expenditures from prior years is a reflection of a continuing decline in seismic data acquisition activity 
unlike in prior years when the majority of equipment we purchased was based on anticipated demand for our services  the majority of our capital expenditures for the fiscal year was made to fulfill a specific lease contract or was purchased for ultimate resale to a specific customer 
during fiscal  we repurchased  shares of our common stock for an aggregate cost of  or an average cost of per share 
at the present time  we believe that cash on hand and cash provided by future operations will be sufficient to fund our anticipated capital and liquidity needs over the next twelve months 
however  should demand warrant  we may pursue additional borrowings to fund capital expenditures 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period 
significant estimates made by us in the accompanying consolidated financial statements relate to reserves for accounts receivable collectibility and useful lives of our lease pool assets and their valuation 
critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial position and results of operation as well as require management s subjective judgment 
below is a brief discussion of our critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition we recognize lease revenue ratably over the term of the lease and recognize sales revenue at the inception of the transaction unless there is a question as to its collectibility 
commission income is recognized once it has been paid to us 
interest income related to the financing of delinquent customer receivables is not recognized until the entire principal balance has been collected 
the front end services segment recognizes income at the time services are provided 
allowance for doubtful accounts provisions to the allowance for doubtful accounts are made periodically as conditions warrant based on the expected collectibility of all such receivables 
in certain instances when customers have been unable to repay their open accounts receivable balances  we have agreed to a structured repayment program using an interest bearing promissory note 
in these cases  we provide a reserve for doubtful accounts against the balance 
long lived asset impairment we review our long lived lease pool assets for impairment at each reporting date 
if our assessment of the carrying amount of such assets exceeds the fair market value in accordance with the applicable accounting regulations  an impairment charge is recorded 
no such charge has been recorded for the periods presented 
income taxes we account for our taxes under the liability method  whereby we recognize  on a current and long term basis  deferred tax assets and liabilities which represent differences between the financial and income tax reporting bases of our assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance is established when uncertainty exists as to the ultimate realization of net deferred tax assets 
as of january  and  we have recorded a net deferred tax asset of million and million  respectively 
as we believe it is not assured that these net deferred tax assets will be realized  we have provided valuation allowances of million and million at january  and  respectively 
we periodically reevaluate these estimates and assumptions as circumstances change 
such factors may significantly impact our results of operations from period to period 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we operate internationally  giving rise to exposure to market risks from changes in foreign exchange rates to the extent that transactions are not denominated in us dollars 
we typically denominate the majority of our lease and sales contracts in us and canadian dollars to mitigate the exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies
