new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and requires that the liabilities associated with these costs be recorded at their fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred 
sfas no 
is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  the company believes that the impact of sfas no 
will not be material 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin elaborates the disclosure requirements for most guarantees  including standby letters of credit  and clarifies that companies recognize an initial liability for the fair value of the obligations assumed 
the guidance on recognition applies to guarantees issued or modified after december  and the guidance on disclosure is effective for reporting periods ending after december  the company believes that the impact of fin will not be material 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
this interpretation applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january  it applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june   to variable interest entities created prior to february  through its investments and other segment  the company has investments in a number of real estate operations  along with the company s wholly owned real estate  primarily for the purpose of providing facilities for lease to the company s other business segments and its affiliates 
as described liquidity and capital resources  the company has outstanding commitments to certain of these operations  as well as loans to and other potential variable interests in these entities 
the company is evaluating whether these real estate operations are variable interest entities as defined in fin and whether fin otherwise impacts the company s historical accounting for these relationships 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  amending sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
requires more prominent disclosures regarding the pro forma effects of using the fair value method of accounting and requires that the disclosures be included in interim as well as annual financial statements  effective for fiscal years ending after december  the estimated impact of these new accounting standards reflects the company s current views 
there may be material differences between these estimates and the actual impact of these standards 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  software capitalization and amortization  depreciation of fixed assets  valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill  and accounting for investments 
revenue recognition the company derives over of its revenues as a result of providing processing and services under contracts 
the majority of the amount is billed on a monthly basis generally with thirty day collection terms 
revenues are recognized for monthly processing and services upon completion of the services 
in the event a portion of the company s revenues are due six months or more from the invoice date  the company accounts for the revenue as not being fixed and determinable 
in these cases  the revenue is recognized as it becomes due 
the company s standard business practice is to bill monthly for development  consulting and training services on a time and material basis 
there are exceptions  whereby certain commercial arrangements require that a fixed fee arrangement for development and consulting services 
for fixed fee arrangements  the company recognizes revenue on a percentage of completion basis 
the company derives less than of its revenues from licensing products 
the company licenses its asset management products and its awd product generally to non mutual fund customers and international customers and its intelecable and affinity products to international customers 
software license revenues are recognized at the time the contract is signed  the software is delivered and no future software obligations exist 
deferral of software license revenue billed results from delayed payment provisions  disproportionate discounts between the license and other services or the inability to unbundle certain services 
the company recognizes revenues for maintenance services ratably over the contract term  after collectibility has been assured 
for all revenues  the company assesses collection based on a variety of factors  including past collection history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
the company does not request collateral from its customers 
if it is determined that collection of revenues is not reasonably assured  revenue is deferred and is recognized at the time it becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
allowances for billing adjustments are determined as revenues are recognized and are recorded as reductions in revenues 
doubtful account expense for the company is immaterial 
software capitalization and amortization the company makes substantial investments in software to enhance the functionality and facilitate the delivery of its processing and services as well as its sale of licensed products 
purchased software is recorded at cost and is amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated economic lives of three to five years 
the company also develops a large portion of its software internally 
the company is required to capitalize software development costs under two separate accounting pronouncements 
the first  sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  effective january   applies to software that will be sold or delivered to third parties and requires capitalization of research and development costs after technological feasibility has been established and management is committed to funding the project 
the second pronouncement  statement of position sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  effective january   requires capitalization of certain development costs after the design has been approved and management is committed to funding the project 
the capitalized software development costs are generally amortized on a straight line basis  based on an estimated economic life  which is dependent on the nature of the project 
excluding fairway  the company has assigned lives of three to five years for capitalized software development 
the company assigned an estimated economic life of ten years for capitalized fairway development costs  due to management s estimate of when the base functionality will be replaced through enhancements or upgrades 
significant management judgment is required in determining what projects and costs associated with software development will be capitalized and in assigning estimated economic lives to the completed projects 
management specifically analyzes software development projects and analyzes the percentage of completion as compared to the initial plan and subsequent forecasts  milestones achieved and the commitment to continue funding the projects 
significant changes in any of these items may result in discontinuing capitalization of development costs as well as immediately expensing previously capitalized costs 
depreciation of fixed assets the company s philosophy on personal property  specifically data processing equipment  is to own the property as opposed to leasing it where practicable 
the company believes this approach provides it better flexibility of disposing or redeploying the asset as it nears the completion of its economic life 
the company depreciates data processing equipment using accelerated depreciation methods over the following lives non mainframe equipment three years  mainframe central processing unit four years  and mainframe direct access storage devices and tape devices five years 
the company depreciates furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements over estimated economic lives of three to ten years and generally uses accelerated depreciation methods for domestic assets and straight line depreciation for international assets 
management judgment is required in assigning economic lives to fixed assets 
management specifically analyzes fixed asset additions  remaining net book values and gain loss upon disposition of fixed assets to determine the appropriateness of assigned economic lives 
significant changes in any of these items may result in changes in the economic life assigned and the resulting depreciation expense 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill the company assesses at least annually the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill and enterprise level goodwill or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that are considered important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of the company s use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when it is determined that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill and enterprise level goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  the company measures any impairment based on gross cash flows 
in  sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  became effective and  as a result  the company and its unconsolidated affiliates ceased amortizing goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives and  instead  will test for impairment annually 
the company s initial impairment test upon adoption of sfas no 
and annual impairment test indicated that there were no impairments 
the fair value of the reporting units was estimated using the expected present value of future cash flows 
accounting for investments the company has two significant types of investments investments in available for sale securities  which is comprised principally from investments in state street and computer sciences corporation  and investments in unconsolidated affiliates  which is comprised principally of bfds  ifds uk  ifds canada  argus  wall street access and certain real estate joint ventures 
the company accounts for investments in corporations  for which it owns less than and does not have significant influence  in accordance with sfas no 
under sfas no 
 the company is required to designate its equity investments as trading or available for sale 
at december   the company had approximately million of available for sale securities 
available for sale securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and recorded net of deferred taxes directly to stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income 
at december   the company s available for sale securities had gross unrealized holding gains of million and gross unrealized holding losses of million 
the impact of a change in fair value of these investments would be approximately million to comprehensive income 
the company records an investment impairment charge for an investment with a gross unrealized holding loss resulting from a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
the equity method of accounting is used for investments in corporations in which the company or its subsidiaries have at least a voting interest and significant influence but do not control and for all investments in partnerships and similar interests in which the company does not control 
the company classifies these investments as unconsolidated affiliates 
under the equity method  the company recognizes  on an equity basis  income or losses from its pro rata share of these unconsolidated affiliates net income or loss  which changes the carrying value of the investment of the unconsolidated affiliate 
in certain cases  pro rata losses are recognized only to the extent of the company s investment and advances to the unconsolidated affiliate 
the company s carrying value of unconsolidated affiliates approximates its pro rata share of the unconsolidated affiliates net tangible assets 
although the company does not expect that it will need to record an impairment charge for its investments in unconsolidated affiliates  future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of unconsolidated affiliates could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the unconsolidated affiliate investment that may not be reflected in the investment s carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future
