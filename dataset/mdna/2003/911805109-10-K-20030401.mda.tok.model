item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is management s discussion and analysis of significant factors which have affected our liquidity  capital resources and results of operations during the periods included in the accompanying financial statements 
the discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
due to uncertainties in our business  actual results may differ materially from the discussion below 
during its regular meeting on december   the board of directors unanimously voted to change the company s year end from may to december beginning december  this decision was made primarily as a result of the company expanding activities in the coalbed methane natural gas industry 
many business relationships in the natural gas industry are based upon partnerships which by statute have december year ends 
changing the company s year end to december will simplify accounting and reporting responsibilities of the company 
additionally  many indexes and valuations in the natural gas industry are calculated as of december as a result of the decision to change the year end to december  the company has presented balance sheets as of december   may  and may   along with statements of operations and statements of cash flows for the seven months ended december  and the fiscal years ended may   and additionally  footnote n to the consolidated financial statements presents transitional period comparative data for the seven month periods ended december  and critical accounting policies oil and gas producing activities we follow the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties 
accordingly  all costs associated with acquisition  exploration  and development of oil and gas reserves  including directly related overhead costs  are capitalized 
all capitalized costs of oil and gas properties subject to amortization and the estimated future costs to develop proved reserves  are amortized on the unit of production method using estimates of proved reserves 
investments in unproved properties and major exploration and development projects are not amortized until proved reserves associated with the projects can be determined 
unproved properties are assessed periodically to ascertain whether impairment has occurred 
such assessments could cause the company to reduce the carrying values of the properties 
in addition  the capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test  which basically limits such costs to the aggregate of the estimated present value  discounted at a percent interest rate of future net revenues from proved reserves  based on current economic and operating conditions  plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties 
our discounted present value of our proved natural gas reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation and requires many subjective judgments 
estimates of reserves are forecasts based on engineering and geological analyses 
different reserve engineers may reach different conclusions as to estimated quantities of natural gas reserves based on the same information 
our reserve estimates are prepared by independent consultants 
the passage of time provides more qualitative information regarding reserve estimates  and revisions are made to prior estimates based on updated information 
however  there can be no assurance that more significant revisions will not be necessary in the future 
significant downward revisions could result in a full cost write down 
in addition to the impact on calculation of the ceiling test  estimates of proved reserves are also a major component of the calculation of depletion 
while the quantities of proved reserves require substantial judgment  the associated price of natural gas reserves that are included in the discounted present value of our reserves are objectively determined 
the ceiling calculation requires prices and costs in effect as of the last day of the accounting period are generally held constant for the life of the properties 
as a result  the present value is not necessarily an indication of the fair value of the reserves 
natural gas prices have historically been volatile and the prevailing prices at any given time may not reflect our company s or the industry s forecast of future prices 
reclamation liabilities the company s policy is to accrue the liability for future reclamation costs of its mineral properties based on the current estimate of the future reclamation costs as determined by internal and external experts 
recent accounting pronouncements sfas no 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations 
the statement requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for legal obligations associated with the retirement of obligations of tangible long lived assets in the period in which it is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  the entity increases the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
accretion of the liability is recognized each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement 
the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   with earlier application encouraged 
the company is evaluating the impact of sfas no 
and has implemented the pronouncement effective january  sfas no 
in december  the company adopted the supplemental disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amended sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
the company continues to record compensation related to employee stock options based on the intrinsic value method per apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas no 
encourages companies to voluntarily elect to record the compensation based on market value either prospectively  as defined in sfas no 
 or retroactively or in a modified prospective method 
among other things  the company is concerned about the reasonableness of the values of its stock options determined using the black scholes method 
therefore  the company has delayed the potential transition to recording stock compensation based on fair market value until there is more clarity regarding the measurement of stock option values 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin expands the information disclosures required by guarantors for obligations under certain types of guarantees 
it also requires initial recognition at fair value of a liability for such guarantees 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   irrespective of the guarantor s fiscal year end 
the disclosure requirements in the interpretation are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  the company believes that the adoption of this statements will not have a material impact on its financial condition or results of operation 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin  which addresses consolidation by business enterprises where equity investors do not bear the residual economic risks and rewards 
these entities have been commonly referred to as special purpose entities 
companies are required to apply the provision of fin prospectively for all variable interest entities created after january  for public companies  all interest acquired before february  must follow the new rules in accounting periods beginning after june  the company is currently evaluating the impact fin is expected to have on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company has reviewed other current outstanding statements from the financial accounting standards board and does not believe that any of those statements will have a material adverse affect on the financial statements of the company when adopted 
liquidity and capital resources during the seven months ended december   our cash position decreased by  to  from a cash position of  at may   our previous year end 
this reduction of cash was as a result of  being consumed in operations during the seven months ended december  this was offset by cash which was provided from investing and financing activities during the same period of  and  respectively 
operations during the seven months ended december  resulted in a loss of  the major non cash components of this loss were depreciation and amortization of  amortization of debt discounts of  loss on the sale of assets of  and non cash compensation of  these non cash expenses along with the net decrease in current assets and liabilities of  resulted in net cash consumed by operations of  operations during the seven months ended december  consisted primarily of administrative costs associated with the expansion of the rmg coalbed methane gas business  holding costs associated with mineral properties that are in shut down status and the management of the plateau properties in southern utah 
through december   the coalbed methane properties were being developed and produced very little revenue 
investment activities provided cash of  primarily as a result of the sale of a portion of the sgmc raw land that was no longer needed for the operations of its mineral property  sale of certain business development real estate in wyoming and the sale of various pieces of equipment that are no longer needed 
these activities provided  in cash 
additionally  rmg received  from ccbm as principal payments on the  promissory note for the purchase of a interest in certain of the rmg properties 
as these payments are received  they reduce rmg s cost basis in its full cost pool of coalbed methane properties 
investing activities also consumed cash through the purchase and exploration of coalbed methane properties of  and the purchase of various pieces of equipment and the replacement of major component parts of others  for  financing activities during the seven months ended december   provided  as a result of an increase in long term debt of  which was offset by payments on long term debt and the line of credit of  and  respectively 
long term debt increased as a result of the purchase and long term maintenance on pieces of equipment of  financing of liability insurance premiums of  and new convertible debt from a third party company in the amount of  this new convertible debt was entered into in november the convertible debt is due in two years and accrues interest at per annum payable quarterly 
at the option of the holder of the debt  the note can be fully paid by the issuance of either  shares of the company s common stock or  shares of rmg common stock 
the company and rmg also issued warrants to purchase  shares of their common stock at and per share  respectively 
a discount of  was recorded against the debt as a result of the beneficial conversion feature of the debt 
the amortization of this discount along with a discount taken on previously entered into convertible debt  reduced the overall increase in long term debt by  capital resources general the primary sources of our capital resources are cash on hand  collection of receivables  receipt of monthly payments from ccbm for the purchase of an interest in rmg s coalbed methane properties  ccbm funding of drilling and development programs  production from rmg s coalbed methane properties  sale of excess mine  construction and drilling equipment  sale of real estate properties which are no longer needed in the core business of the company  sale of mineral properties  the line of credit with a commercial bank  equity financing of the company s subsidiaries  and the final determination of the sheep mountain partners smp arbitration litigation 
we will also continue to receive revenues from our motel and real estate operations in southern utah 
rmg coalbed methane drilling and development capital requirements will be satisfied for the majority of from the ccbm work commitment of which there is  remaining as of december  approximately one half of this amount   will be paid by ccbm on behalf of rmg for its obligations for drilling and property development of coalbed methane properties 
there is also a balance of  due from ccbm under its purchase agreement 
ccbm pays  per month plus interest until november at which time a balloon payment of  is due on this promissory note 
ccbm s interest in rmg s coalbed methane properties is pledged as security for the note to rmg 
after ccbm has paid  of the principal amount of the promissory note  rmg will release of the undivided interest in the coalbed methane properties purchased by ccbm  another when  of the principal is paid  and the balance of the total undivided interest when all of the principal amount of  of the purchase price has been paid 
ccbm may elect at any time to discontinue making the monthly payments subject to not obtaining a full undivided interest in the properties 
under the ccbm agreement  ccbm also agreed to use its best efforts to obtain financing to raise no less than million to be used by rmg to acquire more coalbed methane properties 
ccbm has not been successful in raising these funds within the terms of the agreement due to market conditions for coalbed methane gas 
rmg has verbally extended the time for ccbm to raise the funds to june  rmg and ccbm continue to pursue various sources of financing to expand the coalbed methane business 
shut down mining properties the company has shut down it mines and discontinued its mining and construction operations 
as a result the company has surplus equipment and buildings from these operations 
to assist in financing the holding costs of the sgmc properties which are shut down  the company developed a mine tour business 
after operating the mine tour business for approximately one year  it was determined to lease the tour business to a third party 
proceeds under the lease agreement partially defray the holding costs of the mine properties 
the company is currently discussing the potential of either a sale of the properties to an industry partner or a possible joint venture agreement to operate the properties 
we have been involved in litigation with nukem  inc involving smp for the past twelve years 
the us district court of colorado has appointed a special master to determine the value of the purchase rights  the pounds of uranium and the profits under certain contracts nukem entered into with three cis republics  which contracts have been impressed in a constructive trust in favor of smp 
the special master is currently performing the accounting 
the federal court has ordered that the accounting be completed and filed with the court by april  with a further status hearing to be held on april  the ultimate outcome of this litigation cannot be determined but management of the company believes that it will be beneficial to the company 
real estate the company continues to market home and mobile home lots in southern utah 
these fully developed properties are not important to the operations of the company 
the lots were a portion of the assets that the company acquired when it purchased the shootaring uranium mill and ticaboo townsite 
the company has also listed the commercial operations at ticaboo for sale 
it is the intention of management of the company to sell this commercial property 
the company is also selling components of the shootaring mill 
lines of credit we currently have a  line of credit with a commercial bank 
as of december  the full amount of the line of credit was available to the company 
this line of credit is up for renewal in june we also have a  credit facility through our subsidiary plateau resources 
this line of credit is for the development of the ticaboo townsite in southern utah 
plateau has drawn down the entire amount of this financing facility which is repayable over years 
all payments on this debt is current as of december  we believe that these cash resources will be sufficient to sustain operations during capital requirements the primary capital requirements during are expected to be exploration and development of coalbed methane properties  the cost of maintaining our uranium and gold properties that are shut down and general and administrative costs 
exploration of coalbed methane properties the majority of the exploration costs associated with the coalbed methane properties of rmg will be funded by ccbm from the remaining balance of  under the million work commitment 
if properties are drilled that are owned only or less by rmg  we may be required to fund the drilling costs for the interest ownership of the remaining non participating parties 
should we be required to fund any non participating entities portion of the exploration programs  there is a back in provision on each property which gives rmg a disproportionate amount of the production revenues until our cost and additional amounts are recovered before the non participating parties begin to receive production funds 
during  it is projected that various drilling  completion and gathering programs will be completed on rmg properties 
in addition  it is the intent of the management of the company and rmg to purchase additional exploratory production acreage 
all of these programs are subject to financing and will be limited if financing is not available through ccbm or through financing arranged by rmg and the company 
due to the uncertainty of raising the necessary capital to complete these projects  it is not possible to project what if any capital requirements the company and rmg will be required to fund during however  a total of  gross rental fees are due to lessors on cbm leases during  of which rmg is responsible for  these fees will have to be paid to keep the acreage positions 
holding costs of shut down mineral properties the holding costs associated with the uranium mineral properties formerly owned by sheep mountain partners smp  are approximately  per month 
we continue to implement cost cutting measures to reduce the holding costs 
we have begun the process of reclamation on certain of these mine properties and will continue to do work during it is estimated that  in reclamation work will be completed on the smp properties during plateau owns the ticaboo townsite  which includes a motel  convenience store  boat storage  restaurant and lounge 
the operation and lease of these facilities cover their operating costs and return a profit to the company 
additionally  plateau owns and maintains the tony m uranium property and shootaring canyon uranium mill 
the uranium property and mill are both shut down and the holding cost of these properties is minimal 
we have one employee at the sgmc properties to preserve the core assets and properties 
in addition to the cost of this employee  we have lease payments that are due to various land owners 
the net average monthly cash cost of the sutter properties is expected to be  during debt payments debt to non related parties at december  was  as compared with  and  at may  and may   respectively 
the increase in debt to non related parties of  consists of debt incurred to finance annual insurance premiums of  purchase of equipment of  and convertible debt in the amount of  from an independent company 
this debt was discounted by  for detached warrants and a beneficial conversion provision  which will be amortized over the life of the debt 
the payment requirements on long term debt during is  of interest on convertible loans and principal payments of  see note g to the financial statements for more detail at december   the company had not borrowed any money from its available  line of credit with a commercial bank 
reclamation costs the reclamation obligations are long term and are either bonded through the use of cash bonds or the pledge of assets 
it is anticipated that  of reclamation work will be performed on the smp properties during there is no reclamation requirement on the sgmc properties during the company may begin reclamation work at the shootaring uranium mill in southern utah 
if such projects are initiated management of the company will seek to have the projects funded through the cash bonds that have been posted for that purpose 
at december  the company had million in cash deposit accounts for the funding of the reclamation of the shootaring mill 
as the coalbed methane properties are just coming into production there is no reclamation cost anticipated during if an exploratory well were to be abandoned  it is anticipated that the reclamation cost for the well would range from  to  rmg will only be obligated to the extent of its working interest in such reclamation costs 
federal income tax issues the internal revenue service irs has audited our books and records through the fiscal years ended may  there were no changes in the amount of taxes due as a result of these audits and the audits are closed 
results of operations seven months ended december  compared to the seven months ended december  revenues during the seven months ended december   the company recognized  in revenues as compared to  in revenues during the seven months ended december  this decrease of  in revenues is primarly as a result of decreased revenues from motel  real estate and airport operations of  and decreased management fees of  these decreases in revenues was offset by revenues from the production of coalbed methane gas during the seven months ended december  of  while no revenues from coalbed methane produciton were recognized during the same period of the previous year 
revenues from motel  real estate and airport operations decreased due primarly as a result of decreased tourist travel to the company s southern utah operations near lake powell 
this decrease in tourist business is directly related to the fear of terrorist activity which has been felt in the united states since the attack on the world trade centers and the lack of moisture in utah which has caused lake powell to be at a very low level for water sports and recreation 
through the purchase of the bobcat field  rmg began selling coalbed methane gas during the seven months ended december  as anticipated  production from these newly developed wells was lower than it will be in the future 
additionally the market price for natural gas was very low during the summer and fall months of these reasons along with high start up and operating costs of  resulted in a loss from operations for coalbed methane of  management believes with increased production volumes  reduced ongoing operating costs and increased market prices that the coalbed methane properties will show profits and cash flows during costs and expenses costs and expenses during the seven months ended december were  as compared to costs and expenses of  during the seven months ended december  this reduction of  was as a result of reduced motel operating costs of  as a result of the reduced amount of tourists at the company s operations in southern utah as discussed above and a reduction of  in the holding costs of shut down mineral properties due to an ongoing cost cutting program 
these reductions in operating costs were offset primarly by the operating costs associated with coalbed methane 
other income and expenses during the seven months ended december  the company recognized a loss on the sale of assets of  while it recognized a gain on the sale of assets during the seven months ended december  of  the company also had an increase in interest expense of  during the seven months ended december  over the same period of the previous year as a result of the interest on the company s convertible debt 
operations for the seven months ended december  resulted in a loss of  or per share as compared to a loss of  or per share for the seven months ended december  fiscal compared to fiscal revenues revenues from operations decreased by  to  during fiscal from the  recognized during fiscal components of this decrease are reductions of  in motel  real estate and airport operations  mineral sales of  mineral royalties of  and management fees of  mineral sales during fiscal resulted from purchase of uranium oxide on the open market to fill uranium sales contracts and the sale of a uranium contract to a third party 
we did not supply any of the uranium sold under the contracts from production out of our mines 
we have not produced any minerals from mines for several years 
the uranium contracts expired and no molybdenum advance royalties have been received since the reduction of motel  real estate and airport operations of  was primarily as a result of reduced revenues at our ticaboo motel in southern utah 
the reduction in revenues in the tourism business is attributed to the general decline in the economy as well as the negative effect that the terrorist attacks have had on people s desire to travel 
there were no mineral sales during fiscal while there was one delivery under a uranium contract as well as the sale of one of the company s uranium contracts to a third party during fiscal currently the company does not have any delivery contracts for uranium or any other mineral 
depending on the outcome of the smp litigation  the company may well have cis pounds of uranium for which it will need to obtain delivery contracts 
the company holds a gross royalty on the mt 
emmons molybdenum deposit near crested butte  co 
under the provisions of the royalty agreement  the company and crested are to receive  pounds of molybdenum or its cash equivalent annually as an advance royalty 
the royalty agreement was originally made with amax inc  which was purchased by cyprus minerals company in and changed its name to cyprus amax minerals company cyprus amax 
in  cyprus amax was purchased by phelps dodge corporation 
amax and cyprus had made the advance royalty payments to usecc on a timely basis 
phelps dodge made one advance royalty payment and ceased making payments in fiscal phelps dodge suspended payments under the advance royalty agreement and has sued the company 
the company has filed counter claims against phelps dodge requesting that the advance royalty and other issues be reinstated 
it is not known what the outcome of this litigation will be 
management fees were reduced by  in fiscal from the prior period due to reduced activity in the entities from which management fees are collected 
costs and expenses during fiscal  costs and expenses were reduced by  this reduction was as a result of reduced activity in our commercial operations in southern utah because some of the operations were leased to third parties  and the general economy turned down as a result of terrorist attacks 
this reduced both revenues as discussed above and costs and expenses of  the holding costs of mineral properties were reduced by  as a result of the company reducing costs associated with mineral properties that are shut down 
the general and administrative costs were reduced by  in addition to these reductions in costs and expenses  the company recognized an expense of  in abandonment of mining equipment during fiscal there was no abandonment expense in fiscal these reductions in costs and expenses were offset by increases in impairment of goodwill of  provision for doubtful accounts of  and other expenses of  the impairment of goodwill came as a result of the company purchasing an additional of rmg equity or  shares of rmg stock by issuing  shares of the company s common stock 
the shares of the company s common stock were valued at per share 
an impairment of  was taken on this investment in rmg as rmg had no gas production and the impairment brought the total investment in rmg in line with the fair market value of the rmg assets 
a provision for doubtful accounts was provided on the balance of a note receivable that the company held for the sale of ruby mining company to admiralty corporation 
the note was in the original amount of  and had been reduced to  the note went in default during fiscal at which time the company began negotiations with admiralty to resolve the issue of the outstanding balance 
terms were reached which required admiralty to pay interest on the note  plus accrued interest  through august  at which time the entire note balance would come due 
because of the financial condition of admiralty  it is not known if that company will be able to pay the balance of the note when due 
the entire amount of the note was therefore reserved 
other income and expenses gain on sale of assets income decreased by  during fiscal to  this decrease was as a result of the sale of a majority of the surplus mining equipment that the company had for sale during the prior year 
during fiscal  there was no income from litigation settlements while during fiscal there was  in litigation settlement as a result of the company settling all issues appertaining to the kennecott litigation 
interest income increased by  during fiscal over fiscal as did interest expense which increased by  for the same period 
these increases were as a result of larger amounts of cash invested in interest bearing accounts and increased debt 
operations for the twelve months ended may   resulted in a net loss of  or per share as compared to net income of  or per share for the previous year 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues operating revenues during fiscal decreased  from revenues for the previous year to  this decrease was primarily as a result of a decrease in revenues from motel  real estate and airport operations 
this decrease was offset by increases in mineral sales and management fees 
during fiscal  we recorded  in revenues from mineral sales compared with no mineral sales revenue during the previous year 
the increase was the result of the sale of a uranium delivery contract to a non affiliated company  and a delivery of uranium made under that market related contract before the sale of the contract 
there were no similar sales of uranium contracts or uranium during the same period of the prior year 
the company purchased the uranium necessary to deliver to its contract 
revenues from motel  real estate and airport operations decreased from  at may  to  at may  this decrease is as result of the mine tour at sgmc and the boat storage  restaurant and convenience store operations being leased to third parties by plateau during fiscal management fees increased  to  during fiscal this increase was due to rmg operations on which we receive a management fee 
costs and expenses costs and expenses decreased by  during fiscal to  from  during the previous year 
this reduction in costs and expenses came as a result of reduced motel  real estate and airport operations expense of  and general and administrative costs and expenses of  these reductions in costs and expenses were offset by increases in mineral holding costs and expenses of  and abandonment of mining equipment of  general and administrative costs during fiscal were significantly higher than those experienced during fiscal due to a noncash charge to operations of  as a result of the issuance of common shares of rmg stock below the market 
other reductions in general and administrative costs and expenses during fiscal were related to a reduction of staff 
other income and expenses as a result of the settlement of the kennecott litigation   was recorded as revenue during fiscal this revenue has two components noncash revenues as a result of the recognition of  of a deferred gmmv purchase option payment that was received in and the receipt of cash from kennecott as a result of the settlement   net of accounts receivable from gmmv 
during the fiscal  we recognized a gain of  from the sale of equipment that was determined to be surplus 
one component of this amount was the sale of certain gmmv assets that were distributed to the company from the gmmv upon the resolution of the kennecott litigation 
the other main components of this increase are the final royalty payment received from the sale of the brunton company of  and the sale of real estate in colorado of operations for the fiscal year ended may   resulted in earnings of  or per share fully diluted as compared to a loss of  or per share fully diluted for the fiscal year ended may  future operations we have generated operating losses as of the seven months ended december  and in each of the three fiscal years ended may  as a result of costs associated with shut down mineral properties 
we have discontinued our focus on these properties and at december   we are committed to be in the coalbed methane business well into the future 
effects of changes in prices mineral operations are significantly affected by changes in commodity prices 
as prices for a particular mineral increase  prices for prospects for that mineral also increase  making acquisitions of such properties costly  and sales advantageous 
conversely  a price decline facilitates acquisitions of properties containing that mineral  but makes sales of such properties more difficult 
operational impacts of changes in mineral commodity prices are common in the mining industry 
natural gas 
our decision to expand into the coalbed methane gas industry were predicated on the projections for natural gas demand and prices 
the company is confident that it can maintain its costs at industry coalbed methane industry standards but cannot predict what will happen to the price of coalbed methane gas 
uranium and gold 
changes in the prices of uranium and gold are not expected to materially affect our operations during molybdenum and oil 
changes in prices of molybdenum and petroleum are not expected to materially affect our operations during
