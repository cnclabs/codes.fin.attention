the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  including statements regarding anticipated costs and expenses  anticipated gross margins  mix of revenues and plans for introducing new products and services 
our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including those discussed below  under risk factors and elsewhere in this form k 
overview we were founded in and sold our first products and services in under the name software technologies corporation 
from to our sales and marketing efforts were primarily focused on customers in the healthcare industry 
in  we began to significantly increase our sales and marketing expenses to target customers in other vertical markets  such as financial services insurance  manufacturing  retail e commerce services  telecommunications  energy services and government 
in november we launched the fourth generation of our product e gate  which introduced a fully distributed  fault tolerant architecture 
we are currently shipping an enhanced version of our ebusiness integration suite ebi suite  version to our customers and in march we announced our new suite of products  integrated composite application network ican version  which we expect to begin shipping in the second quarter  however  the determination of when and if version will be made available remains at the sole discretion of the company 
we incurred significant losses in and  and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
in october  we changed our name to seebeyond technology corporation 
we derive revenues primarily from three sources licenses  services and maintenance 
we market our products and services on a global basis through our direct sales force  and augment our marketing efforts through relationships with systems integrators and technology vendors 
our products are typically licensed directly to customers for a perpetual term  with pricing based on the number of systems or applications the customer is integrating or connecting with our products 
we record license revenues when a license agreement has been signed by both parties  the fee is fixed or determinable  collection of the fee is probable  delivery of our products has occurred and no other significant obligations remain 
payments for licenses  services and maintenance received in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as deferred revenue 
we currently have operations in countries outside of the united states 
revenues as a percentage of total revenue  derived from international sales represent in  in and in we believe international revenues will continue to be significant in future periods 
revenues from services include consulting and implementation services and training 
a majority of our customers use third party systems integrators to implement our products 
customers also typically purchase additional consulting services from us to support their implementation activities 
these consulting services are generally sold on a time and materials or fixed fee basis  and services revenues are recognized as the services are performed 
we also offer training services  which are sold on a per student basis and for which revenues are recognized as the classes are attended 
customers who license our products normally purchase maintenance contracts 
these contracts provide unspecified software upgrades and technical support over a fixed term  which is typically months 
maintenance contracts are usually paid in advance  and revenues from these contracts are recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
our cost of revenues includes cost of license revenues  cost of services revenues and cost of maintenance revenues 
each category  except cost of license revenues  includes related expenses for salaries  employee benefits  incentive compensation  bonuses  travel  telephone  communications  rent and allocated facilities and professional fees 
cost of license revenues includes the cost of third party licensed software embedded or bundled with our products 
cost of services revenues consists of compensation and related overhead costs for personnel engaged in implementation consulting and services  training and out of pocket expenses 
cost of maintenance revenues includes compensation and related overhead costs for personnel engaged in maintenance and support activities 
for the year ended december   our gross margin was on our license revenues  on our services revenues and on our maintenance revenues 
we expect in the future to continue to earn substantially higher gross margins on our license and maintenance revenues as compared to our services revenues 
as a result  our overall gross margin depends significantly on our revenue mix 
our sales and marketing expenses include additional expenditures specific to the marketing group  such as public relations and advertising  trade shows  and marketing collateral materials and expenditures specific to the sales group  such as commissions 
to date  all software product development costs have been expensed as incurred 
also included in our total costs and expenses are restructuring charges  amortizations of goodwill  sales and marketing warrants and stock compensation 
in order to increase both our company s and our products market presence  we entered into strategic alliances with computer sciences corporation csc in march  electronic data systems corporation eds in january and accenture in november we granted a warrant to each of these parties to purchase up to  shares of our common stock  which became exercisable upon the achievement of various milestones  which included the creation of e gate software market offerings in the case of accenture and csc and the generation of seebeyond license revenues by selling licenses of our software products to third parties in the case of eds and csc 
these warrants had a per share exercise price of for accenture  for eds and for csc 
the fair value of these warrants was measured at the date of grant in accordance with emerging issues task force no 
using the black scholes option pricing model  we valued the warrants granted to accenture in at million and the warrants granted to eds and csc at million 
these amounts are included in additional paid in capital and were being amortized by charges to operations over the vesting periods of the warrants 
in december  we extended the duration of the eds warrant agreement 
as a result  we remeasured the value of the warrant and related expense  which is reflected in the results of operations for in january  the accenture warrant was exercised and was converted to  shares of common stock of the company 
in march  the csc warrant agreement was cancelled and all rights under the warrant agreement  including all fully vested shares were forfeited 
in july  the eds warrant expired without being exercised 
we recognized amortization of  million and million for  and for these alliance warrants  respectively 
the amortization of the alliance warrants is classified as a separate component of operating expenses in our consolidated statement of operations 
in march  we entered into a four year co marketing agreement with general motors corporation gmc and issued gmc a warrant to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
as a result of the december private placement of  shares of our common stock  the exercise price of this warrant was adjusted to per share 
the warrant expires in march and  shares under the warrant were exercisable immediately 
the remaining  shares subject to the warrant are performance based and vest and become exercisable over the thirty six month period following the issuance of the warrant provided the warrant holder has achieved various milestones related to providing certain sales an marketing support 
the unvested portion of the warrant was valued as of the date of issuance and is being amortized as a charge to marketing expense over the term of the co marketing agreement 
as of december   a total of  shares subject to the warrant were vested 
we recognized amortization of  and million for and  respectively  for this warrant 
the value of the unvested portion of the warrant will be adjusted in each reporting period based on changes in the fair value of the warrants until such date as the warrants are fully vested 
there is no obligation for this strategic partner to make future product purchases from us in connection with stock option grants to our employees  we have recorded deferred stock compensation totaling million through december   of which approximately  remains to be amortized as of december  this amount represents the difference between the exercise price and the deemed fair value of our common stock on the date the options were granted multiplied by the number of option shares granted 
this amount is included as a component of stockholders equity and is being amortized by charges to operations over the vesting period of the options  consistent with the method described in financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
we recognized amortization of deferred compensation expense of  in  million in and million in the amortization of the remaining deferred stock compensation at december  will result in additional charges to operations through the amortization of stock compensation is classified as a separate component of operating expenses in our consolidated statement of operations
