item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general as of december   we operated guitar center stores  with stores in major markets and stores in secondary markets 
we also operate the largest direct response channel musician s friend catalog and internet in the musical instruments industry in the united states 
in addition  we acquired the assets of american music group and related companies in the second quarter of american music  through its family music retail stores  is a provider of band instruments and accessories  and primarily focuses on school band and orchestral instrument sales and rentals 
the american music business operates as a division of our retail business 
from to  our net sales grew at an annual compound growth rate of  principally due to the comparable store sales growth of our retail stores averaging per year  the opening of new stores  and a per year increase in the direct response channel 
we believe such volume increases are the result of the continued success of the implementation of our business strategy  continued growth in the music products industry and increasing consumer awareness of the guitar center  musician s friend and american music brand names 
we achieved comparable store sales growth of   and for the fiscal years ended december   and  respectively 
we do not expect total or comparable store sales to continue to increase at historical rates  as we already maintain operations in most major markets for our industry  and a higher percentage of our new stores opened will be in secondary markets 
we expect that these secondary market stores will contribute lower sales per store than historically achieved from our stores operating in major markets we opened a total of guitar center stores in and currently anticipate opening approximately to guitar center stores in some of these guitar center stores will be smaller format units designed for secondary markets 
we opened a total of eight american music stores in  five of the eight by acquisition of m m music  a band instrument retailer 
in addition  we plan to open six to eight american music stores during  some of which will likely be from acquisitions of existing businesses 
we will continue to pursue our strategy of clustering stores in major markets to take advantage of operating and advertising efficiencies and to build awareness of the guitar center and american music group brand names in new markets 
in some markets this clustering strategy results in some transfer of sales from existing stores to new locations 
as we enter new markets  we expect that we will initially incur higher administrative and promotional costs per store than is currently experienced in established markets 
we expect competition to continue to increase as other music product retailers attempt to execute national growth strategies 
our business strategy will also emphasize opportunities to continue to grow each of our brands  including through further acquisitions if attractive candidates can be located for reasonable prices 
discussion of critical accounting policies in the ordinary course of business  we have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
additionally  the policy described below regarding credits and other vendor allowances is unique to our industry and deserves the attention of a reader of our financial statements 
valuation of inventory we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method 
rental inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the specific identification method and are depreciated on a straight line basis over the term of the associated rental agreement for rent to own sales  or over the estimated useful life of the rented instrument for rental only items 
we record adjustments to the value of inventory based upon obsolescence and changes in market value 
applicable costs associated with bringing inventory through our guitar center retail distribution center are capitalized to inventory 
the amounts are expensed to cost of goods sold as the associated inventory is sold 
management has evaluated the current level of inventories considering future customer demand for our products  taking into account general economic conditions  growth prospects within the marketplace  competition  market acceptance of current and upcoming products  and management initiatives 
based on this evaluation  we have recorded adjustments to cost of goods sold for estimated decreases in value 
these judgments are made in the context of our customers shifting needs  social and technological trends  and changes in the demographic mix of our customers 
a misinterpretation or misunderstanding of these conditions and uncertainties in the future outlook of our industry or the economy  or other failure to estimate correctly  could result in inventory valuation changes  either favorably or unfavorably  compared to the requirement determined to be appropriate as of the balance sheet date 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets such as property and equipment  goodwill  cost method investments and identifiable intangibles  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important  which could trigger impairment include  among other things significant underperformance relative to historical or projected operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  and significant decline in stock value for a sustained period 
the determination of whether impairment has occurred is based on an estimate of undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets at the store level  as compared to the carrying value of the assets 
assumptions used in these cash flows are consistent with internal forecasts and consider current and future expected sales volumes and related operating costs and any anticipated increases or declines based on expected market conditions and local business environment factors 
if a potential impairment is identified  the amount of the impairment loss recognized would be determined by estimating the fair value of the assets and recording a loss if the fair value was less than the book value 
fair value will be determined based on appraisal values assessed by third parties  if deemed necessary  or the undiscounted future cash flows as determined above 
for cost method investments  we would record a loss when the decline in value is other than temporary 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less selling costs 
our assessment regarding the existence of impairment factors is based on market conditions and the operational performance of our business 
our review of factors present and the resulting appropriate carrying value of our goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets are subject to judgments and estimates that management is required to make 
sales returns as part of our satisfaction guaranteed policy  we allow guitar center customers to return product generally within days after the date of purchase  we allow direct response customers to return product within days 
we regularly review and revise  when deemed necessary  our estimates of sales returns based upon historical trends 
while our estimates during the past few years have closely approximated actual results  actual returns may differ significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from estimates if factors such as economic conditions or the competitive environment differ from our expectations 
credits and other vendor allowances we receive cooperative advertising allowances ie  an allowance from the manufacturer to subsidize qualifying advertising and similar promotional expenditures we make relating to the vendor s products  price protection credits ie  credits from vendors with respect to in stock inventory if the vendor subsequently lowers their wholesale price for such products and vendor rebates ie  credits or rebates provided by vendors based on the purchase of specified products and paid at a later date 
cooperative advertising allowances are recognized as a reduction to selling  general  and administrative expense when we incur the advertising expense eligible for the credit 
we recognized cooperative advertising allowances of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  recorded as an offset to selling  general and administrative expense 
price protection credits and vendor rebates are accounted for as a reduction of the cost of merchandise inventory and are recorded at the time the credit or rebate is earned 
the effect of price protection credits and vendor rebates is recognized in the income statement at the time the related inventory is sold  as a reduction in cost of goods sold 
none of these credits are recorded as revenue 
results of operations the following table sets forth current and historical income statement data as a percentage of net sales fiscal year ended december  net sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income other expense write off of investment in non consolidated entity interest expense  net total other expense income before income taxes income taxes net income fiscal compared to fiscal net sales for the year ended december  increased to billion  compared with million last year 
net sales from retail stores for fiscal totaled million  a increase from million in fiscal sales from new stores contributed million and represent of the total increase in retail store sales 
comparable store sales for the full year increased 
the increase in comparable store sales was due to good response to our advertising and marketing for our guitar center stores and the closure of a competitor  mars music  which was in markets also served by us 
our management is presently anticipating comparable store sales growth of to for the immediate future  although fluctuations will undoubtedly take place from period to period 
the foregoing statement is a forward looking statement and is subject to the qualifications set forth below under forward looking statements  business risks 
net sales from the direct response channel totaled million in  a million  or  increase from  due primarily to increased orders driven by higher circulation and promotional targeting and an increase in the average order 
although catalogs are mailed to both internet and catalog customers  we continue to see a shifting in customer preference towards placing orders via the internet 
catalog sales  which consist of all orders placed through the contact center  increased to million in from million in internet sales for the year  which represents orders placed via the internet  increased to million from million last year 
one of our primary competitors  mars music  inc  filed for federal bankruptcy court protection on september  and has completed a liquidation resulting in the closure of all of its stores 
we cannot predict the impact the closure of mars will have on our business  including how many of the mars customers will move their shopping to our businesses versus our competitors 
during the second quarter of  we adopted a new accounting policy to conform with eitf  accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs 
prior to adopting eitf  shipping and handling fees paid by our customers to our direct response division were recognized as a reduction to cost of goods sold 
to conform with eitf  we now treat such fees as revenue 
as a result  million and million of shipping and handling fees were recognized as direct response division revenue in the years and  respectively 
the reclassification of these fees has no effect on operating income  net income or earnings per share for any period 
we have made a conforming reclassification in all historical accounting periods to provide a comparable presentation 
please see our current report on form k dated july  for a schedule of the reclassification amounts applied to our historical financial statements in order to implement this accounting policy

the gross profit margin for the direct response division was for compared to in the improvement in margin is attributed to better pricing and favorable market conditions compared to the post environment in  as well as a shift towards internet ordering which presents customers with a higher margin assortment of accessories and other low cost products not carried in the catalogs of sales 
reduced shipping costs of sales are due to efficiency improvements at the distribution center  including the implementation of marry up shipping techniques

operating income  for the reasons stated above  increased to million from million in fiscal as a percentage of sales  operating income was in both years ended december  and  respectively 
in  we recorded a million  non cash charge to reflect the write off of our minority interest in a non consolidated entity 
this charge reflected our assessment of the likely future cash flows from the investment in light of the uncertainties regarding the ongoing business of this entity 
no similar cost was incurred in interest expense  net for fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal the decrease is due to lower interest rates applicable to our line of credit borrowings and a  non recurring charge in related to the extension of our line of credit and replacement of one of our former lenders  offset by additional borrowings 
income tax expense for fiscal was million compared to million for the same period last year 
in the prior year we did not recognize a tax benefit on the million write off of the minority investment in a non consolidated entity because of the capital nature of the write down and the uncertainty that we will have future capital gains to utilize the capital loss 
excluding the effect of the write off of the minority investment  our effective tax rates for each of the years ending december  and was

comparable store sales for the full year increased 
net sales from the direct response channel totaled million in  a million increase from the growth in direct response sales has been driven by continued increases in internet sales offset in part by a slight decline in catalog sales 
catalog sales decreased to million in from million in internet sales for the year increased to million from million last year 
the trend in favor of internet sales over catalog sales is expected to continue 
we believe that revenues in the direct response division were adversely affected by weak economic conditions affecting the hobbyist customer base of this unit 
total sales have been adversely affected by the recent slow down in the overall us economy 
during the second quarter of  we adopted a new accounting policy to conform with eitf  accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs 
prior to adopting eitf  shipping and handling fees paid by our customers to our direct response division were recognized as a reduction to cost of goods sold 
to conform with eitf  we now treat such fees as revenue

gross profit margin percentage for the retail stores in after buying and occupancy costs was compared to in retail gross margins improved due to higher gross margins for the american music business compared to the guitar center business  as well as improvement in inventory shrinkage offset by higher occupancy costs 
the gross profit margin for the direct response division was for compared to in the decrease is primarily due to a reduction in selling prices and an increase in promotional offers  offset by targeted marketing of identified slow moving products through new sales channels  including the kansas city retail outlet

interest expense  net for fiscal increased to million from million in fiscal interest expense consisted primarily of interest on our senior notes and borrowings under the line of credit primarily used to fund the acquisition of american music  additions to inventory  and capital expenditures for our store expansions 
included in interest expense  net is a  charge in connection with the extension of our line of credit and the replacement of one of the former lenders in the syndicate 
the overall increase in interest expense  net reflects increased borrowings under our credit facility  offset by a reduction in interest rates applicable to those borrowings 
income tax expense for fiscal was million compared to million for the same period in fiscal we did not recognize a tax benefit on the million write off of the minority investment in a non consolidated entity because of the capital nature of the write down and the uncertainty that we will have future capital gains to utilize the capital loss 
net income for fiscal decreased to million from million in fiscal as a result of the combinations of factors described above 
liquidity and capital resources our need for liquidity will arise primarily from the funding of capital expenditures  working capital requirements and payments on our indebtedness  as well as possible acquisitions 
we have historically financed our operations primarily through internally generated funds and borrowings under our credit facilities 
please see item business risks related to the business for a discussion of factors which could reasonably likely result in a decrease in the amount of internally generated funds available to finance capital expenditures and working capital requirements 
we have no mandatory payments of principal on the million of senior notes outstanding prior to their final maturity in as of december   we had million outstanding under the credit facility  excluding million outstanding on letters of credit  and had available borrowings of million 
the credit facility permits borrowings up to million  subject to borrowing base limitations million at december  
the actual amount available is tied to our inventory and receivable base  and repayment obligations under the credit facility are secured by liens on our principal assets 
a fee of is assessed on the unused portion of the credit facility 
borrowings bear interest at either the prime rate plus an applicable margin rate at december   or at libor plus an applicable margin rate at december   at our option  with interest due monthly 
the applicable margin rate is based upon a quarterly calculation of average daily availability at the end of each fiscal quarter 
borrowings are subject to a minimum annual interest rate of 
the applicable interest rate at december  was libor plus 
the agreement underlying the credit facility includes significant restrictive negative covenants 
among other things  these covenants restrict our ability to incur debt and issue specified equity instruments  incur liens on our assets  make any significant change in our corporate structure or the nature of our business  dispose of assets  make guaranties  prepay debt  engage in a change in control transaction  pay dividends  make investments or acquisitions  engage in transactions with affiliates and incur capital expenditures  and also require that we satisfy specified financial requirements including a tangible net worth test and a minimum availability test 
under the tangible net worth test  we are required to maintain  as of each quarter end  a minimum level of tangible net worth which  under the agreement  is defined as stockholders equity  less goodwill  plus million or million at december  
the minimum amounts required by the agreement increase on a quarterly basis and are million at december   million at march   million at june   million at september   million at december  and million at march  and thereafter 
the minimum availability test requires that we maintain million of reserved availability under the agreement based on its borrowing base limitations 
the amount we disclose in our public reports from time to time as available to borrow under the agreement million at december  is already reduced by this required reserve and thus represents a net amount available under the agreement 
the agreement also includes representations and warranties which must be true each time we borrow funds under the credit facility and affirmative covenants 
the full text of the contractual requirements imposed by this financing is set forth in the amended and restated loan and security agreement which has been filed with the securities and exchange commission 
we were in compliance with such requirements as of december  subject to limited cure periods  the lenders under our credit facility may demand repayment of these borrowings prior to stated maturity upon the occurrence of specified events  including if we breach the terms of the agreement  suffer a material adverse change  engage in a change in control transaction  suffer a significant adverse legal judgment  default on other significant obligations  or in the event of specified events of insolvency 
the credit agreement matures in december the senior notes  which are unsecured obligations  are governed by an indenture 
the indenture requires that we pay interest at a rate of per annum in semi annual coupons due on each july and january  with all outstanding principal due and payable in july we have the right to prepay some or all of the notes at any time for an amount equal to principal  accrued interest and a premium  subject to a notice requirement 
the premium is presently of the principal amount redeemed  but reduces to on july  and to zero from and after july  in the event of a change in control transaction  the holders of the senior notes may require repayment of the principal and accrued interest plus a premium 
the indenture includes restrictive covenants 
among other things  these covenants restrict our ability to incur debt and issue specified equity instruments  incur liens on our assets  make any significant change in our corporate structure or the nature of our business  pay dividends  make investments  make guaranties  and dispose of assets 
the full text of the contractual requirements imposed by this financing is set forth in the indenture which has been filed with the securities and exchange commission 
we were in compliance with such requirements as of december  subject to limited cure periods  the holders of the senior notes may demand repayment of these borrowings prior to stated maturity upon the occurrence of specified events  including if we breach the terms of the indenture  in the event of specified events of insolvency  if we suffer a significant adverse legal judgment or if other significant obligations are accelerated 
the terms of our significant financing agreements  including those related to our credit facility  the senior notes and the equipment lease facilities described below  are not dependent on any change in our credit rating 
we believe that the key company specific factors affecting our ability to maintain our existing debt and lease financing relationships and to access such capital in the future are our present and expected levels of profitability and cash flow from operations  our working capital and fixed asset collateral bases  our expected level of capital expenditures  and the level of equity capital of the company relative to the level of debt obligations 
in addition  as noted above  our existing agreements include significant restrictions on future financings  including among others  limits on the amount of indebtedness that we may incur and whether or not such indebtedness may be secured by any of our assets 
during the first quarter of  we entered into master operating lease agreements with general electric capital corporation and us bank to lease equipment and other property primarily to support the operations of the new central distribution center for our guitar center retail stores 
under these agreements  we leased a total of million in equipment and other property 
the agreement calls for monthly payments to general electric capital corporation of  for a term of months through september   and monthly payments to us bank of  for a term of months through december  the leases have options to extend through september  and december   respectively 
as is the case with most multi unit retailers  substantially all of the real property used in our business is leased under operating lease agreements 
please see  item properties  disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments and note to our financial statements 
for the year ended december   cash provided by operating activities was million  most of which represented cash income from operations  net of additions to inventory 
cash used in investing activities totaled million  which primarily consisted of capital expenditures for retail store expansions and computer equipment purchases million  and acquisitions million 
cash provided by financing activities totaled million  which consisted principally of borrowings under our credit facility 
our principal working capital need is to provide for the inventory levels necessary to support our sales activities  particularly the guitar center retail stores 
inventory increased from million to million  or 
the increase in inventory was required principally to support existing sales growth  the opening of new retail locations and the opening of the new guitar center retail distribution center 
inventory per square foot at guitar center retail stores guitar center store and distribution center inventories under gaap divided by total store retail square footage on a given date was at december  compared to in our ongoing objective is to improve inventory performance by refining our replenishment processes and systems  utilizing a distribution center for our guitar center stores  and through improved planning  presentation and display of inventories in our retail stores 
inventory increased from million at december  to million at december   or  against increased sales of  for the direct response division  reflecting increased inventory turns 
we provide limited credit to corporate customers and similar house accounts on a current account basis 
we generally do not provide credit to our retail customers but instead offer programs provided by third party consumer credit companies which are non recourse to us  meaning that the risk of non payment is borne by the third party provider so long as we comply with its administrative and approval policies 
from time to time we participate in programs that provide our customers with below market interest rates  deferred payments or similar benefits 
these programs are also non recourse to us but we pay the credit provider a fee which is recognized as a component of selling  general and administrative expense at the time of the sale to the consumer 
we intend to pursue an aggressive growth strategy by opening additional stores in new and existing markets 
during  we opened new guitar center stores 
each new large format guitar center store typically has required approximately to million for gross inventory 
historically  our cost of capital improvements for a large format guitar center store has been approximately  consisting of leasehold improvements  fixtures and equipment 
we incur higher costs in some geographic areas  particularly the northeast 
we have developed smaller guitar center stores to build in secondary markets or sites that we do not believe will support our large format units 
the first of these units was opened in late and more had been opened as of december  our small format stores have typically incurred approximately  in capital expenditures and require approximately million to million in inventory 
we are also anticipating additional capital and strategic requirements related to improving our fulfillment facilities  upgrading our technology and systems  and pursuing new opportunities in the e commerce activities of our retail and direct response divisions as well as related businesses 
in july  we leased a new distribution facility for musician s friend in kansas city  and in july we closed our existing distribution facilities in medford  oregon and knoxville  tennessee and consolidated all direct response fulfillment in kansas city 
during  we began construction of a distribution center in the indianapolis  indiana area to support our guitar center retail store operations 
the facility commenced operations in july we have entered into a year agreement to lease the facility and we also have entered into numerous additional commitments necessary to support the operations of the facility 
as of december   nearly all product was flowing through the distribution facility  with the exception of special orders which will continue  for the most part  to be drop shipped to our stores 
migration from our former drop ship model to a centralized distribution model is an important development in our operating strategy and has required the allocation of significant financial and managerial resources 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  a portion of the costs of operating this facility are absorbed into our guitar center merchandise inventories and recognized as an element of cost of goods sold when the related inventory is sold 
this could result in a slight decrease in reported gross margin depending on our success in defraying these additional costs  although we also expect to realize efficiencies involving other costs such as selling  general and administrative and interest expense 
we also continue to make significant investments in information technology across our businesses and to incur costs and make investments designed to expand the reach of our businesses on the internet 
the costs of these initiatives and other investments related to our businesses will continue to be significant 
during  we expect to incur approximately million to million in capital expenditures 
our expansion strategy is to continue to increase our market share in existing markets and to penetrate strategically selected new markets 
we opened a total of guitar center stores in and stores in  and currently anticipate opening approximately to guitar center stores in some of these stores will be smaller format units designed for secondary markets 
we opened a total of eight american music stores in  five of the eight by acquisition of m m music  a band instrument and retail merchandise retailer 
during  we plan to open six to eight american music stores  some which will likely be acquisitions of existing businesses 
we believe there exists a number of acquisition opportunities in the relatively fragmented band instruments market that could be a good fit into our american music platform 
we also believe there may be attractive opportunities to expand by selectively acquiring existing music products retailers or other complimentary businesses  if attractive opportunities can be identified 
while we cannot provide assurance that we will complete any further acquisition transactions  in the ordinary course of our business we investigate and engage in negotiations regarding such opportunities 
acquisitions will be financed with drawings under our existing credit facilities  expansion of our credit facilities  issuance of debt or equity securities  or a combination  depending upon transaction size and market conditions  among other things 
our capital resources and liquidity for are presently expected to be primarily provided by net cash flow from operations and additional borrowings under our credit facility 
depending upon market conditions  we may also elect or be required to raise additional capital in the form of common or preferred equity  debt or convertible securities for the purpose of providing additional capital to fund working capital needs or continued growth of our existing business  or to refinance existing obligations 
any such financing activity will be dependent upon many factors  including our liquidity needs  market conditions and prevailing market terms  and we can not assure you that future external financing for guitar center will be available on attractive terms or at all

we may need to renegotiate our credit facility prior to the expiration date depending on our future capital needs  our working capital base and alternative sources of financing available 
operating lease commitments consist principally of real property leases for our corporate offices  retail store facilities and distribution centers 
these leases frequently include options which permit us to extend the terms beyond the initial fixed lease term 
we also have rented personal property through operating leases 
payments for these lease commitments are provided for by cash flows generated from operations

sales in the fourth quarter are typically significantly higher on a per store basis and through the direct response unit than in any other quarter 
inflation we believe that the relatively moderate rates of inflation experienced in recent years have not had a significant impact on our net sales or profitability 
forward looking statements  business risks this annual report contains forward looking statements relating to  among other things  future results of operations  growth and investment plans  sales  trends in gross margin  growth in the internet business and other factors affecting growth in sales and earnings 
specific forward looking statements are provided regarding our management s current views regarding comparable store sales  new store openings  and capital expenditure levels 
statements regarding new store openings are based largely on our current expectations and are necessarily subject to associated business risks related to  among other things  the identification of suitable sites or acquisition opportunities  the timely construction  staffing and merchandising of those stores and other matters  some of which are outside of our control
