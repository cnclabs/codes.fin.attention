the company s us federal sector revenues were derived from the following sources fiscal fiscal fiscal percent percent dollars in millions amount change amount change amount department of defense civil agencies other total us federal sector revenues from the us federal sector increased during fiscal versus fiscal the contribution of former dyncorp operations from the date of acquisition  march  to march  accounted for million or approximately of us federal sector s revenue growth 
the remaining revenue growth of  or million  is principally attributable to new and increased work related to intelligence community activities  the internal revenue service irs prime contract  general services administration contracts  and an immigration and naturalization service contract 
revenues for fiscal compared with fiscal increased 
the increase was principally related to new and increased work related to intelligence community activities  the army logistics modernization contract logmod  the irs prime contract and several other task order activities on both civil agency and department of defense dod contracts

during the third quarter of fiscal  the securities and exchange commission staff indicated the guidance in emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products should be applied broadly to all forms of consideration provided by a vendor to its customer  and all arrangements in which an entity pays cash or other forms of consideration to its customers 
accordingly  such consideration is now accounted for as a reduction of revenue 
the company acquires information technology assets from outsourcing clients at negotiated prices and subsequently records the assets at their fair values 
any excess paid over the fair value amounts the premium is included in outsourcing contract costs and amortized over the contract life 
in accordance with eitf issue no 
 amortization of premiums has been reclassified from costs and expenses to a reduction of revenue beginning in the third quarter of fiscal prior period amounts have been classified to conform to current year presentation 
these amounts reduced revenues and total costs and expenses by less than  with no impact on income 
costs and expenses the company s costs and expenses were as follows dollar amount percentage of revenue dollars in millions costs of services selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization interest expense  net special items total costs of services for fiscal  the company s costs of services as a percentage of revenue decreased to from 
performance improvements in our us outsourcing operations resulting from cost containment efforts  consolidation of regional and back office functions in multiple geographies  and use of less costly offshore sites contributed points of improvement 
performance improvements in our us federal sector  us consulting and systems integration  and other international operations contributed equally to 
points of improvement 
europe operations caused a 
point adverse shift  primarily due to revenue shortfalls resulting from soft i t project demand 
shifts in the mix of our business toward federal operations  which carry a higher ratio of costs of services  caused an adverse movement of 
points 
the company s costs of services as a percentage of revenue increased to from for fiscal compared to fiscal the change was primarily related to a decrease in demand for commercial consulting and systems integration services  which decreased utilization and impacted revenue realization 
the company also experienced cost pressure on certain outsourcing contracts 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company reclassified the provision for doubtful accounts from costs of services to selling  general and administrative 
prior period amounts have been adjusted to conform to current year presentation 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative sg a expenses as a percentage of revenue declined to from for fiscal versus fiscal the reduction in sg a is attributable to a million decrease in provision for doubtful accounts and european performance improvements of approximately million partially offset by us commercial and other international performance decline 
the favorable impact of a shift in the company s business mix towards the us federal sector  where sg a costs are lower as a percentage of revenue than the company s composite  substantially offset a decline in the us federal sector s performance in sg a 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue declined to from for fiscal versus fiscal the decrease was due to the company s continued cost reduction initiatives  management s focus on discretionary costs and consolidation of certain back office services 
during the year  the company realigned certain functions in its us healthcare operations with similar functions into other groups and integrated its pinnacle alliance unit into the financial services vertical operations 
the majority of the increase in the provision related to customer credit risks associated with certain parties for whom the company provided systems integration and consulting professional services 
depreciation and amortization the company s fiscal depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenue was virtually unchanged compared to fiscal last year s depreciation and amortization expense included million related to goodwill and employee workforce amortization which is no longer amortized as a result of the company s adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
on march  an approximate 
point improvement in depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenue from the absence of amortization of goodwill and employee workforce acquired was offset by depreciation related to additional investments during fiscal and fiscal in equipment and contract costs in support of our outsourcing clients 
depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenue increased to from for fiscal versus fiscal the increase was due primarily to the additional depreciation and amortization of assets associated with the company s increased outsourcing activities and increased goodwill amortization related to the december acquisition of mynd 
interest expense the million decrease in interest expense for fiscal net of interest income resulted from a lower average outstanding debt partially offset by a higher average interest rate and decreased interest income 
the increase of million for fiscal resulted principally from the increased debt associated with funding the mynd acquisition and purchases related to outsourcing activities 
special items in connection with the dyncorp acquisition in march  the company reviewed its operations  product strategies and the carrying value of its assets to identify any potential exit or disposal activities 
as a result  during the fourth quarter ended march   special items of million million after tax or cents per share diluted were recorded 
the special items related to software associated with prior csc operations now redundant to similar assets acquired with dyncorp 
in addition  certain identified equipment can no longer accommodate the larger  integrated us federal sector business  and its use will be discontinued during the first two quarters of fiscal  which will result in an estimated charge of million 
the company anticipates completing the exit and disposal activities related to the dyncorp acquisition by the end of the second quarter of fiscal during fiscal  the company reviewed its estimates related to the fiscal special charge discussion below and made certain adjustments 
these adjustments increased the facilities consolidation provision by million to million 
this adjustment was offset by a decrease of million related to the phased out operations and other assets provisions and by a decrease of million related to employee severance costs 
these adjustments resulted in total special charges related to phased out operations and other assets of million 
the decrease in employee severance costs was due to fewer us employee involuntary terminations 
as a result of renegotiations of certain international employee severance agreements  the company involuntarily terminated an additional international employees 
the net impact was an additional employees involuntarily terminated and a million reduction related to employee severance costs 
as a result of these actions  there was no net additional special charge recorded during fiscal during fiscal  special items of million million after tax were recorded as detailed below 
in response to a changing mix of information technology services  business conditions and overall demand for consulting and systems integration services  the company reviewed its global operations

upon completion of the integration of mynd during the fourth quarter ended march   the company recorded an additional special item of million million after tax or cents per share diluted for the write off of capitalized software and a provision for consolidation of facilities

income before taxes and margin for fiscal include special items of million described above in caption special items 
taxes the provision for income taxes as a percentage of pre tax earnings was  and for the three years ended march  the decrease of points in the effective tax rate from fiscal to fiscal resulted from the ceasing of goodwill and employee workforce amortization in fiscal  which decreased the effective rate by approximately points 
this decrease was partially offset by the reduced relative impact of permanent tax differences 
the change in effective tax rate to from for fiscal is principally related to the tax benefit of higher marginal rates applied to the fiscal special charge 
the tax rate applied to special items was and for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
net income and earnings per share the company s net income and diluted earnings per share for fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal are as follows dollar amount margin dollars in millions  except eps net income diluted earnings per share the net earnings margin was for fiscal  for fiscal and for fiscal the improvement for fiscal was principally attributable to lower costs of services and selling  general and administrative expenses 
during fiscal  the company s net income margin increased to from for fiscal primarily due to the impact of the fiscal special items  partially offset by the fiscal increases in costs of services  depreciation and amortization and interest expense as described above 
cash flows dollars in millions fiscal fiscal fiscal net cash from operations net cash used in investing net cash used in provided by financing effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year cash and cash equivalents at end of year historically  the majority of the company s cash and cash equivalents has been provided from operating activities 
during fiscal  net cash provided from operations decreased primarily due to a reduction in payables and accrued expenses  net of acquired dyncorp balances  partially offset by additional net earnings and a lesser increase in accounts receivable 
the company s investments principally relate to purchases of computer equipment and software  facilities  and deferred outsourcing contract costs that support the company s expanding global commercial and us federal sector operations 
investments include computer equipment purchased at the inception of outsourcing contracts as well as subsequent upgrades  expansion or replacement of these client supporting assets 
the company s investments also include acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  including significant amounts for the fiscal acquisition of dyncorp and the fiscal acquisition of mynd 
as described above  historically a majority of the company s capital investments have been funded by cash from operations 
the company issued million shares during the fourth quarter of fiscal to partially fund the dyncorp acquisition 
in addition  the company issued million of notes due february  the funds were used for general corporate purposes  including reduction of outstanding commercial paper which had increased as a result of paying off assumed dyncorp debt and the cash portion of the dyncorp consideration 
during fiscal  the company issued million of notes due june and million of notes due june the net proceeds were used for general corporate purposes  including the reduction of outstanding commercial paper 
liquidity and capital resources the balance of cash and cash equivalents was million at march   million at march  and million at march  during this period  the company s earnings have added to equity 
during fiscal  foreign currency translation adjustment increased equity by million while unfunded pension obligations decreased equity by million 
at the end of fiscal  csc s ratio of debt to total capitalization was 
dollars in millions debt equity total capitalization debt to total capitalization at march   the company had a commercial paper program  backed by two syndicated credit facilities  with a total capacity of million 
the credit facilities were comprised of a million facility  which expires on august  and a million facility  which expires august  at march   approximately million was available for borrowing under this program compared to million at the end of fiscal at march   the company had million borrowings under the commercial paper program and is in compliance with all terms of the agreements 
in addition  the company had uncommitted lines of credit of million available with certain foreign banks 
during fiscal  the company issued million shares of common stock and million worth of term debt from its fiscal shelf registration 
the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations by period as of march  less than more than dollars in millions year years years years total long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases minimum purchase obligations other long term liabilities total regarding minimum purchase obligations included above  the company has signed long term purchase agreements with certain software  hardware  telecommunication and other service providers to obtain favorable pricing  committed service levels and terms for services that are necessary for the operations of business activities 
the company is contractually committed to purchase specified service minimums over remaining periods ranging generally from to years 
if the company does not meet the specified service minimums  the company would have an obligation to pay the service provider a portion or all of the shortfall 
in the normal course of business  the company may provide certain customers and potential customers with financial performance guarantees  which are generally backed by standby letters of credit or surety bonds 
in general  the company would only be liable for the amount of these guarantees in the event of default in the performance of our obligations  the probability of which is remote in management s opinion 
the company is in compliance with the performance obligations under all service contracts for which there is a performance guarantee  and any liability incurred in connection with these guarantees would not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial position 
in addition  the company has other guarantees that represent parent guarantees in support of working capital uncommitted lines of credit established with local financial institutions for its foreign business units 
borrowings under these lines were million at march  the following table summarizes the expiration of the company s financial guarantees outstanding as of march  fiscal fiscal fiscal dollars in millions thereafter total performance guarantees surety bonds letters of credit other surety bonds standby letters of credit subsidiary debt guarantees total as of march   the amount of outstanding subsidiary debt under the subsidiary debt guarantees noted above was million 
in the opinion of management  csc will be able to meet its liquidity and cash needs for the foreseeable future through the combination of cash flows from operating activities  cash balances  unused borrowing capacity and other financing activities 
if these resources need to be augmented  major additional cash requirements would likely be financed by the issuance of debt and or equity securities and or the exercise of the put option as described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company s sources of debt include the issuance of commercial paper and short term borrowings 
if the company were unable to sell commercial paper or if the company determined it was too costly to do so  the company has the ability to borrow under the two syndicated backstop credit facilities 
dividends and redemption it has been the company s policy to invest earnings in the growth of the company rather than distribute earnings as dividends 
this policy  under which dividends have not been paid since fiscal  is expected to continue  but is subject to regular review by the board of directors 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements under summary of significant accounting policies 
the company s critical accounting policies related to revenue recognition include long term contracts  outsourcing contracts  and software sales 
the company also has critical accounting policies addressing outsourcing contract costs  software development costs  and retirement benefits 
revenue recognition long term contracts the company provides services under time and materials  level of effort  cost based  unit price and fixed price contracts 
for time and materials and level of effort types of contracts  revenue is recorded when services are provided at agreed upon billing rates 
for cost based contracts  revenue is recorded at the time such fees are probable and estimable by applying an estimated factor to costs as incurred  such factor being determined by the contract provisions and prior experience 
revenue is recognized on unit price contracts based on unit metrics times the agreed upon contract unit price 
revenue on long term  fixed price development contracts is recognized on the basis of the estimated percentage of completion if the company can dependably estimate and measure the extent of progress and the cost to complete 
the company applies this method of revenue recognition because projected contract revenues and costs are reasonably estimable based on the company s business practices  methods and historical experience 
the method requires estimates of costs and profits over the entire term of the contract  including estimates of resources and costs necessary to complete performance 
management regularly reviews project profitability and underlying estimates 
revisions to the estimates at completion are reflected in results of operations as a change in accounting estimate in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known by management 
provisions for estimated losses  if any  are recognized in the period in which the loss is determined 
revenue recognition outsourcing contracts revenue on outsourcing contracts is recognized based on the services performed or information processed during the period in accordance with contract terms and the agreed upon billing rates applied to the consumed service metrics 
revenue recognition software sales revenue from sales of proprietary software are recognized upon receipt of a signed contract documenting customer commitment  delivery of the software and determination of the fee amount and its probable collection 
however  if significant customization is required  revenue is recognized as the software customization services are performed in accordance with the percentage of completion method 
costs incurred in connection with sales of proprietary software are expensed as incurred  except for the costs of developing computer software products  which are capitalized and amortized over the life of the software products 
outsourcing contract costs costs on outsourcing contracts are generally expensed as incurred 
however  certain costs incurred upon initiation of an outsourcing contract are deferred and expensed over the contract life 
these costs consist of contract acquisition and transition costs  including the cost of due diligence activities after competitive selection and costs associated with installation of systems and processes 
costs incurred for bid and proposal activities are expensed as incurred 
fixed assets acquired in connection with outsourcing transactions are capitalized and depreciated consistent with fixed asset policies described in note amounts paid to clients in excess of the fair market value of acquired property and equipment premiums are capitalized as outsourcing contract costs and amortized over the contract life 
the amortization of such outsourcing contract cost premiums is accounted for as a reduction in revenue  as described in note management regularly reviews outsourcing contract costs for impairment 
terminations of outsourcing contracts  including transfers either back to the client or to another i t provider  prior to the end of their committed contract term are infrequent due to the complex transition of personnel  assets  methodologies  and processes involved with outsourcing transactions 
in the event of an early termination  the company and the client  pursuant to certain contractual provisions  engage in negotiations on the recovery of unamortized contract costs  lost profits  transfer of personnel  rights to implemented systems and processes  as well as other matters 
software development costs the company capitalizes costs incurred to develop commercial software products after technological feasibility has been established 
costs incurred to establish technological feasibility are charged to expense as incurred 
enhancements to software products are capitalized where such enhancements extend the life or significantly expand the marketability of the products 
capitalized software is amortized based on current and estimated future revenue from the product 
the amortization expense is not less than the straight line amortization expense over the product useful life 
the company capitalizes costs incurred to develop internal use computer software 
internal and external costs incurred in connection with development of upgrades or enhancements that result in additional functionality are also capitalized 
these capitalized costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the software 
purchased software is capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of the software 
retirement benefits the company offers a number of pension and postretirement healthcare and life insurance benefit plans 
csc utilizes actuarial methods required by sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  to account for pension and postretirement plans  respectively 
the actuarial methods require significant assumptions to calculate the net periodic pension benefit expense and the related pension benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension plans 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and discount rates 
in making these assumptions  we are required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates 
changes in the related net periodic pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these and other assumptions 
the assumption for the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is selected by taking into account the expected duration of the projected benefit obligation for the plans  the asset mix of the plans  historic plan asset returns as well as current market conditions and other factors 
our fiscal pension plan valuations utilized a weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets of compared to used in fiscal holding all other assumptions constant  a one half percent increase or decrease in the assumed weighted average rate of return on plan assets would have decreased or increased  respectively  the net periodic pension cost by approximately million 
the discount rate assumption reflects the market rate for high quality  fixed income debt instruments based on the expected duration of the benefit payments for our pension plans as of our annual measurement date and is subject to change each year 
our fiscal pension plan valuations utilized a weighted average discount rate of compared to used in fiscal holding all other assumptions constant  a one half percent increase or decrease in the assumed weighted average discount rate would have decreased the net periodic pension cost by approximately million or increased it by approximately million  respectively 
sfas no 
requires recognition of a minimum pension obligation if the fair value of plan assets is less than the accumulated benefit obligation abo at the end of the year 
as of march   some of the company s pension plans had abos in excess of the fair value of their respective plan assets for which we recognized an additional minimum obligation resulting in an increase in intangible assets of million and a charge to equity of million  net of tax 
based on future plan asset performance and interest rates  additional charges to equity may be required
