results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates all of these estimates and assumptions 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision that is charged to expense 
as of december   the company s allowance for loan losses was  or of the related outstanding loan receivable balance of  the allowance for loan losses is an amount that the company believes will be adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in its portfolio based on the company s evaluations of the collectibility of loans and prior loan loss experience 
factors considered by the company include actual experience  current economic trends  aging of the loan portfolio and collateral value 
during periods of economic weakness  delinquencies  defaults  repossessions and losses generally increase 
these periods may also be accompanied by decreased demand and declining values of automobiles securing outstanding loans  which weakens collateral coverage and increases the amount of a loss in the event of default 
in addition  incentives offered by the automobile industry on new cars affect the supply of used cars and the value the company may realize upon sale of repossessed automobiles 
the allowance is based on judgments and assumptions and the actual loss experience may be different 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred taxes to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
if the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment would increase income in such period 
similarly  if the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred taxes in the future  an adjustment would be charged to income in such period 
the company also records reserves for contingent tax liabilities related to potential exposure 
the company accounts for its investment in berkadia under the equity method of accounting 
although the company has no cash investment in berkadia  the company has a contingent liability resulting from its guarantee of of the third party financing provided to berkadia 
the total amount of the company s guarantee is  as of march  since the company does not expect that berkadia will suffer losses resulting in the company having to fund its guarantee obligation  no reserve has been recorded 
as of december   the carrying amount of the company s investment in the mining properties of mk gold was approximately  the recoverability of this asset is entirely dependent upon the success of mk gold s mining project at the las cruces copper deposit in the pyrite belt of spain 
mining will be subject to obtaining required permits  obtaining both debt and equity financing for the project  engineering and construction 
the market price of copper has been depressed over the past couple of years  reflecting generally weak global economic conditions 
the amount of financing that can be obtained for the project and its related cost will be significantly affected by the assessment of potential lenders of the current and expected future market price of copper 
in addition  the actual price of copper  the operating cost of the mine and the capital cost to bring the mine into production will affect the recoverability of this asset 
based on the current status of the project and mk gold s estimate of future financing costs and future cash flows  the company believes the asset is recoverable 
banking and lending finance revenues  which reflect the level and mix of consumer instalment loans  decreased in as compared to due to fewer average loans outstanding 
average loans outstanding were   and  for  and  respectively 
this decline was primarily due to the company s decision in september to stop originating subprime automobile loans 
although finance revenues decreased in as compared to  pre tax results increased primarily due to a  reduction in interest expense  due to reduced customer banking deposits and lower interest rates thereon  a net change of  in the accounting for the market values of interest rate swaps discussed below  a decline in the provision for loan losses of  and lower salaries expense and operating costs resulting from the segment s restructuring efforts 
these changes were partially offset by higher interest paid on interest rate swaps of  in  the banking and lending segment s provision for loan losses decreased as compared to the prior year primarily due to the decline in loans outstanding  although as a percent of outstanding loans it increased due to increased loss experience  particularly in the subprime automobile portfolio 
the company believes this loss experience reflects the difficulties experienced by subprime borrowers in the current economy 
at december   the allowance for loan losses for the company s entire loan portfolio was  or of the net outstanding loans  compared to  or of net outstanding loans at december  the company s remaining consumer lending programs have primarily consisted of marine  recreational vehicle  motorcycle and elective surgery loans 
due to current economic conditions  portfolio performance and the relatively small size of these loan portfolios and target markets  in january the company stopped originating all consumer loans 
the company is considering its alternatives for its banking and lending operations  which could include selling or liquidating some or all of its loan portfolios  and outsourcing certain functions 
although finance revenues increased in as compared to  pre tax results declined primarily due to a larger provision for loan losses  changes in market values of interest rate swaps  higher interest paid on interest rate swaps  charges recorded in connection with the company s decision to stop originating new subprime automobile loans and to consolidate all operations in salt lake city  and higher interest expense due to the increased customer banking deposits through september of in  the banking and lending segment s provision for loan losses increased  as compared to the prior year 
this increase primarily reflected higher net charge offs  for which the company believes a weaker economy and increased bankruptcies were contributing factors  and an increase in the rates used by the company to establish the allowance for loan losses in recognition of its increased loss experience 
pre tax results for the banking and lending segment for also included  of charges related to consolidating all operations in salt lake city 
pre tax results for the banking and lending segment include income expense of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  resulting from mark to market changes on its interest rate swaps 
the company uses interest rate swaps to manage the impact of interest rate changes on its customer banking deposits 
although the company believes that these derivative financial instruments serve as economic hedges  they do not meet certain effectiveness criteria under sfas and  therefore  are not accounted for as hedges 
manufacturing manufacturing revenues for the plastics division declined approximately in as compared to primarily due to reductions in the consumer products market of  partially offset by increases in the construction market of  the reductions in the consumer products market resulted from the loss of a customer for the asian market and for its consumer dust wipe products  and reduced demand for one of the company s healthcare products 
gross profit was largely unchanged for as compared to  reflecting cost reduction initiatives that reduced labor costs  improved material utilization and reduced non resin raw material costs 
for the year ended december   the division recorded an impairment charge of approximately  to write down the book value of certain production lines that the division does not expect will be utilized over the next several years 
these lines were initially purchased to provide additional capacity to produce a specific product for a specific customer  however  the customer discontinued the product in and the company no longer believes that the cost of these lines are currently recoverable from other business 
when the division s customer discontinued the product and terminated their contract in  they were required to pay the division a termination payment of  which was recognized as other income in the division did not record an impairment charge in since its expected production volume for these lines would have resulted in future cash flows that did not support an impairment charge at that time 
manufacturing revenues  gross profit and pre tax results for the plastics division declined in as compared to of the  decline in manufacturing revenues in  the most significant reduction was in the consumer products market  which declined by  this decline was primarily due to a customer for the asian market no longer using one of the company s products and a lower than anticipated demand for consumer dust wipe products 
in addition  increased competition in the agriculture  home furnishing and packaging markets and customer inventory reductions in the construction and certain industrial markets also contributed to the reduction in sales in gross profit for declined primarily due to the decline in sales and higher fixed costs related to the belgium manufacturing facility 
the decline in pre tax income in was partially offset by the contract termination gain referred to above 
domestic real estate revenues from domestic real estate declined in as compared to as a result of lower gains from property sales of  and less rent income of  largely due to the sale of one of the company s shopping centers in and two shopping centers during  partially offset by increased revenues from the company s hawaiian hotel  which the company began operating in the third quarter of the decline in pre tax income also reflects greater operating costs  principally related to the hawaiian hotel and a  write down of a mortgage receivable 
during the fourth quarter of  the company sold one of its real estate subsidiaries  cds  to homefed for a purchase price of  consisting of  in cash and  shares of homefed s common stock  which represents approximately of the outstanding homefed stock 
cds s principal asset is the master planned community located in san diego county  california known as san elijo hills  for which homefed has served as the development manager since the deferred gain on this sale of approximately  at december   will be recognized into income as the san elijo hills project is developed and sold 
the company is accounting for its investment in homefed under the equity method of accounting 
income recognized representing its share of homefed s earnings in was not material 
prior to the sale to homefed  the company recognized pre tax gains of  from sales of residential sites at san elijo hills during the reduction in revenues and pre tax income from domestic real estate in as compared to the prior year was principally due to the foreclosure gains recorded in and lower gains from property sales  net of costs 
during  the company sold residential sites and a school site resulting in pre tax gains of  at san elijo hills 
other investment and other income declined in as compared to principally due to reductions in gains from domestic property sales and rent income as discussed above  a reduction of  in investment income resulting from a decline in interest rates and a lower amount of invested assets  a decline of  in revenues from the company s gas operations principally due to lower production and prices  and the gain recognized in of  from the sale of the company s investment in two inactive insurance companies 
the decreases were partially offset by a  gain from the sale of certain thoroughbred racetrack businesses and increased revenues from the company s hawaiian hotel of  investment and other income declined in as compared to in part from non recurring income recognized in totaling  primarily consisting of foreclosure gains from certain domestic real estate properties of  a prepayment penalty related to certain promissory notes of  and a gain from the sale of a corporate owned aircraft of  in addition  investment and other income declined in due to decreased gains from sales of various domestic real estate properties of  and a reduction in revenues related to mk gold of  such decreases were partially offset by the gain from the sale of the company s investment in two inactive insurance companies referred to above and increased revenues from the company s oil and gas operations of  net securities gains losses for include a provision of  to write down the company s investments in certain available for sale securities and its equity investment in a non public fund 
the write down of the available for sale securities resulted from a decline in market value determined to be other than temporary 
net securities gains losses for include pre tax security gains related to the company s investments in fidelity national financial  inc  and jordan telecommunication products  inc 
for  the company recognized  of pre tax income from its equity investments in associated companies as compared to  of pre tax losses for the increase in was primarily due to income from the company s equity investment in berkadia of  as compared to a loss from this investment of  in  and  of income from the company s equity investment in olympus  an investment the company made in december these increases were partially offset by a  decline in income from its investment in jpof ii  from which the company recorded  of income in  and a loss of  from the company s equity investment in wiltel  representing the company s share of wiltel s losses under the equity method of accounting 
for  the company s equity in the income of berkadia consisted of pre tax income of  related to the amortization of the discount on the berkadia loan and  from its share of the net interest spread on the berkadia loan 
for  the company s equity in the loss of berkadia consisted of a pre tax loss of  for its share of finova s losses under the equity method of accounting   of pre tax income related to the amortization of the discount on the berkadia loan and  of pre tax income from its share of the net interest spread on the berkadia loan 
as more fully described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements  berkadia s initial investment in the finova stock and the berkadia loan are determined based upon the relative fair values of the securities received in exchange for the funds transferred to finova 
the fair value assigned to the finova stock was based upon the trading price of finova s common stock on the day the finova stock was received  was far in excess of finova s net worth and was inconsistent with the company s view that the finova common stock has a very limited value 
subsequent to acquisition  and principally as a result of the terrorist attacks on september   berkadia recorded its share of finova s losses in an amount that reduced berkadia s investment in finova s common stock to zero in the book value of the company s equity investment in berkadia was negative  and negative  at december  and  respectively 
the negative carrying amount principally results from berkadia s distribution of loan fees received and the company s recognition in of its share of finova s losses under the equity method of accounting 
this negative carrying amount is being amortized into income over the term of the berkadia loan  and effectively represents an unamortized discount on the berkadia loan 
since its acquisition in the fourth quarter of  the company has recorded its share of wiltel s losses under the equity method of accounting 
as a result of its emergence from bankruptcy proceedings and its continued restructuring of its operations  wiltel has reduced its headcount  operating costs and interest expense 
however  despite these cost reductions  the company believes that wiltel will continue to report losses from continuing operations for the foreseeable future 
even if wiltel is able to generate breakeven cash flow from operations  substantial depreciation charges will still result in losses from continuing operations over the next several years 
the company will record its share of these losses in its statements of operations  and the recognition of these losses could reduce the carrying amount of its investment in wiltel to zero 
the company will not record any further losses in wiltel if and when its investment is reduced to zero  unless the company has guaranteed any of wiltel s obligations  or otherwise has committed or intends to commit to provide further financial support 
the company has not provided any such guarantees or commitments 
for  the company recognized  of pre tax losses from its equity investments in associated companies as compared to  of pre tax income for the loss in was primarily due to a loss of  representing the company s share of the loss recorded by berkadia  as described above 
the company s loss related to berkadia was partially offset by income from other equity investments  the most significant of which related to jpof ii 
the company recognized income from its investment in jpof ii of  and  in and  respectively 
the decline in interest expense for as compared to primarily reflects lower interest expense at the banking and lending segment due to reduced customer banking deposits and lower interest rates thereon 
salaries expense in primarily reflects decreased expenses related to lower bonus expense 
selling  general and other expenses increased in as compared to the prior year primarily due to higher provisions for loan losses and charges recorded in connection with consolidating the banking and lending operations referred to above  partially offset by lower expenses related to mk gold 
income taxes for reflect the reversal of tax reserves aggregating  as a result of the favorable resolution of certain federal income tax contingencies discussed above 
income taxes for reflect a benefit of  for the favorable resolution of federal and state income tax contingencies  and in  the company s effective income tax rate did not vary materially from the expected statutory federal rate 
property and casualty insurance discontinued operation in december  upon approval by the company s board of directors to commence an orderly liquidation of the empire group  the company classified as discontinued operations the property and casualty insurance operations of the empire group 
the empire group had historically engaged in commercial and personal lines of property and casualty insurance  principally in the new york metropolitan area 
the empire group only accepts new business that it is obligated to accept by contract or new york insurance law  it does not engage in any other business activities except for its claims runoff operations 
the voluntary liquidation is expected to be substantially complete by in december  the company wrote down its investment in the empire group to its estimated net realizable value based on expected operating results and cash flows during the liquidation period  which indicated that the company is unlikely to realize any value once the liquidation is complete 
accordingly  the company recorded a  after tax charge net of taxes of  as a loss on disposal of discontinued operations to fully write off its investment 
while this estimated net realizable value represents management s best estimate  the amount the company will ultimately realize could be  but is not expected to be  greater 
the company has no obligation to contribute additional capital to the empire group

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following includes forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the company s market risk arises principally from interest rate risk related to its investment portfolio  its borrowing activities and the banking and lending activities of certain subsidiaries 
the company s investment portfolio is primarily classified as available for sale  and consequently  is recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reflected in shareholders equity 
included in the company s investment portfolio are fixed income securities  which comprised approximately of the company s total investment portfolio at december  these fixed income securities are primarily rated investment grade or are us governmental agency issued or guaranteed obligations 
the estimated weighted average remaining life of these fixed income securities was approximately years at december  the company s fixed income securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
the company s investment portfolio also includes its investment in wmig  carried at its aggregate market value of  this investment is approximately of the company s total investment portfolio  and its value is subject to change if the market value of the wmig stock rises or falls 
at december   fixed income securities comprised approximately of the company s total investment portfolio and had an estimated weighted average remaining life of years 
at december  and  the company s portfolio of trading securities was not material 
the company is subject to interest rate risk on its long term fixed interest rate debt and the company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of its subsidiary trust holding solely subordinated debt securities of the company 
generally  the fair market value of debt and preferred securities with a fixed interest rate will increase as interest rates fall  and the fair market value will decrease as interest rates rise 
the company s banking and lending operations are subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations to the extent that there is a difference between the amount of the interest earning assets and the amount of interest bearing liabilities that are prepaid withdrawn  mature or reprice in specified periods 
the principal objectives of the company s banking and lending asset liability management activities are to provide maximum levels of net interest income while maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate and liquidity risk and to facilitate funding needs 
the company utilizes an interest rate sensitivity model as the primary quantitative tool in measuring the amount of interest rate risk that is present 
the model quantifies the effects of various interest rate scenarios on the projected net interest margin over the ensuing twelve month period 
derivative financial instruments  including interest rate swaps  may be used to modify the company s indicated net interest sensitivity to levels deemed to be appropriate based on risk management policies and the company s current economic outlook 
counterparties to such agreements are major financial institutions  which the company believes are able to fulfill their obligations  however  if they are not  the company believes that any losses are unlikely to be material
