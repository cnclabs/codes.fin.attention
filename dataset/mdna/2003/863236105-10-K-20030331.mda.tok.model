background and overview we are an education services holding company that owns strayer university and education loan processing  inc elp 
the university is an institution of higher education which as of december   offered undergraduate and graduate degree programs at campuses in maryland  virginia  north carolina and washington  dc and worldwide through strayer university online 
elp administers strayer s education loan programs 
in may  we issued million of series a convertible redeemable preferred stock 
we used the million  together with approximately million of cash and marketable securities  to repurchase  shares of our outstanding common stock through a tender offer open to all shareholders 
as our common stock subsequently traded above per share  only our then chief executive officer and majority stockholder tendered at per share which he had agreed to do by contract 
as set forth below  enrollment measured by fall term to fall term  full time tuition rates  revenues  operating income and net income have all increased in each of the last three years 
year ended december  in thousands  except percentage  enrollment  tuition per credit hour and earnings per share data fall term enrollment    change from prior year full time tuition per credit hour change from prior year revenues    change from prior year operating income    change from prior year net income    change from prior year diluted earnings per share change from prior year strayer university derives over of its revenue from tuition collected from its students 
the academic year of the university is divided into four quarters  which approximately coincide with the four quarters of the calendar year 
students make payment arrangements for the tuition for each course prior to the beginning of the quarter 
when students register for courses  tuition is recorded as unearned tuition  which is recognized as courses are taught through the academic quarter 
if a student withdraws from a course prior to completion  the university refunds a portion of the tuition depending on when the withdrawal occurs 
the university also derives revenue from various fees such as application fees  placement examination fees and no show fees related to students who fail to attend a course and do not officially withdraw 
beginning in  the university contracted out its bookstore operations to a third party 
strayer university records tuition receivable when students register for the academic quarter  generally prior to the end of the previous academic quarter 
because the university s academic quarters coincide with the calendar quarters  tuition receivable at the end of any calendar quarter largely represents student tuition due for the following academic quarter 
based upon past experience and judgment  the university establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts with respect to accounts receivable not included in unearned tuition 
any uncollected account more than six months past due is charged against the allowance 
our bad debt expense as a percentage of revenue for the years ended december   and was  and  respectively 
strayer university s expenses consist of instruction and educational support expenses  selling and promotion expenses  and general and administration expenses 
instruction and educational support expenses generally contain items of expense directly attributable to the educational activity of the university

general and administration expenses include salaries and benefits of employees engaged in management  student services  accounting  human resources  compliance and other business functions  along with the occupancy costs attributable to such functions

critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with the generally accepted accounting principles of the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments related to its allowance for uncollectible accounts  reserves for student loan losses  income tax provisions  valuation of deferred tax assets  and accrued expenses 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments regarding the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes that the following critical accounting policies are its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
tuition income is deferred at the time of registration and is recognized as income  net of any refunds or withdrawals  throughout each respective quarter session 
advance registrations for the next quarter are recorded as unearned tuition 
we record estimates for our allowance for uncollectible accounts for tuition receivable from students and for loan loss reserves from student loans granted 
if the financial condition of our students were to deteriorate  resulting in impairment of their ability to make required payments for tuition or loans payable to us  additional allowances and loan reserves may be required 
we record estimates for our accrued expenses and income tax liabilities 
should actual results differ from our estimates  revisions to our accrued expenses and income tax liabilities may be required
