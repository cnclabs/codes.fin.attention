item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements  including statements about our beliefs and expectations 
there are many risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
potential factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in any forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  those stated below under the headings cautionary statement concerning forward looking statements and risk factors as well as those described from time to time in our filings with the securities and exchange commission 
all forward looking statements are based on information available to us on the date of this filing  and we assume no obligation to update such statements 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our filings with the securities and exchange commission and the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
overview costar is the leading provider of information services to the commercial real estate industry in the united states and the united kingdom 
we have created a standardized information platform where the members of the commercial real estate and related business community can continuously interact and facilitate transactions by efficiently exchanging accurate and standardized commercial real estate information 
our wide array of online service offerings includes a leasing marketplace  a selling marketplace  comparable sales information  decision support  tenant information  property marketing  data hosting for clients web sites  contact management  property data integration and industry news 
we completed our initial public offering in july   and received net proceeds of approximately million 
we primarily used those net proceeds to fund the geographic and service expansion of our business  including three strategic acquisitions  and to expand our sales and marketing organization 
in may   we completed a follow on public offering and received net proceeds of approximately million 
we used a portion of those net proceeds to fund the acquisitions of comps 
com  inc comps and property intelligence plc property intelligence and we expect to use the remainder of the proceeds primarily for development and distribution of new services  expansion of all existing services across our current markets  geographic expansion in the us and international markets  strategic acquisitions  working capital and general corporate purposes 
from through the beginning of  we expanded the geographical coverage of our existing services and developed new services 
in addition to internal growth  this expansion included the acquisitions of chicago resource  inc in chicago in and new market systems  inc 
in san francisco in in august   we expanded into the houston region through the acquisition of houston based real estate information provider c data services  inc in january   we expanded further into the midwest and florida by acquiring leasetrend  inc and into atlanta and dallas fort worth by acquiring jamison research  inc in september   we acquired ares development group  llc  a los angeles based developer and distributor of ares for act in february   we acquired comps  a san diego based provider of commercial real estate information 
in november   we acquired first image technologies  inc first image 
in september   we expanded further into portland through the acquisition of certain of the assets of napier realty advisors d b a real net real net 
in january   we established a base in the united kingdom with our acquisition of london based property intelligence 
the more recent acquisitions are discussed later in this section 
since our inception  the growth of our business has required substantial investments for the expansion of our services and the establishment of operating regions throughout the united states  which has resulted in substantial net losses on an overall basis 
throughout and  we experienced a rapid expansion in the number of services that we offer and the number of regions in which we operate 
by the beginning of  we had substantially completed our goal of establishing a national platform of operating regions and service offerings in us market areas from which we believe we can appropriately meet the commercial real estate community s needs for comprehensive us building specific information 
during and  we focused on continuing to grow revenue while controlling and reducing costs  in order to reduce operating losses  and ultimately  move our business to profitability 
on an ongoing basis  we believe that the opportunity to continue to grow revenue from our existing platform and services is significant and that a large component of the operating cost structure of the company is made up of fixed operating costs 
during  the company increased pro forma net income  which represents our net loss in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap after excluding purchase amortization in cost of revenues  purchase amortization in operating expenses and the related income tax benefit  by million from a pro forma net loss of million in to pro forma net income of million in in addition  the company increased ebitda by million from negative ebitda of million in to positive ebitda of million in also  the company s gaap net loss decreased from million in to million in our use of non gaap financial measures is discussed later in this section 
these results do not include the property intelligence acquisition  which was completed on january  by combining property intelligence s operations with costar s operations and our expected organic growth  costar expects revenue to grow significantly over revenue 
in addition  we expect pro forma net income to significantly increase over pro forma net income 
we also expect to achieve gaap basis earnings by the end of if the company achieves gaap basis earnings  the company s diluted net income per share may be lower than its basic net income per share if any of the company s outstanding stock options have an exercise price lower than the average market price of our common stock for any period in which we report gaap net income 
with the achievement of the expected results  we believe we can maintain positive cash flow from operations throughout in addition  we expect to achieve tax basis earnings in  which may result in us utilizing some of our net operating loss carryforwards 
to the extent we are not able to utilize these net operating loss carryforwards  we may incur an income tax expense during we continue to develop and distribute new services and expand existing services across our current regions 
the incremental cost of introducing new services and expanding existing services in the future may reduce the profitability of a region or cause it to incur losses 
in addition  we may continue our geographic expansion in the united states or we may seek additional international geographic expansion 
therefore  while we expect current service offerings in existing regions to remain generally profitable and provide substantial funding for our overall business  it is possible that further overall expansion could cause us to generate additional losses and negative cash flow from operations in the future 
while our services continue to expand  our costar property  costar tenant and costar comps services currently generate the largest portion of our revenue 
the costar property  costar tenant and costar comps subscription contracts generally have terms of one to three years and renew automatically 
upon renewal  many of the contract rates increase in accordance with contract provisions or as a result of contract renegotiations 
to encourage clients to use our services regularly  we generally charge fixed amounts rather than fees based on actual system usage 
we charge our clients based on the number of sites  organization size  the client s business focus and the number of services to which a client subscribes 
prior to  our contract renewal rate historically had exceeded on an annual basis 
for the year ended december   our renewal rate decreased to as a result of the downturn in general economic conditions  together with cancellations by many telecommunications companies 
however  for the year ended december   our contract renewal rate increased to over of our revenues arise from clients under subscription contracts 
our subscription clients pay contract fees on an annual  quarterly or monthly basis 
we recognize this revenue over the life of the contract on a straight line basis beginning with the installation or renewal date 
annual and quarterly advance payments result in deferred revenue  substantially reducing the working capital requirements generated by accounts receivable 
we applied the new rules on accounting for goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives beginning in the first quarter of in accordance with financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but are subject to annual impairment tests 
other intangible assets continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
during the second quarter of  we completed the initial impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  which did not indicate an impairment loss 
the effect of the new rules decreased amortization expense related to goodwill by approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the previous year 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the period reported 
the following accounting policies involve a critical accounting estimate because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made 
in addition  while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time  different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period 
changes in the accounting estimates we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
we review these estimates and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period that they are determined to be necessary 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we assess the impairment of long lived assets  identifiable intangibles and goodwill through our annual impairment tests or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  or significant decline in our market capitalization relative to net book value for a sustained period 
when we determine that the carrying value may not be recovered based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure and assess the temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue or deductibility of certain intangible assets  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe the recovery is not reasonably assured  we must establish a valuation allowance 
going forward  we will assess the continued need for the valuation allowance 
after we have determined that we will be able to begin utilizing a significant portion of the deferred tax assets  we may reverse the valuation allowance  resulting in a benefit to the statement of operations in some future period 
accounting for employee stock options as permitted under statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  we account for employee stock options in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
under apb no 
 we recognize compensation cost based on the intrinsic value of the equity instrument awarded as determined at the measurement date 
we disclose the required pro forma information in our notes to consolidated financial statements as if the fair value method prescribed by sfas no 
had been applied 
non gaap financial measures we prepare and release quarterly unaudited financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap 
we also disclose and discuss certain non gaap financial measures included in quarterly earnings releases  investor conference calls and filings with the securities and exchange commission 
these non gaap financial measures include pro forma net income  which we have determined by excluding purchase amortization in cost of revenues  purchase amortization in operating expenses  acquired in process development and the related income tax benefit from our gaap net loss  and ebitda  which is our income from continuing operations before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
we believe the disclosure of pro forma net income and ebitda helps investors more meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our ongoing operations from quarter to quarter and from year to year because it more clearly indicates our ongoing operating results  particularly as they relate to our operating cash flows 
management also uses these numbers to internally measure its operating and management performance and uses pro forma net income as one of several criteria to determine the achievement of performance based cash bonuses 
however  we urge investors to carefully review the gaap financial information included as part of our quarterly reports on form q and our annual reports on form k that are filed with the securities and exchange commission  as well as our quarterly earnings releases  and compare the gaap financial information with our pro forma net income and ebitda 
in the future  we may disclose other non gaap financial measures in order to help our investors more meaningfully evaluate and compare our future results of operations to our previously reported results of operations 
the following table shows our pro forma net income and our ebitda reconciled to our gaap net loss for the indicated periods in thousands of dollars year ended december  net loss purchase amortization in cost of revenues purchase amortization in operating expenses acquired in process development income tax benefit pro forma net income loss pro forma net income loss depreciation and other amortization interest income  net ebitda consolidated results of operations the following table provides our selected consolidated results of operations for the indicated periods in thousands of dollars and as a percentage of total revenue year ended december  revenues cost of revenues gross margin operating expenses selling and marketing software development general and administrative purchase amortization acquired in process development total operating expenses loss from operations other income  net income tax benefit net loss comparison of year ended december  and year ended december  revenues

 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets

the effect of the new rules decreased amortization expense related to goodwill by approximately million for as compared to other income  net 
interest and other income decreased from million in to  in this decrease was primarily a result of lower total cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances and lower interest rates during the year

on february   we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of comps  a san diego based provider of commercial real estate information  for million in cash and  shares of the company s common stock 
the acquisition has been accounted for using purchase accounting and has been valued at approximately million for accounting purposes 
the purchase price was allocated primarily to cash of million  and acquired database technology and other intangibles  which are being amortized over a period of to years 
in connection with the purchase of comps  million of the purchase price was allocated to purchased in process development  and expensed upon acquisition because the technological feasibility of products under development had not been established and no future alternative use existed 
the acquired in process development was analyzed through an independent third party valuation using the expected cash flow approach

the purchase price was allocated primarily to acquired database technology and customer base  which will be amortized over a period of five years 
property intelligence plc 
on january   we acquired the share capital of london based property intelligence for the us dollar equivalent of approximately million in cash paid to the owners of the share capital and approximately  in cash  net of exercise proceeds  paid to the option holders of property intelligence who simultaneously exercised their options with the closing of the acquisition 
the acquisition has been accounted for using purchase accounting

the acquired database technology and customer base will be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
goodwill will not be amortized  but is subject to annual impairment tests 
property intelligence  whose operations principally consist of focus information  is a leading provider of information services to the commercial real estate and related business community in the united kingdom 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
total cash and cash equivalents  cash held for acquisition and short term investments were million at december   an increase of million from million at december  our cash and cash equivalents balance was million and million  and our short term investments balance was million and million at december  and  respectively 
at december   we had million of cash allocated for the acquisition of london based property intelligence  which was paid out in conjunction with the closing of this acquisition on january  the increase in cash and cash equivalents  cash held for acquisition and short term investments in over was due principally to cash provided from operating activities and the exercise of stock options offset by million in purchases of property and equipment  a cash payment of  paid in connection with the completion of one of the earn out provisions relating to the acquisition of first image and a cash payment of  in consideration for the acquisition of certain of the assets of real net 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million compared to net cash used in operating activities of million for the year ended december  this million increase in net cash provided by operating activities was principally the result of revenue growth and reductions in operating expenses  both of which contributed to a reduction of our net loss for compared to net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to net cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended december  this increase in net cash used in investing activities during was principally due to an increase in purchases of property and equipment 
we have entered into numerous operating leases for office space throughout the country  including our headquarters  and as of december  had annual commitments for total rent payments ranging from million to  over the next eight years 
during the third and fourth quarters of  we completed our planned relocation of our san diego office and incurred capital expenditures of approximately million 
to date  we have grown in part by acquiring other companies and we may continue to make acquisitions 
our acquisitions may vary in size and could be material to our current operations 
we expect to use cash  stock  debt or other means of funding to make these acquisitions 
based on current plans  we believe that our available cash combined with positive cash flow provided by operating activities should be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months 
although we have experienced net losses to date  we expect to achieve tax basis earnings in once we have determined that we will be able to begin utilizing a significant portion of our deferred tax assets  we expect to offset any income tax liability related to our tax basis earnings with our net operating loss carryforwards 
in future periods  to the extent we are not able to offset our taxable income by the benefits of our net operating loss carryforwards  we would incur an income tax charge to our consolidated statement of operations 
we do not believe the impact of inflation has significantly affected our operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued sfas no

our forward looking statements are also identified by words such as believes  expects  anticipates  intends  estimates or similar expressions 
you should understand that these forward looking statements are necessarily estimates reflecting our judgment  not guarantees of future performance 
they are subject to a number of assumptions  risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements 
you should understand that the following important factors  in addition to those discussed in risk factors  could affect our future results and could cause those results or other outcomes to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward looking statements general economic conditions  customer retention  competition  the company s ability to control costs  changes or consolidations within the commercial real estate industry  release of new and upgraded products by the company or our competitors  data quality  development of our sales force  employee retention  technical problems with our products  managerial execution  changes in relationships with real estate brokers and other strategic partners  foreign currency fluctuations  legal and regulatory issues  changes in accounting policies or practices  and successful adoption of and training on our products 
accordingly  you should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date of this report 
all subsequent written and oral forward looking statements attributable to us or any person acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section 
we do not undertake any obligation to release publicly any revisions to these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
risk factors our future profitability is uncertain 
to date  we have not recorded an overall operating profit because the investment required for geographic expansion and new services has caused our expenses to exceed our profits 
our ability to earn a profit will largely depend on our ability to manage our growth  and to generate revenues that exceed our expenses 
in addition  our ability to earn a profit  to increase revenues or to control costs could be affected by the factors set forth below 
we may not be able to generate revenues or control expenses sufficient to earn a profit  to maintain profits on a quarterly or annual basis  or to sustain or increase our future revenue growth 
our operating results may fluctuate significantly 
our operating results  revenues and expenses may fluctuate with general economic conditions and also for many other reasons  such as cancellations or non renewals of our products  competition  our ability to control expenses  loss of clients or revenues  changes or consolidation in the real estate industry  the timing and success of new service introductions and enhancements  the development of our sales force  managerial execution  data quality  employee retention  foreign currency fluctuations  our investments in geographic expansion  successful adoption of and training on the company s products  the timing of investing the net proceeds from our offerings  acquisitions of other companies or assets  sales  brand enhancement and marketing promotional activities  client training and support activities  changes in client budgets  or our investments in other corporate resources 
in addition  changes in accounting policies or practices may affect our results of operations  including without limitation  changes requiring us to expense stock options 
we may not be able to attract and retain clients 
our success and revenues depend on attracting and retaining subscribers to our services 
the costar property  costar tenant and costar comps subscription contracts  which generate the largest portion of our revenue  generally range from terms of one to three years 
our clients may decide not to renew or to cancel their agreements as a result of several factors  including a decision that they have no need for our products  a decision to use alternative products  pricing and budgetary constraints  consolidation in the real estate industry  data quality  technical problems  or economic or competitive pressures 
in addition  if we do not maintain adequate training and support levels  we could experience reduced demand for our services 
if clients decide not to renew or cancel their agreements  and we do not attract new clients  then our revenues will be adversely affected 
our operating costs may be higher than we expect 
many of our expenses  particularly personnel costs and occupancy costs  are relatively fixed 
as a result  we may not be able to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected revenue shortfall or increase in expenses 
additionally  we may experience higher than expected operating costs  including increased personnel costs  selling and marketing costs  investments in geographic expansion  acquisition costs  occupancy costs  communications costs  travel costs  software development costs  outside services costs and other costs 
if operating costs exceed our expectations or cannot be adjusted accordingly  our business  results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected 
competition could render our services uncompetitive 
the market for information systems and services in general is highly competitive and rapidly changing 
our existing competitors  or potential new competitors  may have greater name recognition  larger customer bases  better technology or data  lower prices  easier access to data  greater user traffic or greater financial  technical or marketing resources than we have 
our competitors may be able to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns  obtain more data  adopt more aggressive pricing policies  make more attractive offers to potential employees  subscribers  distribution partners and content providers or may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or changes in user requirements 
increased competition could result in lower revenues and higher expenses  which would reduce our profitability 
continued downturn or consolidation in the commercial real estate industry may have an adverse effect on our business 
currently  the commercial real estate industry is in a weakened state  as evidenced by higher vacancy rates and lower leasing activity  rental rates and absorption rates 
a depressed commercial real estate market has a negative impact on our core customer base and adversely affects our business 
a continuation of the weak commercial real estate business may continue to affect our ability to generate new sales and may lead to more cancellations by our current or future customers  both of which would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and our results of operations 
also  companies in this industry are consolidating  often in order to reduce expenses 
consolidation may lead to more cancellations of our services by our customers  reduce the number of our existing clients  reduce the size of our target market  or increase our clients bargaining power  all of which would have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations 
general economic conditions could have an adverse effect on our business 
our business and the commercial real estate industry are particularly affected by negative trends in the general economy 
the success of our business depends on a number of factors relating to general global  national  regional and local economic conditions  including inflation  interest rates  perceived and actual economic conditions  taxation policies  availability of credit  employment levels  and wage and salary levels 
the current negative state of the economy  and the commercial real estate industry in particular  has had a negative impact on our business 
any continuation of these negative general economic conditions could adversely affect our business 
additionally  any war in which the united states is involved or any significant terrorist attack is likely to have a dampening effect on the economy in general which could affect our financial performance and our stock price 
in addition  a significant increase in inflation could increase our expenses  which may not be offset by increased revenues 
if clients choose to cancel our services as a result of economic conditions  and we do not acquire new clients  our financial position would be adversely affected 
international expansion may result in new business risks 
our international expansion could subject us to new business risks  including adapting to the differing business practices and laws in foreign commercial real estate markets  difficulties in managing foreign operations  limited protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods  costs of enforcing contractual obligations  impact of recessions in economies outside the united states  currency exchange rate fluctuations  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
in addition  international expansion imposes additional burdens on our executive and administrative personnel  systems development  research and sales departments  and general managerial resources 
if we are not able to manage our expanded growth successfully  it could have a material adverse effect on our profitability 
finally  the investment required for international expansion could exceed the profit generated from such expansion  which could adversely affect our financial condition 
fluctuating foreign currencies may negatively impact our business  results of operations and financial condition 
as a result of the property intelligence acquisition  a portion of our business is denominated in the british pound and as such fluctuations in foreign currencies may have an impact on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
this currency may be affected by internal factors  and external developments in other countries  all of which can have an adverse impact on a country s currency 
currently  we do not have any hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations 
we may seek to enter hedging transactions in the future but we may be unable to enter into these transactions successfully or at all 
we cannot predict whether foreign exchange losses will be incurred in the future  and significant foreign exchange fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we may not be able to successfully introduce new products or upgraded products 
our future business and financial success will depend on our ability to continue to introduce new products and upgraded products into the marketplace 
to be successful  we must adapt to rapid technological changes by continually enhancing our products and services 
developing new products and upgrades to products imposes heavy burdens on our systems development department  product managers  management and researchers 
this process is costly and we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully develop and enhance our services and products 
in addition  successfully launching and selling a new product  such as web based costar property  puts pressure on our sales and marketing resources 
if we are unable to develop new products or upgrades to our products  then our customers may choose a competitive service over ours and our business may be adversely affected 
in addition  if we incur significant costs in developing new products or upgrades to our products  are not successful in marketing and selling these new products or upgrades or our customers fail to accept these new products  it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
if we are not able to obtain and maintain accurate  comprehensive or reliable data  our business could be harmed 
our success depends on our clients confidence in the comprehensiveness  accuracy and reliability of the data we provide 
the task of establishing and maintaining accurate and reliable data is challenging 
if our data is not current  accurate  comprehensive or reliable  we could experience reduced demand for our services or legal claims by our customers  which could result in lower revenues and higher expenses 
in addition  we license some of our data  images and technology from public records providers and other third party suppliers to enhance our products and services 
if we are unable to enter into licensing agreements with these entities  if the data  images or technology becomes unavailable for any reason  or if the costs for these products rise  we could experience increased costs or less comprehensive data or technology  which could harm our business 
if we are unable to hire  retain and continue to develop our sales force  it could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in order to support revenue growth  we need to continue to develop  train and retain our sales force 
our ability to build and develop a strong sales force may be affected by a number of factors  including our ability to integrate and motivate sales personnel  our ability to effectively train our sales force  the ability of our sales force to sell an increased number of products  the length of time it takes new sales personnel to become productive  the competition we face from other companies in hiring and retaining sales personnel  and our ability to manage a multi location sales organization 
if we are unable to hire  develop or retain the members of our sales force  or if our sales force is unproductive  it could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and expenses 
our business depends on retaining and attracting highly capable management and operating personnel 
our success depends in large part on our ability to retain and attract management and operating personnel  including our president and chief executive officer  andrew florance  our officers and other key employees 
our business requires highly skilled technical  sales  management  web development  marketing and research personnel  who are in high demand and are often subject to competing offers 
to retain and attract key personnel  we use various measures  including employment agreements  a stock option plan and incentive bonuses for key executive officers 
these measures may not be enough to retain and attract the personnel we need or to offset the impact on our business of the loss of the services of mr 
florance or other key officers or employees 
if we do not generate sufficient cash flows from operations  we may need additional capital 
to date  we have financed our operations through cash generated from operations of our profitable regions  the sale of our stock and borrowing money 
if we do not generate enough cash from operations to finance our business in the future  we will need to raise additional funds through public or private financing 
selling additional equity securities could dilute the equity interests of our stockholders 
if we borrow money  we will have to pay interest and agree to restrictions that may limit our operating flexibility 
we may not be able to obtain funds needed to finance our operations at all or may be able to obtain funds only on unattractive terms 
if we require additional funds and are not able to obtain such funds  it would have a material adverse effect on our operations 
technical problems that affect our customers use or access to our products could have an adverse effect on our business 
our business increasingly depends upon the satisfactory performance  reliability and availability of our web site  the internet and our service providers 
problems with our web site  the internet or the services provided by our local exchange carriers or internet service providers could result in slower connections for our customers or interfere with our customers access to our products 
if we experience technical problems in distributing our products  we could experience reduced demand for our products 
in addition  the software underlying our services is complex and may contain undetected errors 
despite testing  we cannot be certain that errors will not be found in our software 
any errors could result in adverse publicity  impaired use of our services  loss of revenues  cost increases and legal claims by customers 
all these factors could seriously damage our business  operating results and financial condition 
temporary or permanent outages of our computers  software or telecommunications equipment could have an adverse effect on our business 
our operations depend on our ability to protect our database  computers and software  telecommunications equipment and facilities against damage from potential dangers such as fire  power loss  security breaches and telecommunications failures 
any temporary or permanent loss of one or more of these systems or facilities from an accident  equipment malfunction or some other cause could harm our business 
if we experience a failure that results in our not being able to deliver our products to clients  or to update our products  we could experience reduced demand for our products 
we may be unable to enforce or defend our ownership and use of intellectual property 
the success of our business depends in large part on the intellectual property involved in our methodologies  database  products and software 
we rely on a combination of trade secret  patent  copyright and other laws  nondisclosure and noncompetition provisions  license agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights 
however  current law may not provide for adequate protection of our databases and the actual data 
in addition  legal standards relating to the validity  enforceability and scope of protection of proprietary rights in internet related businesses are uncertain and evolving  and we cannot assure you of the future viability or value of any of our proprietary rights 
our business could be significantly harmed if we are not able to protect our content and our other intellectual property 
the same would be true if a court found that our services infringe other persons intellectual property rights 
any intellectual property lawsuits in which we are involved  either as a plaintiff or as a defendant  could cost us a significant amount of time and money and distract management s attention from operating our business 
in addition  if any intellectual property claims are adversely determined  this could result in a change to our methodology or products and could have a material adverse result on our financial position and our business 
we may be subject to legal liability for displaying or distributing information 
because the content in our database is distributed to others  we may be subject to claims for defamation  negligence or copyright or trademark infringement or claims based on other theories 
we could also be subject to claims based upon the content that is accessible from our web site through links to other web sites or information on our web site supplied by third parties 
even if these claims do not result in liability to us  we could incur significant costs in investigating and defending against any claims 
our potential liability for information distributed by us to others could require us to implement measures to reduce our exposure to liability  which may require the expenditure of substantial resources and limit the attractiveness of our service to users 
litigation in which we become involved or newly adopted laws and regulations may adversely affect our business 
currently and from time to time  we are involved in litigation incidental to the conduct of our business 
we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient insurance to cover our pending claims or our future claims 
any lawsuits in which we are involved could cost us a significant amount of time and money 
if any pending claims or future claims are adversely determined  they could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in addition  governments in the united states or abroad could adopt laws that could harm our business  for example  by regulating the information we provide or regulating our transmissions over the internet  or exposing our business to taxes in various jurisdictions 
compliance with any such laws could increase our costs or make our products less attractive 
market volatility may have an adverse effect on our stock price 
the trading price of our common stock has fluctuated widely in the past  and we expect that it will continue to fluctuate in the future 
the price could fluctuate widely based on numerous factors  including quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  changes in analysts estimates of our earnings  announcements by us or our competitors of technological innovations or new services  general conditions in the commercial real estate industry  developments or disputes concerning copyrights or proprietary rights  regulatory developments  and economic or other factors 
in addition  in recent years  the stock market in general  and the shares of internet related and other technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme price fluctuations 
this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not have significant exposure to market risks associated with changes in interest rates related to cash equivalent securities held as of december  we have a substantial amount of intangible assets 
although as of december  we believe our intangible assets will be recoverable  changes in the economy  the business in which we operate and our own relative performance could change the assumptions used to evaluate intangible asset recoverability 
in the event that we determine that an asset has been impaired  we would recognize an impairment charge for the excess amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the asset 
we continue to monitor these assumptions and their effect on the estimated recoverability of our intangible assets 
we did not have significant exposure to foreign currency risk associated with fluctuations in foreign currencies as of december  on january   we acquired the share capital of london based property intelligence 
property intelligence is a leading provider of information services to the commercial real estate and related business community in the united kingdom 
our functional currency for our operations in the united kingdom is the local currency 
as such  fluctuations in the british pound may have an impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may seek to enter hedging transactions in the future to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations  but we may be unable to enter into hedging transactions successfully or at all
