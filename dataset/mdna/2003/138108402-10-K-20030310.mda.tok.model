cash flow from operating activities for the year ended november  was  a decrease of  over fiscal the reduction in operating cash flow from was due in large part to the reduced levels of operating profitability from each of the subsidiaries

the value added hardware reseller segment saw revenues decline by  
training and consulting revenues exclusive of usertech canterbury declined by  from fiscal levels 
software development revenues experienced a reduction of  during fiscal technical staffing revenues for fiscal were  lower than the previous year 
part of this reduction was the direct result of closing the atlanta office which had been operating at a loss for a large portion of fiscal and early the declining revenue in all of the operating segments is the result of reduced client spending in all phases of information technology and training 
budgets have been reduced or eliminated 
projects have been delayed or reduced in scope 
many businesses are attempting to use internal resources instead of outsourcing in an attempt to save money during these difficult economic times 
the company is dealing with this business downturn in a number of ways 
facility consolidations  workforce reductions in areas other than sales  salary freezes and reductions  and the hiring of more sales personnel are all being utilized as a means to preserve cash and to increase revenues and cash flow 
calc canterbury has reduced its fixed overhead by sharing its parsippany  new jersey facility with both dmi canterbury and usertech canterbury 
as a subsequent event  during february  calc canterbury executed a licensing agreement with executrain  an international learning solutions provider  whereby it will become part of their global training network 
as a result  calc canterbury can now offer national and international training delivery to its existing clients with multiple locations 
the alliance will also allow calc canterbury to market itself to new clients who have not used them in the past due to its lack of national training capability 
calc canterbury is currently in search of qualified sales personnel to help expand its presence in the metro new york city marketplace 
usertech canterbury experienced a significant downturn in revenues during the last quarter of fiscal several large projects ended during the quarter and were not replaced with new business 
many clients delayed or cancelled large scale training projects due to their own poor operating results 
many of usertech canterbury s consultants were under utilized during the quarter 
as the softness in revenue has continued into the early part of fiscal  the company has taken several significant steps to preserve cash flow 
first  the saddlebrook  new jersey office was closed in december  and those employees were relocated to parsippany  new jersey to share office space with calc canterbury 
the company saved approximately  annually by not renewing the saddlebrook lease 
there was also a significant workforce reduction during the first quarter of twenty seven employees have been laid off resulting in annual salary and benefits savings of approximately  as a result of this staff reduction  the usertech canterbury s organization was restructured and streamlined resulting in additional savings 
usertech canterbury is also searching for two additional account executives in order to reach more potential customers on a national basis 
usertech canterbury also plans to offer its learning solutions through the executrain national franchise network as a result of the agreement between calc canterbury and executrain 
executrain has been planning to expand its product offerings in the erp market and usertech canterbury can now provide quality delivery and service to the client base that executrain currently services 
usc canterbury has been dealing with a number of business issues as a result of the hewlett packard compaq merger 
lower margins  more competition and delays in product availability have all taken its toll on revenues and gross profit 
margins in fiscal were compared to approximately in fiscal many manufacturer rebate programs have been discontinued 
usc canterbury is attempting to expand its reseller relationships to manufacturers other than hewlett packard and compaq in order to provide customers with more purchasing options as well as to reduce its dependence on a sole source for product 
the majority of usc canterbury s clients are municipalities in state and local government 
with many state budgets running at a deficit  there is less money being allocated to information technology spending 
usc canterbury continues to focus on expanding its business to commercial clients to reduce its overall dependence on government clients 
msi canterbury s management and sales training tends to be a more discretionary expenditure by its clients during difficult economic times 
many clients have reduced or eliminated certain programs for the time being 
over the past thirty years of its existence msi canterbury has experienced the ebb and flow caused by current economic conditions 
while dealing with the current downturn  this subsidiary has taken several steps to address the situation 
first  msi canterbury has expanded its reach by entering into several alliance programs with local chambers of commerce 
there have been reductions in support staff and consultants  while at the same time an ongoing search for qualified sales personnel is being conducted 
msi canterbury also plans to offer its services through the executrain national network in conjunction with the agreement between calc canterbury and executrain 
msi canterbury is also developing distance learning products to complement its live delivery platform 
atm canterbury has also experienced declining revenues caused in large part to the downturn in spending for information technology products as a result of poor economic conditions in the country 
new products are being developed in an effort to penetrate markets that were previously not addressed 
lower priced versions of various software packages are being introduced to new clients who have less demanding performance requirements 
atm canterbury continues to search for strategic partners who will use their software as an integral component in a packaged solution for asset tracking or document tracking and retrieval 
dmi canterbury s revenues have been adversely affected by the poor economic condition of many of the industries that it serves 
a lack of information technology job openings coupled with a surplus of it professionals has resulted in the reduction in revenue 
in order to combat this difficult operating environment  dmi canterbury has established various strategic alliances with major staffing providers who have significant relationships with large customers who are still utilizing outsourced labor 
as the economy improves  it is the company s belief that dmi canterbury will be among the first subsidiaries to experience an increase in revenues as the pool of qualified available labor diminishes and job requirements increase 
the company continues to advocate and promote cross marketing between all of its operating subsidiaries 
during the current economic downturn  the number of opportunities for canterbury to provide an all inclusive technology or training solution to its substantial customer list has been limited 
all of the subsidiaries continue to present the full complement of canterbury products and services to their clients 
it is management s belief that when business conditions improve  the company will inherit markets that have been abandoned by competitors who have gone out of business  or who do not have sufficient working capital to take advantage of future opportunities 
costs and expenses total costs and expenses increased by  in fiscal versus this increase is the result of owning usertech canterbury for a full twelve months in fiscal versus only three months in gross profit on service revenue declined from in fiscal to in due to the effects of the revenue decline from training and consulting coupled with a fairly high fixed cost delivery component 
product margins  which include hardware and software sales of the company decreased to in from in fiscal this reduction in gross profit is the result of several factors 
first  many of the manufacturer s rebate programs have been eliminated as competitive pricing pressures have forced them to be more cost efficient 
also  in the economy s current state  pricing to customers has become much more competitive 
many clients are seeking out lowest price instead of best overall solution value 
consolidated gross margins for the company decreased to in versus in fiscal reduced consultant utilization in the training and consulting business segment and significantly reduced margins on hardware as a by product of the hewlett packard compaq merger contributed to the overall margin decline 
selling expense decreased by  in fiscal versus this reduction was the result of several factors 
first  usertech canterbury s selling expense increased by  because it was owned by canterbury for a full twelve months in fiscal versus only three months in fiscal offsetting this increase were reductions in commission expense of  in usc canterbury due to a much lower gross profit level in fiscal dmi canterbury closed its atlanta facility in early fiscal resulting in a net selling expense savings of  for the year due to the reduction in sales staff 
reductions in staff at calc canterbury during fiscal resulted in approximately  in savings and more efficient direct marketing expenditures saved over  in fiscal over various other cost reductions in marketing expense and personnel in the other operating units accounted for additional savings of approximately  general and administrative expense was reduced by  in fiscal as compared to fiscal this relatively small change is again the result of various significant factors 
first  usertech canterbury s general and administrative expense increased by  due to the fact it was part of canterbury for the full year in fiscal as compared to only three months in fiscal offsetting this increase was a  reduction in goodwill amortization expense in fiscal based on the change in accounting predicated by sfas bad debt expense was reduced by  in fiscal over fiscal  based on the reduced requirements for additional reserves on lower accounts receivable balances 
lower expenses for accounting and other public company expenses saved  in fiscal over calc canterbury reduced personnel costs by approximately  in fiscal by consolidating functions and streamlining other administrative processes 
and finally  dmi canterbury reduced its general and administrative expenses by  due primarily to the closing of the atlanta office in early fiscal various other reductions in personnel related expenses totaled  as a subsequent event  on march  canterbury s corporate management team  inclusive of the chairman  president and vice president  has voluntarily reduced their present salaries by 
this is in line with a recently instituted salary reduction at one of the company s largest subsidiaries 
other income for fiscal represents the  in insurance proceeds paid to the company  related to business interruption caused by terrorist attacks on september  in fiscal the charge to other expense of  was due mainly to a loss of  related to the sale of real estate during the second quarter of fiscal critical accounting policies goodwill as previously stated  the company adopted sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets as of december  this standard requires that goodwill no longer be amortized  but instead  be tested for impairment on a periodic basis 
in fiscal  the company recorded  in goodwill impairment charges related to its msi canterbury subsidiary as a result of the continued reduction in demand for sales and management training during the current economic downturn 
this charge was recorded in the fourth quarter of the year and is reported under training and consulting in the segment reporting footnote for fiscal the current carrying value of goodwill for msi canterbury  after the impairment charge  is  which is based on management s current expectations of this business future profitability 
management has lowered its earning expectations for msi canterbury based on the declining  but profitable performance in fiscal the carrying values of goodwill for usertech canterbury  and usc canterbury  were also reviewed as of november  and no impairment charge was deemed necessary for either subsidiary 
in fiscal the company recorded  of goodwill impairment charges 
 of this charge was reflected in the second quarter of the year and the balance was recorded in the fourth quarter 
management made the decision to treat the carrying value of goodwill conservatively 
dmi canterbury goodwill was written down to total charge of  due to the uncertainty in the technical staffing marketplace caused by the dot com bust and the softening of spending in this business segment 
the net goodwill related to the acquisition of calc canterbury training and consulting segment totaling  was also written off 
the lingering current effects of september  as well as the uncertainty of future business growth due to the change in business climate surrounding new york city are the major reasons for this impairment charge 
finally  the net goodwill of  resulting from the acquisition of atm canterbury software development segment was also written off 
recent operating results may be indicative that the book value of the goodwill may not be recoverable 
management believes that these impairment charges reflect the net carrying value of goodwill on the november  balance sheet under a conservative valuation approach due to the current operating losses and uncertain business environment of calc canterbury  dmi canterbury and atm canterbury 
all goodwill impairment expense is reflected under corporate in the segment reporting footnote for fiscal the company s earnings forecasts for purposes of these impairment tests are consistent with forecasts and budgets currently used in the management of these businesses 
the estimated fair value of the goodwill amounts are based upon future expectations  and if actual results are significantly lower  the likelihood is that these estimates would change  resulting in future impairment charges 
revenue recognition as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  the securities and exchange commission sec recently issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  which provides additional guidance in applying generally accepted accounting principles for revenue recognition 
sab states that revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the product has been delivered  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the vast majority of our revenue transactions contain standard business terms and conditions that result in a clear determination of when revenues should be recognized 
our revenue recognition policy requires an assessment as to whether collectibility is probable  which inherently requires us to evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers and their acceptance of our delivered products and services 
valuation allowance deferred tax assets the company records valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts that are more likely than not to be realized 
this process involves forecasting the future profitability of our businesses to determine whether the company is expecting to generate sufficient taxable income to fully utilize our existing tax loss carryforwards and other tax assets that become future tax deductions 
the company has recorded a valuation allowance of  and  for the years ended november  and  respectively 
the valuation allowance was increased for the year ended november  due to the softness in customer demand during the second half of  that resulted in the company falling short of budgeted revenues and earnings 
this resulted in a  expense in fiscal related to an adjustment to the beginning of the year balance of the valuation allowance 
at november   the company had loss carryforwards of  for federal income tax reporting purposes and  for state income tax reporting purposes 
future expiration dates of federal loss carryforwards are as follows      and  
state loss carryforwards expire between and the determination of the valuation allowance is based upon our earnings forecasts that we use in the management of our businesses 
therefore  we are required to make estimates and judgments based upon historical experience and the best information available to us 
however  future events are subject to change and we may have to adjust the valuation allowance in future periods  accordingly 
fiscal compared to fiscal revenues overall revenues decreased by  in fiscal over fiscal revenues in the training and consulting segment reflected a net decrease of  
this decrease however was the result of a significant reduction in revenues from existing subsidiaries of  primarily calc canterbury  offset by the addition of revenues from the newly acquired usertech subsidiary totaling  during the fourth quarter of fiscal there were a number of factors which contributed to the revenue reduction from existing subsidiaries primarily calc canterbury in this business segment 
the events of september  in new york city had a significant effect on total revenues in the fourth quarter of the year 
training in the metro new york city area came to a virtual standstill while the businesses affected by the tragedy struggled to cope with the devastation 
many classes were cancelled  and there was very little sales activity for the last three months of the year 
several of our largest customers were located at ground zero 
consulting assignments were delayed or cancelled due to the chaos in and around new york city 
the company s business interruption insurance policy provided limited relief to the economic impact of the terrorist attacks 
proceeds from the policy netted the company approximately  which was received in the first quarter of fiscal even prior to september   the economic downturn in the technology sector had softened demand for certain training and consulting products during several large clients had reduced their training budgets in the second half of the year in response to their own fiscal situations 
new software rollouts were delayed and application and technical training revenues suffered during the year as a result 
as the first quarter of fiscal progresses  the company is seeing signs that the level of activity by our customers is beginning to improve 
the new york city client base is regrouping and the amount of training and consulting opportunities are increasing 
the company is working to expand its sales presence in this market to capture the apparent pent up demand caused by the soft fourth quarter of fiscal also  the acquisition of usertech provides the company with even more expertise in distance learning 
all of the company s training subsidiaries are beginning to work together to blend existing course content with e learning delivery capabilities 
for clients in and around new york city  as well as the rest of the world  the company will have the capacity to provide a distance learning solution to those who may choose not to attend classroom training in the future 
revenues in the value added hardware reseller segment decreased by  in fiscal versus again much of this shortfall occurred during the fourth fiscal quarter of the year as overall technology spending slowed 
the reduction in sales volume was more than offset by a significant increase in gross profit from these sales 
margins increased to in fiscal from in  as the sales staff was more selective in making proposals coupled with very strong manufacturer rebate program participation 
revenues in the technical staffing segment increased by  in fiscal due to the fact that the acquisition of dmi canterbury occurred part way through fiscal  and did not contribute for a full year 
costs and expenses total costs and expenses decreased by  in fiscal versus gross profit on service revenue declined from in fiscal to in due to the effects of the revenue decline from training and consulting coupled with a fairly high fixed cost delivery component 
product margins  which include hardware and software sales of the company increased to in from a level of in fiscal consolidated gross margins for the company increased to in versus in fiscal selling expense increased by  in fiscal over  of the increase was due to selling expense incurred by usertech after the september  acquisition 
the balance of the difference can be attributed to the fact that dmi  which was acquired in august   had a full year of operations in fiscal versus only four months in general and administrative expense increased by  
again a portion of the increase can be accounted for by the addition of usertech  and the incremental cost associated with a full year of operations for dmi 
other components of the increase include increased provision for bad debt of  increased salaries of  and other miscellaneous non cash corporate write offs approximating  which were recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 
also during fiscal the company recorded  of goodwill impairment charges 
 of this charge was reflected in the second quarter of the year and the balance was recorded in the fourth quarter 
dmi canterbury goodwill was written down to total charge of  due to the uncertainty in the technical staffing marketplace caused by the dot com bust and the softening of spending in this business segment 
the net goodwill related to the acquisition of calc canterbury training and consulting segment totaling  was also written off 
the lingering current effects of september  as well as the uncertainty of future business growth due to the change in business climate surrounding new york city are the major reasons for this impairment charge 
finally  the net goodwill of  resulting from the acquisition of atm canterbury software development segment was also written off 
recent operating results may be indicative that the book value of the goodwill may not be recoverable 
management believes that these impairment charges reflect the net carrying value of goodwill on the november  balance sheet under a conservative valuation approach due to the current operating losses and uncertain business environment of calc canterbury  dmi canterbury and atm canterbury 
all goodwill impairment expense is reflected under corporate in the segment reporting footnote 
interest expense was reduced by  in fiscal as compared to fiscal strong operating cash flow allowed for reductions in borrowings related to the usertech acquisition and lower floating interest rates provided expense relief during the year 
other expense of  was comprised of two components 
first a charge of  was recorded during the fourth quarter related to the impairment of an investment available for sale 
the approximately  shares of the publicly traded company were accepted by the company from until early as payment for services delivered to this start up organization 
current market value coupled with the organization s poor balance sheet gave rise to the need for this charge in the fourth quarter of during the first quarter of the company also recorded an investment impairment charge of  for another security held for sale 
also reflected in other expenses for fiscal is a loss of  related to the sale of real estate during the second quarter of the year 
fiscal results of operations included many non cash  non recurring charges to the income statement 
he following list will summarize thesecharges goodwill impairment  investment impairment  loss on sale of land  reserve for uncollectible accounts  debt issuance cost write off  total  if these non cash  non recurring charges were eliminated from the fiscal statement of operation  the company would have shown a pretax profit of approximately  before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle
