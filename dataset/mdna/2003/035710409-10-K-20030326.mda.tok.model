overview we are a real estate investment trust that owns and manages a portfolio of mortgage backed securities 
our principal business objective is to generate net income for distribution to our stockholders from the spread between the interest income on our mortgage backed securities and the costs of borrowing to finance our acquisition of mortgage backed securities 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on the amounts reported in our financial statements 
these financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in preparing the financial statements  management is required to make various judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on our financial statements 
the following is a summary of our policies that is the most affected by management s judgments  estimates and assumptions 
market valuation of securities all assets classified as available for sale are reported at fair value  based on market prices 
our policy is to obtain market values from three independent sources and record the market value of the securities based on the average of the three 
amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts premiums and discounts associated with the purchase of the mortgage backed securities are amortized into interest income over the lives of the securities using the interest method 
our policy for estimating prepayment speeds for calculating the effective yield is to evaluate historical performance  street consensus prepayment speeds  and current market conditions 
results of operations net income summary for the year ended december   our net income was million or basic earnings per average share  as compared to million or basic earnings per average share for the year ended december  for the year ended december   our net income was million  or basic earnings per average share 
net income per average share increased by and total net income increased by million 
the increase in net income over is attributable to our acquisition of additional mortgage backed securities using proceeds raised from our january public offering and equity shelf program during the year and the increase in the interest rate spread between our interest earning assets and our interest bearing liabilities 
the same is true for the increase in net income for the year  when compared to the year we consummated three public offerings in the year and the interest rate spread increased 
we compute our net income per share by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of outstanding common stock during the period  which was  for the year ended december    for the year ended december   and  for the year ended december  dividends per share for the year ended december  were  or an aggregate of million 
dividends per share for the year ended december  were per share  or million in total 
dividends per share for the year ended december  were per share  or million in total 
our return on average equity was for the year ended december   for the year ended december   and for the year ended december  the increase in return on equity in compared to is primarily due to the favorable interest rate environment 
the table below presents the net income summary for the years ended december      and net income summary dollars in the thousands  except for per share data year ended year ended year ended year ended year ended december  december  december december  december  interest income      interest expense      net interest income      gain on sale of mortgage backed securities     general and administrative expenses      net income      average number of basic shares outstanding      average number of diluted shares outstanding      basic net income per share diluted net income per share average total assets      average equity      annualized return on average assets annualized return on average equity interest income and average earning asset yield we had average earning assets of billion for the year ended december  we had average earning assets of billion for the year ended december  we had average earning assets of billion for the year ended december  our primary source of income for the years ended december    and was interest income 
a portion of our income was generated by gains on the sales of our mortgage backed securities 
our interest income was million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  our yield on average earning assets was   and for the same respective periods 
our yield on average earning assets decreased by and our average earning asset balance increased by billion for the year ended december   when compared to the prior year 
due to the increase in the asset base resulting from the inflow of capital from our public offering and equity shelf program during the year ended december   interest income increased by million 
our yield on average earning assets decreased by and our average earning asset balance increased by billion for the year ended december   when compared to the prior year 
due to the increase in assets resulting from the three public offerings during the year ended december   interest income increased by million 
the table below shows our average balance of cash equivalents and mortgage backed securities  the yields we earned on each type of earning assets  our yield on average earning assets and our interest income for the years ended december     and  and the four quarters in average earning asset yield ratios for the four quarters in are annualized yield on average yield on average yield on average mortgage average average mortgage average cash backed earning cash backed earning interest equivalents securities assets equivalents securities assets income dollars in thousands for the year ended december     for the year ended december     average yield on average yield on average mortgage average average mortgage average cash backed earning cash backed earning interest equivalents securities assets equivalents securities assets income dollars in thousands for the year ended december     for the year ended december     for the year ended december     for the quarter ended december     for the quarter ended september     for the quarter ended june     for the quarter ended march     the constant prepayment rate cpr on our mortgage backed securities for the year ended december  was  for the year ended december  was  and for the year ended december  was 
cpr is an assumed rate of prepayment for our mortgage backed securities  expressed as an annual rate of prepayment relative to the outstanding principal balance of our mortgage backed securities 
cpr does not purport to be either a historical description of the prepayment experience of our mortgage backed securities or a prediction of the anticipated rate of prepayment of our mortgage backed securities 
principal prepayments had a negative effect on our earning asset yield for the years ended december    and because we adjust our rates of premium amortization and discount accretion monthly based upon the effective yield method  which takes into consideration changes in prepayment speeds 
interest expense and the cost of funds our largest expense is the cost of borrowed funds  primarily through repurchase agreements 
we had average borrowed funds of billion for the year ended december   billion for the year ended december   and billion for the year ended december  interest expense totaled million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
our average cost of funds was for the year ended december   for the year ended december   and for the year ended december  the cost of funds rate decreased by and the average borrowed funds increased by billion for the year ended december  interest expense for the year ended december  increased million  from million to million 
we increased our asset base by raising approximately million of additional capital in as a result  we increased the amounts borrowed under repurchase agreements 
consequently  the increased interest expense for the year is the result of our growth 
the cost of funds rate decreased by and the average borrowed funds increased by billion for the year ended december  interest expense for the year ended december  increased million 
we increased our asset base by raising approximately million of additional capital in consequently  the increased interest expense for the year is the result of our growth 
changes in our short term cost of funds are expected to be closely correlated with changes in short term libor  although we have chosen to extend the maturity on a portion of our liabilities to three years 
our average cost of funds was greater than average one month libor for the year ended december   and greater than average six month libor 
our average cost of funds was less than average one month libor for the year ended december   and greater than average six month libor 
our average cost of funds was equal to average one month libor for the year ended december   and less than average six month libor

the net interest spread for the year ended december  was  as compared to for the year ended december  our net interest income increased by million for the year ended december  over the prior year 
the increase in our balance sheet which resulted from our raising additional capital in  along with the increase in the interest rate spread 
the substantial increase in our balance sheet in which resulted from our raising additional capital in that year  along with the increase in the interest rate spread  caused the million increase in net interest income 
net interest margin  which equals net interest income divided by average interest earning assets  was for the year ended december   for the year ended december   and for the year ended december  the principal reason that net interest margin exceeded net interest spread is that average interest earning assets exceeded average interest bearing liabilities 
a portion of our assets is funded with equity rather than borrowings

for the year ended december   we sold mortgage backed securities with an aggregate historical amortized cost of billion for an aggregate gain of million 
for the year ended december   we sold mortgage backed securities with an aggregate historical amortized cost of million for an aggregate gain of million 
the gain on sale of assets for the year ended december  increased by million over the prior year 
we were able to take advantage to the appreciation in our portfolio  while maintaining a book value of 
the gain on sale of assets for the year ended december  increased by million over the prior year 
even though the gain for the year increased over the prior year  as a percentage of total income it declined 
we do not expect to sell assets on a frequent basis  but may from time to time sell existing assets to move into new assets  which our management believes might have higher risk adjusted returns  or to manage our balance sheet as part of our asset liability management strategy 
credit losses we have not experienced credit losses on our mortgage backed securities to date 
we have limited our exposure to credit losses on our mortgage backed securities by purchasing only securities  issued or guaranteed by federal home loan mortgage corporation  the federal national mortgage association  or the government national mortgage association  which  although not rated  carry an implied aaa rating 
under our capital investment policy  however  up to of our securities could be rated bbb or better or if unrated  securities we deem to be of a quality bbb or better

the increase in net income for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   is a direct result of growth in our balance sheet following our three public offerings in  as well as the favorable interest rate environment during the year we were able to take advantage of appreciation in asset value in the gain on sale of securities increased by million for the year ended december   as compared to the prior year 
the table below shows our net interest income  gain on sale of mortgage backed securities and g a expenses each as a percentage of average equity  and the return on average equity for the years ended december      and  and for the four quarters in components of return on average equity ratios for the four quarters in have been annualized gain on sale of net interest mortgage backed g a return on income average securities average expenses average average equity equity equity equity for the year ended december  for the year ended december  for the year ended december  for the year ended december  for the year ended december  for the quarter ended december  for the quarter ended september  for the quarter ended june  for the quarter ended march  financial condition mortgage backed securities all of our mortgage backed securities at december    and were adjustable rate or fixed rate mortgage backed securities backed by single family mortgage loans 
all of the mortgage assets underlying these mortgage backed securities were secured with a first lien position on the underlying single family properties 
all our mortgage backed securities were fhlmc  fnma or gnma mortgage pass through certificates or cmos  which carry an implied aaa rating 
we mark to market all of our earning assets at liquidation value 
we accrete discount balances as an increase in interest income over the life of discount mortgage backed securities and we amortize premium balances as a decrease in interest income over the life of premium mortgage backed securities 
at december    and  we had on our balance sheet a total of  million  and  respectively  of unamortized discount which is the difference between the remaining principal value and current historical amortized cost of our mortgage backed securities acquired at a price below principal value and a total of million  million  and million  respectively  of unamortized premium which is the difference between the remaining principal value and the current historical amortized cost of our mortgage backed securities acquired at a price above principal value 
we received mortgage principal repayments of billion for the year ended december   billion for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  the overall prepayment speed for the year ended december    was   and  respectively 
during the quarter ended december   the prepayment speeds were the highest in our history at 
the result was record returns of principal for the year  relative to the asset size 
the increase in prepayments in from was primarily because we acquired more mortgage backed securities following our three public offerings 
given our current portfolio composition  if mortgage principal prepayment rates were to increase over the life of our mortgage backed securities  all other factors being equal  our net interest income would decrease during the life of these mortgage backed securities as we would be required to amortize our net premium balance into income over a shorter time period 
similarly  if mortgage principal prepayment rates were to decrease over the life of our mortgage backed securities  all other factors being equal  our net interest income would increase during the life of these mortgage backed securities as we would amortize our net premium balance over a longer time period

weighted average annual period cap none weighted average lifetime cap at december  mortgage principal value as percentage of mortgage backed securities at december  borrowings to date  our debt has consisted entirely of borrowings collateralized by a pledge of our mortgage backed securities 
these borrowings appear on our balance sheet as repurchase agreements 
at december   we had established uncommitted borrowing facilities in this market with lenders in amounts  which we believe  are in excess of our needs 
we believe that we have used approximately of our uncommitted borrowing line 
all of our mortgage backed securities are currently accepted as collateral for these borrowings 
however  we limit our borrowings  and thus our potential asset growth  in order to maintain unused borrowing capacity and thus increase the liquidity and strength of our balance sheet 
at december   we had collateral in excess of the required haircut on our repurchase agreements in the amount of million 
for the year ended december   the term to maturity of our borrowings ranged from one day to three years  with a weighted average original term to maturity of days at december  for the years ended december  and  the term to maturity of our borrowings ranged from one day to three years  with a weighted average original term to maturity of days at december   and days at december  at december   the weighted average cost of funds for all of our borrowings was and the weighted average term to next rate adjustment was days 
at december   the weighted average cost of funds for all of our borrowings was and the weighted average term to next rate adjustment was days 
at december   the weighted average cost of funds for all of our borrowings was and the weighted average term to next rate adjustment was days 
at december   the weighted average original term increased because of the use of three year repurchase agreements 
liquidity liquidity  which is our ability to turn non cash assets into cash  allows us to purchase additional mortgage backed securities and to pledge additional assets to secure existing borrowings should the value of our pledged assets decline 
potential immediate sources of liquidity for us include cash balances and unused borrowing capacity 
unused borrowing capacity will vary over time as the market value of our mortgage backed securities varies 
our balance sheet also generates liquidity on an on going basis through mortgage principal repayments and net earnings held prior to payment as dividends 
should our needs ever exceed these on going sources of liquidity plus the immediate sources of liquidity discussed above  we believe that our mortgage backed securities could in most circumstances be sold to raise cash 
the maintenance of liquidity is one of the goals of our capital investment policy 
under this policy  we limit asset growth in order to preserve unused borrowing capacity for liquidity management purposes 
stockholders equity we use available for sale treatment for our mortgage backed securities  we carry these assets on our balance sheet at estimated market value rather than historical amortized cost 
based upon this available for sale treatment  our equity base at december  was billion  or per share 
if we had used historical amortized cost accounting  our equity base at december  would have been billion  or per share 
our equity base at december  was million  or per share 
if we had used historical amortized cost accounting  our equity base at december  would have been million  or per share 
our equity base at december  was million  or per share 
if we had used historical amortized cost accounting  our equity base at december  would have been million  or per share 
through the equity shelf program  in which we sell shares from time to time at market prices  we raised approximately million in net proceeds and issued  shares during also in   shares were purchased through our dividend reinvestment and share purchase plan  totaling approximately million 
we also completed an offering of common stock in the first quarter issuing  shares  with aggregate net proceeds of approximately million 
we completed three public offerings during the year ended december  in which we issued a total of  shares of common stock  and received aggregate net proceeds of approximately million 
with our available for sale accounting treatment  unrealized fluctuations in market values of assets do not impact our gaap or taxable income but rather are reflected on our balance sheet by changing the carrying value of the asset and stockholders equity under accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
by accounting for our assets in this manner  we hope to provide useful information to stockholders and creditors and to preserve flexibility to sell assets in the future without having to change accounting methods 
as a result of this mark to market accounting treatment  our book value and book value per share are likely to fluctuate far more than if we used historical amortized cost accounting 
as a result  comparisons with companies that use historical cost accounting for some or all of their balance sheet may not be meaningful 
the table below shows unrealized gains and losses on the mortgage backed securities in our portfolio 
unrealized gains and losses dollars in thousands at december  unrealized gain      unrealized loss      net unrealized gain loss      net unrealized gain loss as of mortgage backed securities principal value net unrealized gain loss as of mortgage backed securities amortized cost unrealized changes in the estimated net market value of mortgage backed securities have one direct effect on our potential earnings and dividends positive marked to market changes increase our equity base and allow us to increase our borrowing capacity while negative changes tend to limit borrowing capacity under our capital investment policy 
a very large negative change in the net market value of our mortgage backed securities might impair our liquidity position  requiring us to sell assets with the likely result of realized losses upon sale 
the net unrealized gains loss on available for sale securities was million  or or the amortized cost of our mortgage backed securities as of december   million  or or the amortized cost of our mortgage backed securities as of december   and million  or of the amortized cost of our mortgage backed securities at december  the table below shows our equity capital base as reported and on a historical amortized cost basis at december      and  and september   june  and march  issuances of common stock  the level of earnings as compared to dividends declared  and other factors influence our historical cost equity capital base

we generally expect to maintain a ratio of debt to equity of between and  although the ratio may vary from this range from time to time based upon various factors  including our management s opinion of the level of risk of our assets and liabilities  our liquidity position  our level of unused borrowing capacity and over collateralization levels required by lenders when we pledge assets to secure borrowings 
our target debt to equity ratio is determined under our capital investment policy 
should our actual debt to equity ratio increase above the target level due to asset acquisition or market value fluctuations in assets  we will cease to acquire new assets 
our management will  at that time  present a plan to our board of directors to bring us back to our target debt to equity ratio  in many circumstances  this would be accomplished over time by the monthly reduction of the balance of our mortgage backed securities through principal repayments 
asset liability management and effect of changes in interest rates we continually review our asset liability management strategy with respect to interest rate risk  mortgage prepayment risk  credit risk and the related issues of capital adequacy and liquidity 
our goal is to provide attractive risk adjusted stockholder returns while maintaining what we believe is a strong balance sheet 
we seek to manage the extent to which our net income changes as a function of changes in interest rates by matching adjustable rate assets with variable rate borrowings 
in addition  although we have not done so to date  we may seek to mitigate the potential impact on net income of periodic and lifetime coupon adjustment restrictions in our portfolio of mortgage backed securities by entering into interest rate agreements such as interest rate caps and interest rate swaps 
changes in interest rates may also affect the rate of mortgage principal prepayments and  as a result  prepayments on mortgage backed securities 
we will seek to mitigate the effect of changes in the mortgage principal repayment rate by balancing assets we purchase at a premium with assets we purchase at a discount 
to date  the aggregate premium exceeds the aggregate discount on our mortgage backed securities 
as a result  prepayments  which result in the expensing of unamortized premium  will reduce our net income compared to what net income would be absent such prepayments 
inflation virtually all of our assets and liabilities are financial in nature 
as a result  interest rates and other factors drive our performance far more than does inflation 
changes in interest rates do not necessarily correlate with inflation rates or changes in inflation rates 
our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap and our dividends based upon our net income as calculated for tax purposes  in each case  our activities and balance sheet are measured with reference to historical cost or fair market value without considering inflation 
other matters we calculate that our qualified real estate investment trust reit assets  as defined in the internal revenue code  are of our total assets at december    and as compared to the internal revenue code requirement that at least of our total assets be qualified reit assets 
we also calculate that of our revenue qualifies for the source of income test  and of its revenue qualifies for the source of income test  under the reit rules for the years ended december    and we also met all reit requirements regarding the ownership of our common stock and the distribution of our net income 
therefore  as of december    and we believe that we qualified as a reit under the internal revenue code 
we at all times intend to conduct our business so as not to become regulated as an investment company under the investment company act of  as amended the investment company act 
if we were to become regulated as an investment company  then our use of leverage would be substantially reduced 
the investment company act exempts entities that are primarily engaged in the business of purchasing or otherwise acquiring mortgages and other liens on and interests in real estate qualifying interests 
under current interpretation of the staff of the sec  in order to qualify for this exemption  we must maintain at least of our assets directly in qualifying interests 
in addition  unless certain mortgage securitites represent all the certificates issued with respect to an underlying pool of mortgages  the mortgage backed securities may be treated as securities separate from the underlying mortgage loans and  thus  may not be considered qualifying interests for purposes of the requirement 
we calculate that as of december    and we were in compliance with this requirement 
item a quantitative and qualitiative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control 
changes in the general level of interest rates can affect our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred in connection with our interest bearing liabilities  by affecting the spread between our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
changes in the level of interest rates also can affect the value of our mortgage backed securities and our ability to realize gains from the sale of these assets 
we may utilize a variety of financial instruments  including interest rate swaps  caps  floors and other interest rate exchange contracts  in order to limit the effects of interest rates on our operations 
if we use these types of derivatives to hedge the risk of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities  we may be subject to certain risks  including the risk that losses on a hedge position will reduce the funds available for payments to holders of securities and that the losses may exceed the amount we invested in the instruments 
to date  we have not purchased any hedging instruments 
our profitability and the value of our portfolio may be adversely affected during any period as a result of changing interest rates 
the following table quantifies the potential changes in net interest income and portfolio value should interest rates go up or down basis points  assuming the yield curves of the rate shocks will be parallel to each other and the current yield curve 
all changes in income and value are measured as percentage changes from the projected net interest income and portfolio value at the base interest rate scenario 
the base interest rate scenario assumes interest rates at december   and various estimates regarding prepayment and all activities are made at each level of rate shock 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates 
projected percentage change in projected percentage change in change in interest rate net interest income portfolio value basis points basis points basis points base interest rate basis points basis points basis points asset and liability management asset and liability management is concerned with the timing and magnitude of the repricing of assets and liabilities 
we attempt to control risks associated with interest rate movements 
methods for evaluating interest rate risk include an analysis of our interest rate sensitivity gap  which is the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to affect net interest income adversely 
because different types of assets and liabilities with the same or similar maturities may react differently to changes in overall market rates or conditions  changes in interest rates may affect net interest income positively or negatively even if an institution were perfectly matched in each maturity category 
the following table sets forth the estimated maturity or repricing of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  the amounts of assets and liabilities shown within a particular period were determined in accordance with the contractual terms of the assets and liabilities  except adjustable rate loans  and securities are included in the period in which their interest rates are first scheduled to adjust and not in the period in which they mature 
mortgage backed securities reflect estimated prepayments that were estimated based on analyses of broker estimates  the results of a prepayment model that we utilized and empirical data 
our management believes that these assumptions approximate actual experience and considers them reasonable  however  the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities in the table could vary substantially if different assumptions were used or actual experience differs from the historical experience on which the assumptions are based

these analyses rely on models which utilize estimates of fair value and interest rate sensitivity 
actual economic conditions or implementation of investment decisions by our management may produce results that differ significantly form the estimates and assumptions used in our models and the projected results shown in the above tables and in this report 
these analyses contain certain forward looking statements and are subject to the safe harbor statement set forth under the heading  special note regarding forward looking statements
