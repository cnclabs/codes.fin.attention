forward looking statements this report contains forward looking statements regarding our plans  expectations  estimates and beliefs 
actual results could differ materially from those discussed in  or implied by  these forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are identified by words such as believe  anticipate  expect  intend  plan  will  may and other similar expressions 
in addition  any statements that refer to expectations  projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward looking statements 
forward looking statements in this report include  but are not necessarily limited to  those relating to our beliefs regarding the competitive technological advantages and anticipated commercial success of our technologies  intention to achieve widespread commercial acceptance of our licensed technologies  ability to obtain new licensees  ability to develop new or existing switch technologies  objective to establish duraswitch technologies as the design standard in the electronic switch and icp industries  estimates of anticipated growth in the switch and icp markets  success in developing new or enhanced products to take advantage of market opportunities or to respond to competition  ability to gain the manufacturing industry s acceptance and demand for our technology licenses  licensees willingness and ability to successfully market our technologies to new and existing customers  and opportunities derived from our investments 
when you consider the forward looking statements in this report  you should keep in mind the cautionary information located elsewhere in this report 
our performance may differ materially from that contemplated by such forward looking statements as a result of certain risk factors  including but not limited to those set forth below 
our technologies may not gain market acceptance 
our success will depend in part on the commercial acceptance of our patented technologies 
to be accepted  our technologies must meet the expectations of our potential customers 
we market our technologies directly to oems  whose products utilize switches  and to our licensees to encourage them to incorporate our technologies in the switches they supply to oems  focusing on the advantages of our switches over the electro mechanical and dome membrane switches 
if the oems or our licensees ultimately decide to continue with their existing switch technologies  our business would be adversely affected 
should we be unable to protect our proprietary technologies  their value and our competitive position would be significantly impaired 
although we seek to protect our intellectual property rights through patents  copyrights  trade secret protection and other measures  we may be unable to adequately protect our technologies  competitors may be able to develop similar or better technologies independently  any of our pending patent applications may not be issued  or intellectual property laws may not continue to protect our intellectual property rights  particularly as we expand our licensing in foreign countries where the local laws do not provide a strong protection of intellectual properties or recognize international treaties 
claims that we infringe third party intellectual property rights could result in significant expenses or restrictions on our ability to license technology 
in recent years  there has been significant litigation in the united states involving patents and other intellectual property rights 
from time to time  third parties may assert patent  copyright  trademark and other intellectual property claims against technologies used in our business 
any such claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend  would result in costly litigation and divert the efforts of our personnel 
claims of intellectual property infringement might require us to enter into costly royalty or license agreements 
additionally  we might be unable to obtain royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to us 
a successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us could have a material adverse affect on our business 
we are not currently involved in any litigation to protect our technologies from infringement or to defend against claims of infringement 
our quarterly revenue and operating results may fluctuate 
our results may fluctuate from those in prior quarters and will continue to do so due to a variety of factors 
these factors include the establishment  growth or loss of licensee relationships  the timing of introductions  production and sales cycles of new products by our licensees incorporating our technologies  which is at the discretion of our licensees and their customers  and market acceptance of our technologies 
our stock price may be volatile 
the stock market has experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated or disproportionate to the performance of particular companies 
these market fluctuations may cause our stock price to decrease regardless of our performance 
the market price of our common stock has been  and in the future could be  significantly affected by factors such as  but not limited to actual or anticipated fluctuations in operating results  announcements of our technologies or our competitors technologies  new licensees or other business developments  sales or the perception in the market of possible sales by insiders or others which could have a disproportionate effect on our stock price due to our typically low trading volume 
the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of the stocks of technology companies 
recently  the market price of our common stock  like that of many technology companies  has experienced significant fluctuations 
for instance  from august   the date we became a reporting company  to march   the price of our common stock ranged from to per share 
on march   the last reported sale price of our common stock was 
the market price of our common stock has been  and is likely to continue to be  significantly affected by expectations of analysts and investors 
reports and statements of analysts do not necessarily reflect our views 
we depend on our management team 
our future success will be largely dependent on the efforts of key management personnel 
the loss of one or more of these key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we depend upon the services of robert j 
brilon  our chief executive officer  president and chief financial officer and anthony j 
van zeeland  our chief operating officer and executive vice president engineering 
mr 
brilon has extensive experience in the formation  financing and management of entrepreneurial companies 
mr 
van zeeland has over years experience in the switch industry 
we have employment agreements with both of these individuals for terms that expire in april we depend on our relationship with delphi 
we enter into license agreements and other similar contractual relationships under which we license our technologies 
any termination or breach of our relationship with delphi  cessation of operations by delphi  or non performance under the license agreement by delphi  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our license agreement with delphi requires delphi to pay us minimum royalty payments  beginning july   totaling million during the initial seven year term ending june  delphi can maintain exclusivity for the automotive industry through june  by making additional minimum royalty payments during that period 
after june   either party may convert the agreement to a non exclusive agreement through we may have difficulty protecting our intellectual property rights overseas 
the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the united states  and many us companies have encountered substantial infringement problems in some foreign countries 
because some of our products are sold and a portion of our business is conducted overseas  our exposure to intellectual property risks may be higher 
rights to acquire shares of common stock could result in dilution to other holders of common stock 
as of december   we had issued options to purchase  shares of common stock under our stock option plans at a weighted average exercise price of per share 
we have filed registration statements under the securities laws to register the common stock to be issued under our stock option plans 
as a result  shares issued under these plans will be freely tradable without restriction unless acquired by affiliates of our company  who will be subject to the volume and other limitations of rule in addition  there were outstanding warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at a weighted average exercise price of per share 
the existence of such stock options could adversely affect the terms on which we can obtain additional financing  and the option holders can be expected to purchase shares at a time when we  in all likelihood  would be able to obtain additional capital by offering shares of common stock on terms more favorable to us than those provided by such options 
we have a history of operating losses and expect to incur losses in the immediate future 
we have had substantial losses since our inception and we expect to incur additional losses as we expand our licensing business 
we expect to commit substantial resources to the establishment of new licensee relationships and sales and training capabilities 
because we have only recently completed our shift to a technology licensing business model  we are unable to accurately estimate future revenue and operating expenses based upon historical performance and we cannot assure you if and when we will become profitable 
risks related to rapidly changing technology 
our results of operations will depend in part on successful management of the challenges of rapidly changing technology and evolving industry standards characteristic of the market for switch technology 
these challenges include predicting the nature and timing of technological changes and the direction of evolving industry standards and identifying  developing and successfully marketing new technologies as they emerge 
we work with our licensees and oems to design solutions specific to their needs and the needs of their customers 
our growing international business activities subject us to risks that could reduce the demand for our products and increase our operating expense 
in  net revenue from international licensees represented of our total net revenue 
we have been expanding our licensing business with international licensees and expect that net revenue from international licensees will increase 
to date  all of our licensing revenue and substantially all of our costs have been denominated in us dollars 
we expect that net revenue and substantially all of our costs will continue to be denominated in us dollars for the foreseeable future 
we could be significantly affected by other risks associated with international activities  including the following different technology standards and design requirements  longer payment cycles for and greater difficulties collecting accounts receivable  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  nationalization  expropriation and limitations on repatriation of cash  social  economic  banking and political risks  taxation  changes in us laws and policies affecting trade  foreign investment and loans  and changes in enforcement of laws protecting intellectual property 
general the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and associated notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
we have developed  patented and licensed innovative technologies utilizing a magnetic based design for electronic switches 
we are currently expanding the use of these technologies by licensing manufacturers to produce and sell products using our technologies 
we believe these patented and patent pending technologies allow us and our licensees to provide innovative solutions to the design challenges faced by oems and component suppliers 
our research and development expenses are comprised mainly of research and development personnel and occupancy costs 
our selling  general and administrative expenses are comprised mainly of labor costs associated with our sales and administrative salaries  depreciation and amortization  travel costs  advertising and occupancy costs 
during the second quarter of  we completed the transition to a licensing business model away from switch manufacturing and  as a result  the relationship between net revenue  cost of goods sold and operating expenses reflected in our financial information may not represent future expected financial relationships 
given the early stage of our licensing business model  we do not believe period to period comparisons of results of operations are meaningful 
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations when such policies affect our reported or expected financial results 
in the ordinary course of business  we have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our most difficult  subjective  and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition 
we enter into licensing agreements with our customers 
our licensing strategy incorporates a simplified requirement whereby the licensee purchases licensed components from us 
the purchase price of the licensed components includes the royalty fee 
when the components are shipped  we recognize licensing revenue and licensing cost of goods sold 
in some cases where no licensed components are supplied  we are paid a royalty per switch manufactured by the licensee 
some of our licensees have prepaid royalties to us pursuant to their license agreements 
these prepayments are recorded as deferred revenue 
this deferred revenue is recognized as licensing revenue when earned under the licensing agreement 
if a licensee purchases a licensed component from us  the royalty is earned when the licensed component is shipped 
if the licensee is directly manufacturing our switches without purchasing licensed components from us  we consider the royalty earned when the switch is manufactured 
in the case of our exclusive license agreement with delphi  the up front payment is nonrefundable and the portion of the million payment allocated to deferred revenue is being amortized over the initial seven year term of the agreement 
see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
inventory valuation 
our inventory is primarily comprised of licensed components which are sold to licensees and raw materials which are primarily used for research and development projects and manufacturing marketing samples 
we state inventories at the lower of cost or market value  determined using the first in  first out method 
our policy is to write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory to the extent the cost exceeds the estimated market value 
we base the estimate on our assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those assumed in our estimates  additional inventory write downs might be required 
we reflect any write down of inventory in the period in which the facts giving rise to the inventory write down become known to us 
impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we review our long lived assets and identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
additionally  goodwill is reviewed on an annual basis 
our intangible assets are primarily our patents and the goodwill associated with the acquisition of aztec industries 
if such assets were considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized would be measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair market value of the assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of property and equipment and intangibles excluding goodwill not held for sale by comparing the carrying amount of the asset or group of assets against the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or group of assets 
if the undiscounted estimated cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset or group of assets being reviewed  an impairment loss would be recorded 
the loss would be measured based on the estimated fair value of the asset or group of assets compared to its carrying value 
the estimated fair value would be based on the best information available under the circumstances  including prices for similar assets and the results of valuation techniques  including the present value of expected future cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of our company  which is the only reporting unit  with the carrying value  including goodwill 
the estimated fair value is based on the best information available under the circumstances  including quoted market prices in stock markets  valuation techniques based on earnings  or independent valuations 
if the fair value of our company exceeds the carrying amount  goodwill is not considered to be impaired 
if the carrying amount of our company exceeds our fair value  the fair value of the goodwill is calculated  and the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over its fair value is recorded as an impairment loss 
to determine the fair value of goodwill  our fair value is allocated to all of our assets and liabilities  and any excess of fair value of our company over the fair value of our assets and liabilities is the estimated fair value of goodwill 
results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net revenue 
during  we started to implement our new business model of licensing our technologies rather than manufacturing switches ourselves 
we completed this transition in june and expect substantially all of our future revenues to come from our licensing efforts 
as of december   we had licensees  foreign and domestic 
because the revenue generated from licensing switch technologies is lower than the revenue from manufacturing the same number of switches  we expected our net revenue to decrease during our transition to licensing 
concurrently  our gross profits as a percentage of revenue increased because the cost of goods sold associated with licensing is much lower than with manufacturing 
we recorded net revenue of  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  the decrease is due primarily to the expected decrease in product revenue as a result of the completion of our transition from manufacturing to licensing switch technologies and decreased licensing revenue resulting from a decrease in per switch royalties and a decrease in the per design review revenue 
licensing revenue was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  a decrease of  or 
our licensing revenue is primarily comprised of the recognition of revenue resulting from the recognition of deferred revenue from our license agreement with delphi and per switch revenue from non exclusive licensees who manufacture switches incorporating our technologies 
the per switch revenue includes royalties and revenue from the sale of licensed components 
to date  the majority of non exclusive licensing revenue has been related to our pushgate pushbutton technology 
the number of unit sales of royalty bearing pushgates has increased during the last three years from approximately one million in  million in  to million in revenue has not tracked this increase because the average revenue earned per pushgate during was just over  the low end of the range  compared to average per pushgate revenue of in the increase in the quantity of licensed components sold was primarily related to a large sale to one licensee 
the decrease in the per switch royalties resulted from volume discounts 
licensing revenue was also impacted by a decrease in fees related to the review of customer designs 
the primary reason for the decrease in design review fees was a reduction of the amount billed per design review 
at the same time  we experienced an increase in the number of design reviews 
as contemplated in our license agreements  we have lowered these fees as our licensees have gained experience and become more proficient with our technologies as well as to remove barriers to commercial acceptance 
we anticipate that licensing revenue will fluctuate from period to period 
it will be difficult for us to predict the timing and magnitude of such revenue  as it depends on the licensees ability to market  produce and ship products that incorporate our technologies 
we believe that the amount of licensing revenue for any period is not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
our license agreement with delphi generated licensing revenue of  or of our licensing revenue and of our total net revenue for the year ended december  and  or of our licensing revenue and of our total net revenue for the year ended december  licensing revenue from delphi primarily resulted from the recognition of deferred licensing revenue  which was received in product revenue was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  a decrease of  the decrease reflects our transition to a technology licensing company 
the  of product revenue for the year ended december  was related to fees for engineering services we had provided to a customer in prior periods that were in dispute 
we do not expect to have any significant product revenue in the future 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold was  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  the decrease in cost of goods sold and the increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenue to in from in reflects our transition from the low margin business of manufacturing switch panels to the high margin business of licensing 
we anticipate that our gross profit as a percentage of revenue will fluctuate in future periods as we experience changes in the percentage of revenue generated from sales of licensed components  royalties from licensees who manufacture products utilizing our technologies without purchasing licensed components from us and the recognition of deferred revenue from our licensing agreement with delphi 
licensing cost of sales for was  compared to  in  an increase of  the increase in licensing cost of goods sold for the year ended december  was primarily due to a  charge to licensing cost of goods sold related to earlier versions of licensed components that will no longer be promoted and will only be considered as an alternative to our current licensed component inventories in limited circumstances 
this increase was offset by a reduction in our per unit cost of licensed components and decreased sales of other materials with low gross margins 
product cost of goods sold was in compared to  in  a decrease of  the decrease in product cost of goods sold was due to the completion of our transition to a licensing business model from a product based model 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  for  compared to  for  a decrease of  selling  general and administrative expenses in included a charge of  related to costs associated with the resignation of our former chief executive officer 
no such charge was recorded in the remainder of the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily related to reductions in executive and support personnel 
research and development 
research and development expenses were  for  compared to  for  a decrease of  the decrease was primarily attributable to costs related to decreased research and development personnel 
during  research and development expenses increased every quarter as we ramped up our research and development activities to expand our technology portfolio and develop various adaptations of our core technologies 
we added personnel and increased our modeling and testing capabilities  resulting in increased costs 
as we entered  we began to reduce these expenses primarily by reducing research and development personnel 
in  research and development expenses decreased each quarter from the preceding quarter 
in october  we announced cost cutting initiatives that included significant reductions in research and development personnel focused on new technologies 
the personnel reductions were completed by the end of we have created a portfolio of patented and patent pending technologies  which are available through our licensees 
the efforts of our remaining research and development personnel will continue to be directed at gaining commercial acceptance of these technologies as opposed to also focusing on the creation of new technologies 
they will continue to support our licensees in their efforts to commercialize our existing patented and patent pending technologies 
loss from operations 
as a result of the decreases in selling  general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses  loss from operations decreased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december   a decreased loss of  other income net 
other income net was  for  compared to  for  a decrease of  the decrease in other income net is due to the decrease in investment income as a result of lower interest rates and lower average cash balances 
net loss 
the decrease of  or in the net loss to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  was primarily a result of decreased selling  general and administrative expenses and decreased research and development expenses  which were offset by the reduction in investment income 
results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net revenue 
we recorded net revenue of  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december   a decrease of  the decrease in our net revenue was primarily due to our shift in our business model from switch manufacturing to technology licensing 
accordingly  our licensing revenue for increased to  compared to  in  an increase of  and our product sales revenue decreased to  for compared to  for  a decrease of  during  we started to implement our new business model of licensing our technologies rather than manufacturing switches ourselves 
we completed this transition and expect almost all of our future revenue to come from our licensing efforts 
as of december   we had licensees  foreign and domestic 
because the revenue generated from licensing switch technologies is lower than the revenue from manufacturing the same number of switches  we expected our net revenue to decrease as we transitioned to a licensing business model 
during the transition  we referred our switch customers and product sales leads to our licensees 
as expected  product revenues decreased as we completed delivery against our remaining customer purchase orders 
the shift in our business model from manufacturing to licensing and the addition of licensed manufacturers during the year accounted for the increase in our licensing revenue 
our license agreement with delphi generated licensing revenue of  or of our licensing revenue and of our total net revenue for the year ended december  and  or of our licensing revenue and of our total net revenue for the year ended december  licensing revenue from delphi primarily resulted from the recognition of deferred licensing revenue which was received in product revenue was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  a decrease of  resulting from the implementation of our new business model  which called for transitioning away from switch manufacturing 
our revenue in was primarily generated from designing  developing  and producing prototypes of customer switch applications and low volume production runs 
additionally  we had been performing pursuant to a long term purchase order with siemens building technologies  inc this purchase order was completed in the second quarter of and generated of our product revenue for the year ended december  this project has been transitioned to one of our licensees 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold was  for  compared to  for  a decrease of  the decrease in cost of goods sold reflected our transition from the low margin business of manufacturing to the high margin business of licensing 
licensing cost of sales for was  compared to  in  an increase of  reflecting the growth of our licensing business 
product cost of goods sold was  in compared to  in  a decrease of  the decrease in product cost of goods sold was primarily due to our transition to a licensing business model from a manufacturing model 
the decrease in overall cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenue was primarily due to the higher gross margins we achieved through our licensing agreements and decreased manufacturing costs by utilizing our licensees and subcontractors for manufacturing 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  for  compared to  for  an increase of  the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily related to costs associated with the former chief executive officer s resignation 
under the terms of his agreement  in the event of resignation  he was entitled to salary and benefits for an month period 
as a result  we recorded a charge of  in costs associated with additional sales and administrative personnel during also contributed to the increase 
research and development 
research and development expenses were  for  compared to  for  an increase of  the increase was primarily attributable to costs related to additional research and development personnel  expanded modeling and testing capabilities and related occupancy costs 
loss from operations 
as a result of the factors described above  the loss from operations was  for  compared to  for  an increase of  other income net 
other income net was  for  compared to  for  a decrease of  the decrease in other income net was due to the decrease in investment income as a result of lower interest rates and lower average cash balances 
net loss 
as a result of the factors described above  the net loss was  for  compared to  for  an increase of liquidity and capital resources we had cash and cash equivalents of  on december  during the past two years  we have experienced decreases in our cash and cash equivalents primarily as a result of cash used in operations offset by the proceeds from the stock sales related to the exercise of employee stock options 
during  we experienced an increase in our cash and cash equivalents primarily due to our equity transactions with delphi and our licensing agreement with delphi 
see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
net cash used in operating activities during the year ended december  was  cash used in operating activities consisted primarily of the net loss and a decrease in deferred licensing revenue of  partially offset by depreciation and amortization of  net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december  was  our net cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of investments in patents and purchases of computer equipment  modeling and test equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december  was  consisting primarily of net proceeds from the sale of stock related to the exercise of employee stock options  offset by principal payments on debt and lease obligations 
our license agreement with delphi requires delphi to pay us minimum royalty payments  beginning july   totaling million during the initial seven year term ending june  delphi can maintain exclusivity for the automotive industry through june  by making additional minimum annual royalty payments during that period 
after june   either party may convert the agreement to a non exclusive agreement through at december   we had approximately million in net operating loss carryforwards available for federal and state income tax purposes 
we have not recognized any benefit from these operating loss carryforwards  which expire in through we have employment and separation agreements with our executive officers 
these agreements call for a base salary and bonuses based upon our performance 
these agreements also provide for salary and benefits in the event of separation 
effective december   our former chief executive officer resigned his position 
his employment agreement provided for salary and benefits in the event of termination or resignation 
as such  we recorded a charge of  during the year ended december  to be paid over an month period 
at december    remained to be paid 
we have experienced significant operating losses since our inception 
in october  we announced cost cutting initiatives that included significant reductions in personnel 
the announced personnel reductions were completed by the end of the fourth quarter of we anticipate that our cash and working capital requirements will decrease in from historical levels 
however  our capital expenditures and working capital requirements could increase depending on our operating results and other adjustments to our operating plan as may be needed to respond to competition or unexpected events 
we believe that our cash on hand will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least months 
we continually evaluate our working capital needs and we may seek to obtain additional working capital through debt or equity offerings 
there can be no assurance that additional funds will be available on acceptable terms 
in the event that additional funds are not available on acceptable terms  we could be required to reduce the scope of or cease operations 
the following table sets forth our contractual obligations and commitments as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations less than year years thereafter total capital lease obligations   operating leases    purchase order obligations   total contractual cash obligations    our purchase order obligations represent open commitments to acquire licensed components within the next twelve months 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange and interest rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage these risks and do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
we are currently exposed to credit risk on credit extended to our licensees 
based on the credit worthiness of our licensee base and the relative size of these financial instruments  we believe the risk associated with these instruments will not have a material adverse affect on our business  financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
additionally  we are exposed to some market risk through interest rates related to our investment of cash and cash equivalents of approximately million 
the risk is not considered material and we manage such risk by evaluating the best investment rates available for short term high quality investments 
presently  all of our receivables and substantially all of our payments are denominated in us dollars and  consequently  we believe we have no foreign currency exchange rate risk 
however  in the future  we may enter into agreements in foreign currencies that may subject us to foreign exchange rate risk 
there can be no assurance that our future efforts to reduce foreign exchange risk will be successful
