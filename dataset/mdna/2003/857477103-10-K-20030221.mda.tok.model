operating expenses were billion  an increase of million  or over adjusted for the formation of citistreet  operating expenses grew  significantly lower than the comparable expense growth in over the year over year growth in expenses reflects higher salaries and employee benefits expense  partially offset by lower incentive based compensation  and higher information systems and communications expense 
salaries and employee benefits expense increased million in  or million when adjusted for the formation of citistreet 
the adjusted increase reflects more than  additional staff to support the large client wins and new business from existing clients and acquisitions 
this expense increase was partially offset by lower incentive based compensation 
information systems and communications expense was million in  up from the prior year 
adjusted for the formation of citistreet  information systems and communications expense increased 
this growth reflects both continuing investment in software and hardware  as well as the technology costs associated with increased staffing levels 
expenses related to transaction processing services were million  down million  or 
these expenses are volume related and include external contract services  subcustodian fees  brokerage services and fees related to securities settlement 
lower mutual fund shareholder activities  and lower subcustodian fees resulting from both the decline in asset values and lower transaction volumes  drove the decline 
occupancy expense was million  up 
the increase is due to expenses necessary to support state street s global growth  and expenses incurred for leasehold improvements and other operational costs 
other expenses were million  up million from these expenses include professional services and advertising and sales promotion 
the increase over prior year is due to a million increase in the amortization of goodwill  primarily from acquisitions in state street s cost containment efforts  which reduced discretionary spending  partially offset the increase in other expenses 
income tax expense was million in  down from million in tax expense for included a benefit of million for the write off of state street s investment in bridge 
in  the effective tax rate  excluding the write off of bridge  was compared to in state street corporation lines of business state street reports two lines of business investment servicing and investment management 
given the nature of state street s services and management organization  the results of operations for these lines of business are not necessarily comparable with those of other companies 
revenue and expenses are directly charged or allocated to the lines of business through algorithm based management information systems 
state street prices its products and services on total client relationships and other factors  therefore  revenue may not necessarily reflect market pricing on products within the business lines in the same way as it would for independent business entities 
assets and liabilities are allocated according to rules that support management s strategic and tactical goals 
capital is allocated based on risk weighted assets employed and management s judgment 
the capital allocations may not be representative of the capital that might be required if these lines of business were independent business entities 
state street measures its line of business results on an operating basis

total revenue in increased to billion  up million  or less than from servicing fees  brokerage fees and gains on the sales of available for sale securities drove revenue growth  largely offset by declines in foreign exchange trading revenue and net interest revenue 
growth in servicing fees primarily reflects new business from existing and new clients  including clients gained from an acquisition in july growth in servicing fees was constrained by lower securities lending revenue and lower equity market valuations in compared to growth in brokerage fees reflected higher equity trading volumes by investment managers  including commission recapture and transition management services 
higher gains on the sales of available for sale securities reflected opportunities created by continued declines in market yields on fixed income securities 
foreign exchange trading revenue was down million from  reflecting decreased currency volatility and customer trades 
net interest revenue after provision for loan losses declined million from due to lower yields on reinvested assets  offset somewhat by balance sheet growth and lower liability costs

financial goals and factors that may affect them state street s primary financial goal is sustainable real growth in earnings per share 
the corporation has two supporting goals  one for total revenue growth and one for return on common stockholders equity roe 
the long term revenue goal is a real inflation adjusted compound annual growth rate of revenue for through at present  this equates to approximately a nominal compound annual growth rate 
the annual roe goal is 
state street considers these to be financial goals  not projections or forward looking statements 
however  the discussion in this financial review  and in other portions of the annual report  may contain statements that are considered forward looking statements within the meaning of us federal securities laws 
these statements may be identified by such forward looking terminology as expect  look  believe  anticipate  may  will  or similar statements or variations of such terms 
the corporation s financial goals and such forward looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties  including the issues and factors listed below and factors further described in conjunction with the forward looking information  which could cause actual results to differ materially 
the following issues and factors should be carefully considered 
the forward looking statements contained in the annual report speak only as of the time the statements were given 
the corporation does not undertake to revise those forward looking statements to reflect events after the date of this report

future revenue may increase or decrease depending upon the extent of increases or decreases in cross border investments made by clients 
economic and political uncertainties resulting from terrorist attacks  subsequent military actions or other events could result in decreased cross border investment activities

state street generally benefits when individuals invest their savings in mutual funds and other collective funds or in defined contribution plans 
changes in savings rates or investment styles may affect revenue 
if there is a decline in the savings rates of individuals  or if there is a change in investment preferences that leads to fewer investments in mutual funds  other collective funds  and defined contribution plans  state street s revenue may be adversely affected

as asset values in worldwide financial markets increase or decrease  state street s opportunities to invest and service financial assets may change 
since a portion of the corporation s fees are based on the value of assets under custody and management  fluctuations in the valuation of worldwide securities markets will affect revenue 
state street estimates  based on a study conducted in  that a increase or decrease in worldwide equity values would cause a corresponding change in state street s total revenue of approximately 
if fixed income security values worldwide were to increase or decrease by  state street would anticipate a corresponding change of approximately in its total revenue

changes in markets served  including the growth rate of collective funds worldwide  outsourcing decisions  mergers  acquisitions and consolidations among clients and competitors and the pace of debt issuance  can affect revenue 
in general  state street benefits from increases in the volume of financial market transactions serviced 
state street provides services worldwide 
global and regional economic factors and changes or potential changes in laws and regulations affecting the corporation s business including volatile currencies  the pace of inflation  changes in monetary policy  changes in domestic and international banking supervisory regulations including capital requirements  and social and political instability could affect results of operations 
for example  the significant slowing of economic growth globally is affecting worldwide equity values and business growth 
the terrorist attacks that took place in the united states on september   and subsequent military and terrorist activities  have caused economic and political uncertainties 
these activities  the national and global efforts to combat terrorism  and other potential military activities and outbreaks of hostilities have affected and may further adversely affect economic growth  and may have other adverse effects on many companies  including state street  in ways that are not predictable 
in a similar manner  financial reporting irregularities involving large and well known companies may have other adverse effects on state street in ways which are not predictable 
in addition  state street cannot predict the final form of  or the effects of  the regulatory accord on international banking institutions to be reached by the basel committee on banking supervision 
legislation may cause changes in the competitive environment in which state street operates  which could include  among other things  broadening the scope of activities of significant competitors  facilitating consolidation of competitors into stronger entities  or attracting large and well capitalized new competitors into state street s traditional businesses 
such factors and changes and the ability of the corporation to address and adapt to the regulatory and competitive challenges may affect future results of operations 
a c c o u n t i n g p o l i c i e s 
changes in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states applicable to state street could have a material impact on the corporation s reported results of operations 
while such changes may not have an economic impact on the business of state street  these changes could affect the attainment of the current measures of the corporation s financial goals 
i n t e r e s t r a t e s 
the levels of market interest rates  the shape of the yield curve and the direction of interest rate changes relative to the currency mix of the corporation s interest bearing assets and liabilities affect net interest revenue and securities lending revenue  which is recorded in both servicing and management fees 
in the short term  state street s net interest revenue and securities lending revenue benefit from falling interest rates and are negatively affected by rising rates because interest bearing liabilities reprice sooner than interest earning assets 
sustained lower interest rates and a flat yield curve may have a constraining effect on the net interest revenue and securities lending revenue growth

any occurrence that may limit the corporation s access to the funds markets  such as a decline in the confidence of debt purchasers  depositors or counterparties participating in the funds markets in general or with state street in particular  or a downgrade of state street s debt rating  may adversely affect state street s ability to raise capital and  in turn  its liquidity 
c a p i t a l 
under regulatory capital adequacy guidelines  state street and state street bank must meet guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items  subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements could have a direct material effect on state street s financial condition  failure to maintain the status of well capitalized under the regulatory framework could affect state street s status as a financial holding company and eligibility for a streamlined review process for acquisition proposals 
in addition  failure to maintain the status of well capitalized could affect the confidence of state street s clients in the corporation and could adversely affect its business 
also  under federal reserve board regulations and related federal laws  there are limits on investment of the capital and surplus of state street bank in subsidiaries that  in general  conduct only international activities 
state street bank is near the limit on such permitted use of capital and surplus 
this limit may affect the pace of future international expansion by state street bank through these subsidiaries  although there are available alternatives for international expansion by state street and state street bank 
this limit may not have a similar impact on those competitors of the corporation which are significantly larger than state street and state street bank 
v o l a t i l i t y o f c u r r e n c y m a r k e t s 
the degree of volatility in foreign exchange rates can affect the amount of foreign exchange trading revenue 
in general  state street benefits from currency volatility 
accordingly  foreign exchange revenue is likely to decrease during times of decreased currency volatility 
p a c e o f p e n s i o n r e f o r m 
state street expects its business to benefit from worldwide pension reform that creates additional pools of assets that use custody and related services  and investment management services 
the pace of pension reform and resulting programs  including public and private pension schemes  may affect the pace of revenue growth 
if the pace of pension reform and resulting programs  including public and private pension schemes  slows down or if pension reform does not occur  then revenue growth may be adversely affected 
p r i c i n g c o m p e t i t i o n 
future prices the corporation is able to obtain for its products may increase or decrease from current levels depending upon demand for its products  its competitors activities and the introduction of new products into the marketplace 
p a c e o f n e w b u s i n e s s  b u s i n e s s m i x 
a decline in the pace at which state street attracts new clients  and the pace at which existing and new clients use additional services and assign additional assets to state street for management or custody  will adversely affect future results of operations 
a decline in the rate at which clients outsource functions such as their internal accounting activities  would also adversely affect results of operations 
in addition  changes in business mix and in the source of revenue  including the mix of us and us business  may affect future results of operations  depending on the economic conditions of those geographic areas at the time 
b u s i n e s s c o n t i n u i t y 
state street has business continuity and disaster recovery plans in place 
however  events  including terrorist or military actions and resulting political and social turmoil  could arise that would cause unforeseen damage to state street s physical facilities or could cause delays or disruptions to operational functions  including information processing and financial market settlement functions 
additionally  state street s clients  vendors and counterparties could suffer from such events 
should these events affect state street  or the clients  vendors or counterparties with which it conducts business  state street s results of operations could be adversely affected

technological change often creates opportunities for product differentiation and reduced costs  as well as the possibility of increased expenses 
developments in the securities processing industry  including shortened settlement cycles and straight through processing  will result in changes to existing procedures 
alternative delivery systems have emerged  including the widespread use of the internet 
state street s financial performance depends in part on its ability to develop and market new and innovative services  and to adopt or develop new technologies that differentiate state street s products or provide cost efficiencies 
the risks inherent in this process include rapid technological change in the industry  the corporation s ability to access technical and other information from clients  and the significant and ongoing investments required to bring new services to market in a timely fashion at competitive prices 
a further risk is the introduction by competitors of services that could replace or provide lower cost alternatives to state street services 
state street uses trademark  trade secret  copyright and other proprietary rights procedures to protect its technology  and has applied for a limited number of patents in connection with certain software programs 
despite these efforts  state street cannot be certain that the steps taken by it to prevent unauthorized use of proprietary rights are sufficient to prevent misappropriation of technology  particularly outside the united states where laws or law enforcement practices may not protect proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
in addition  no assurance can be given that the courts will adequately enforce contractual agreements that state street has entered into to protect its proprietary technology 
if any of its proprietary information were misappropriated by or otherwise disclosed to its competitors  state street s competitive position could be adversely affected 
in the event a third party asserts a claim of infringement of its proprietary rights  obtained through patents or otherwise  against the corporation  state street may be required to spend significant resources to defend against such claims  develop a non infringing program or process  or obtain a license to the infringed process

acquisitions of complementary businesses and technologies and development of strategic alliances and divestitures of portions of its business are an active part of state street s overall business strategy 
the corporation has completed several acquisitions  alliances and divestitures in recent years 
however  there can be no assurance that services  technologies  key personnel or businesses of acquired companies will be effectively assimilated into state street s business or service offerings or that alliances will be successful 
in addition  state street may not be able to successfully complete any divestiture on satisfactory terms  if at all  and divestitures may result in a reduction of total revenue and net income 
state street corporation financial condition balance sheet state street provides deposit and other balance sheet services to its institutional investor clients 
in executing their worldwide cash management activities  state street s clients use short term investments and deposit accounts that comprise the majority of state street s liabilities 
these client investment activities affect the corporation s approach to managing interest rate sensitivity  liquidity and credit risk

there were  stockholders of record of common stock as of december  risk management in providing services for institutional investors globally  state street must manage and control certain inherent risks 
these include counterparty risk  credit risk  fiduciary risk  operations and settlement risk  and market risk 
risk management is an integral part of state street s business activities and is centrally organized with close ties to the business units 
this structure allows for corporate risk management across the business areas while individual line areas remain responsible for risk management in their units 
while state street believes its risk management process is effective in managing the risks of its business  no system can eliminate all risks 
if there is a material failure in the risks managed by state street  such as a material counterparty failure or a material default of a debtor  state street s results of operations could be adversely affected 
state street maintains a system of internal controls that are designed to minimize risk 
management believes these internal controls are adequate to minimize such risk 
this internal control environment is evaluated on an annual basis through a sas review of most of the business units and through a report on the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting as required by the fdic improvement act of risk management emphasizes establishing specific authorization levels and limits 
exposure levels are reviewed and modified as required by changing conditions 
analysis of business risk concentration includes specific industry concentrations of credit risk  country limits and individual counterparty limits 
in managing country risk  state street considers a variety of issues  including those related to credit quality  asset concentration  liquidity and settlement risk 
credit risk results from the possibility that a loss may occur if a counterparty becomes unable to meet the terms of a contract 
state street has policies and procedures to monitor and manage all aspects of credit risk 
these include a comprehensive credit review and approval process that involves the assignment of risk ratings to all loans and off balance sheet credit exposures 
rigorous processes for credit approval cover traditional credit facilities  foreign exchange  placements  credit enhancement services  securities lending and securities clearing facilities 
fiduciary risk is the risk of financial loss as a consequence of breaching a fiduciary duty to a client 
business units are responsible for operating within the rules and regulations applicable to their activities  including any corporate guidelines 
the corporate fiduciary review committee and the compliance committee work with the business units to oversee adherence to corporate standards 
state street is a large servicer and manager of financial assets on a global scale  therefore  oversight of operational and settlement risk is an integral part of the management process throughout the corporation 
state street focuses on payment system risk management  overdraft monitoring and control  and global securities clearing and settlement 
in addition to specific authorization levels and limits  operational risk is mitigated by automation  standardized operating procedures  segregation of duties and controls  timely confirmation and reconciliation procedures  and insurance 
state street corporation market risk foreign exchange and interest rate sensitivity state street engages in trading and investment activities to serve clients investment and trading needs  which contribute to overall corporate earnings and enhances liquidity 
in the conduct of these activities  the corporation is subject to  and assumes  market risk 
market risk is the risk of adverse financial impact due to changes in market prices  such as interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
the level of risk state street assumes is a function of the corporation s overall objectives and liquidity needs  client requirements  and market volatility 
state street manages its overall market risk through a comprehensive risk management framework 
this structure includes a market risk management group that reports independently to senior management 
market risk from foreign exchange and trading activities is controlled through established limits on aggregate and net open positions  sensitivity to changes in interest rates  and concentrations 
these limits are supplemented by stop loss thresholds 
the corporation uses a variety of risk management tools and techniques  including value at risk  to measure  monitor and control market risk 
all limits and measurement techniques are reviewed and adjusted as necessary on a regular basis by business managers  the market risk management group and senior management 
state street uses foreign exchange contracts and a variety of financial derivative instruments to support clients needs  conduct trading activities  and manage its interest rate and currency risk 
these activities are designed to create trading revenue or hedge net interest revenue 
in addition  the corporation provides services related to derivative instruments in its role as both a manager and servicer of financial assets 
state street s clients use derivatives to manage the financial risks associated with their investment goals and business activities 
with the growth of cross border investing  clients have an increasing need for foreign exchange forward contracts to convert currency for international investment and to manage the currency risk in international investment portfolios 
as an active participant in the foreign exchange markets  state street provides foreign exchange forward contracts and over the counter options in support of these client needs 
trading activities foreign exchange and interest rate sensitivity as part of its trading activities  the corporation assumes positions in both the foreign exchange and interest rate markets by buying and selling cash instruments and using financial derivatives  including foreign exchange forward contracts  foreign exchange and interest rate options  and interest rate swaps 
as of december   the notional amounts of these derivative instruments was billion  of which billion were foreign exchange forward contracts 
long and short foreign exchange forward positions are closely matched to minimize currency and interest rate risk 
all foreign exchange contracts are valued daily at current market rates 
the corporation uses a variety of risk measurement and estimation techniques  including value at risk 
value at risk is an estimate of potential loss for a given period of time within a stated statistical confidence interval 
state street uses a risk management system  askari riskbook  to estimate value at risk daily for all material trading positions 
the corporation has adopted standards for estimating value at risk  and maintains capital for market risk  in accordance with the federal reserve s capital adequacy guidelines for market risk 
value at risk is estimated for a one tail confidence interval and an assumed one day holding period using a historical observation period of greater than one year 
a one tail confidence interval implies that daily trading losses should not exceed the estimated value at risk more than of the time  or approximately three days out of the year 
the methodology uses a simulation approach based on observed changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates and takes into account the resulting diversification benefits provided from the mix of the corporation s trading positions 
like all quantitative risk measures  value at risk is subject to certain limitations and assumptions inherent to the methodology 
state street s methodology gives equal weight to all market rate observations regardless of how recently the market rates were observed 
the estimate is calculated using static portfolios consisting of positions held at the end of the trading day 
implicit in the estimate is the assumption that no intraday action is taken by state street corporation management during adverse market movements 
as a result  the methodology does not represent risk associated with intraday changes in positions or intraday price volatility 
the following table presents state street s market risk for its trading activities as measured by its value at risk methodology v a l u e a t r i s k f o r t h e y e a r e n d e d d e c e m b e r dollars in millions average maximum minimum foreign exchange products interest rate products foreign exchange products 

interest rate products state street compares actual daily profit and losses from trading activities to estimated one day value at risk 
during and  state street did not experience any trading losses in excess of its end of day value at risk estimate 
non trading activities currency risk state street had billion of non us dollar denominated non trading assets as of december   which were funded by non us dollar denominated deposits 
state street s non us dollar denominated non trading assets included currencies 
approximately of these assets were in eight major currencies 
since non trading assets are generally invested in the same currency in which the initial deposits are received  the risk associated with changes to currency exchange rates is minimal 
to the extent that deposits are not reinvested in the same currency  the resulting net currency positions are managed as part of trading risk as discussed above 
in general  the maturities of these non trading assets and liabilities are short term 
to the extent duration mismatches exist  they are managed as part of state street s consolidated asset liability management activities  and the related market risk is included in the following non trading interest rate sensitivity disclosure 
non trading activities interest rate sensitivity the objective of interest rate sensitivity management is to provide sustainable net interest revenue under various economic environments and to protect asset values from adverse effects of changes in interest rates 
state street manages the structure of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities by adjusting the mix  yields and maturity or repricing characteristics based on market conditions 
since interest bearing sources of funds are predominantly short term  state street maintains a generally short term structure for its interest earning assets  including money market assets  investments and loans 
interest rate swaps are used minimally as part of overall asset and liability management to augment state street s management of interest rate exposure 
state street uses three tools for measuring interest rate risk simulation  duration and gap analysis 
key assumptions in the simulation  duration and gap models include the timing of cash flows  maturity and repricing of financial instruments  changes in market conditions  capital planning  and deposit sensitivity 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and as a result  the models cannot precisely calculate net interest revenue or precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest revenue and economic value 
actual results may differ from simulated results due to the timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions and management strategies  among other factors 
state street corporation simulation models facilitate the evaluation of the potential range of net interest revenue under a most likely scenario  alternative interest rate scenarios and rate shock tests 
based upon results of the simulation model as of december   there would be a decrease in net interest revenue of million over the following months for an immediate basis point increase in all global interest rates 
if interest rates immediately decreased by basis points  the model shows an increase in net interest revenue of less than million 
duration measures the change in the economic value of assets and liabilities for given changes in interest rates 
based upon the results of the duration model as of december   there would be a decrease in the economic value of assets  net of liabilities  of million  or 
of assets  as a result of an immediate increase in all global interest rates of basis points 
in the event of an immediate decrease of basis points to interest rates  the model shows an increase of million  or 
of assets  to the economic value of assets  net of liabilities 
the third measure of interest rate risk  gap analysis  is the difference in asset and liability repricing on a cumulative basis within a specified time period 
as of year end  interest bearing liabilities reprice faster than interest earning assets over the next months  as has been typical for state street 
if all other variables remained constant  in the short term  falling interest rates would lead to net interest revenue that is higher than it would otherwise have been 
rising rates would lead to lower net interest revenue 
other important determinants of net interest revenue are balance sheet size and mix  interest rate spreads  the slope of the yield curve  and rate levels 
off balance sheet activities assets under custody and assets under management are held in a fiduciary or custodial capacity for state street s clients and are not recorded on the corporation s balance sheet in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
similarly  collateral funds resulting from state street s securities lending services are held by state street as agent  therefore  under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  these assets are not assets of the corporation 
state street sells and distributes securities for two types of variable interest entities vies  formerly reported as special purpose entities  that are not included in the consolidated financial statements of the corporation 
one type  which state street has administered since  issues asset backed commercial paper abcp that is rated p by moody s investors service and or a or better by standard poor s 
state street and unrelated dealers sell and distribute the commercial paper issued by the vies 
the commercial paper represents debt issued by the vies 
state street holds no equity ownership interest in these vies  which are structured as bankruptcy remote corporations 
the assets of these vies include investment securities and purchased receivables that back the commercial paper 
such assets are transferred to the vies by unrelated third parties 
state street provides liquidity and credit enhancement facilities in the forms of liquidity asset purchase agreements  lines of credit  and standby letters of credit to the vies 
at december   state street s commitments under liquidity asset purchase agreements and lines of credit to these vies were billion  and standby letters of credit were million  none of which were utilized 
amounts committed  but unused  under the liquidity asset purchase agreements  lines of credit  and standby letters of credit that state street provides to these vies are included in the disclosures in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
asset performance deterioration may cause the asset risk to shift from the abcp investors to state street as the liquidity provider for the asset as the vie may need to repay maturing commercial paper by drawing the liquidity facilities 
fee revenue for administration  liquidity facilities and credit enhancements was million in at december   these abcp programs had total commercial paper outstanding of billion in a combined u 
s  european and australian abcp market estimated at billion 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information on recent accounting pronouncements that could affect the off balance sheet status of these vie s 
state street corporation for a second type of vie  structured as a qualified special purpose entity in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  state street distributes and sells equity interests in tax exempt investment grade assets that are primarily sold to mutual fund clients 
for these vies  state street transfers the assets from its investment portfolio at fair market value 
such transfers are treated as sales 
the vies finance the acquisition of these assets from state street by selling equity interests to third party investors 
state street owns a minority residual interest in these vies of less than  or million 
as of december   these trusts have a weighted average life of approximately years 
in a separate agreement  state street provides liquidity asset purchase agreements to these entities 
these liquidity asset purchase agreements obligate state street to buy the equity interests in the underlying portfolio at par value  which approximates market value  in the event that the re marketing agent is unable to place the equity interests of the vie with investors 
the liquidity asset purchase agreements are subject to early termination by state street in the event of payment default  bankruptcy of issuer or credit enhancement provider  taxability  or downgrade of an asset below investment grade 
fee revenue for administrative services  liquidity asset purchase agreements and residual interest earnings totaled million in  before tax benefit 
in connection with state street s balance sheet management activities  the corporation incurred million of interest expense on interest rate swap contracts designated as fair value hedges against the minority residual interest of the vies 
as of december   these vies had total assets of billion in a tax exempt market estimated at billion 
state street s liquidity asset purchase agreements to these vies were billion at december   none of which were utilized  and are included in the disclosures in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the risks associated with providing administration  liquidity  and or credit enhancements to both types of vies are reviewed in state street s corporate risk management process in a manner that is consistent with applicable policies and guidelines 
state street believes that it has sufficient liquidity and has provided adequate operating and credit reserves to cover any risks associated with these activities 
new accounting developments information related to new accounting pronouncements appears in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting estimates critical accounting estimates are those that require management to make assumptions that are difficult  subjective or complex about matters that are uncertain and may change in subsequent periods  resulting in changes to reported results 
state street s significant accounting policies are described in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the majority of these accounting policies do not require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates or the variability of the estimates is not material 
however  the following policies could be deemed critical 
state street s management has discussed these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
lease financing state street has a leveraged lease financing portfolio  including lease in lease out structures  consisting of us and cross border financings for transportation equipment  including trains  aircraft and ships 
state street has provided lease financing services since  and at december   the portfolio aggregated billion  and is reflected in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
this portfolio is recorded net of non recourse debt  and revenue is recognized as interest revenue 
interest revenue from the lease portfolio was million in considering the long term  cross border nature of many of these leases and the number of assumptions  including residual values  cash flows and income tax regulations and rates  there is risk associated with this revenue should any of these assumptions change in future periods 
state street corporation contingencies and other reserves state street has established reserves for risk of losses  including loan losses and tax contingencies 
the allowance for loan losses represents state street s estimate of the probable losses that have occurred as of the date of the financial statements  as further described in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in the normal course of business  state street is subject to challenges from us and us tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
these challenges may result in adjustments of the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions 
management believes state street has appropriately accrued for tax exposures including lease in lease out structures and real estate investment trust reit dividends received deductions 
if state street prevails in a matter for which an accrual has been established or is required to pay an amount exceeding its reserves  the financial impact will be reflected in the period in which the matter is resolved 
in addition  state street must manage and control certain inherent risks in the normal course of its business 
these include counterparty risk  credit risk  fiduciary risk  operations and settlement risk  and market risk 
see the risk management section of this financial review and note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
revenue recognition revenue from investment servicing  management  foreign exchange trading  brokerage and processing are recognized when earned based on contractual terms and are accrued based on estimates  or are recognized as transactions occur or services are provided 
revenue on interest earning assets is recognized based on the effective yield of the financial instrument 
revenue recognition for servicing and management fees involves the use of estimates and assumptions  including components that are calculated based on estimated asset valuations and transaction volumes 
while these estimates and assumptions could be considered complex  state street has long standing controls and processes in place to ensure the accuracy of revenue accruals 
historically  revenue recognized using these processes has fairly matched revenue billed and collected 
furthermore  state street s fee revenue recognition is promptly validated by timely invoicing and cash collection from clients and counterparties 
during  state street recognized servicing and management fee revenue totaling billion 
of this amount  million was in the billing and or collection process at december  pension accounting state street and certain of its subsidiaries participate in a non contributory defined benefit plan 
in addition to the primary plan  state street has non qualified supplemental plans that provide certain officers with defined pension benefits in excess of allowable qualified plan limits 
non us employees participate in local plans 
the reported liability associated with these plans is dependent on many factors such as the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and a series of actuarial assumptions 
management determines these estimates based upon currently available market and industry data  historical performance of the plan and its assets  and consultation with the corporation s actuaries 
management believes the estimates and assumptions used to determine the reported benefit obligation and pension expense are reasonable and are reflective of the terms of the plans in the current economic environment based upon information from the best available resources 
the projected benefit obligation for the primary and non us defined benefit plans was million  and the plan assets were million as of december  pension expense in future years is affected by the variance of the assumed rate of return from the actual return on plan assets 
this variance is amortized over future years 
a change in the actual return on plan assets or the discount rate would affect state street s earnings by less than 
per share 
for more information on the corporation s plans  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
state street corporation letter to our stockholders the year was an unusually challenging time for investors with difficult conditions in nearly every investment category around the world 
global political tensions weakened economies and financial markets  and a regular stream of news about corporate governance scandals seriously undermined investor confidence 
equity values  as measured by the s p  fell to their lowest level in at least five years 
cross border investing slowed down significantly  despite a brief pick up in the second quarter 
and interest rates were significantly lower than in the previous year 
financial results against these strong headwinds  i m happy to say that state street was able to achieve positive financial results exceeding our primary goal of sustainable real growth in earnings per share 
operating earnings per share  driven by new business from existing and new clients  increased in and we were successful in managing our operating costs  decreasing expenses by 
we continue to differentiate ourselves by stating a goal for revenue growth 
our goal is to achieve real compound annual growth from through  although we do not expect to achieve that rate every year in the ten year period 
our supporting goal for return on stockholders equity is to achieve annually 
in  due to slower revenue growth  we delivered operating roe of 
cash dividends declared in increased from business highlights state street s strong financial results for the year are the outcome of two achievements we increased our revenue by winning new business with especially strong growth outside the united states and we continued to keep tight control of our expenses 
on the expense side  we were aggressive in eliminating spending for things that didn t add enough value to our business proposition 
we took a strategic approach to leveraging efficiencies in corporate purchasing and our day to day operations 
we reduced staff in administrative and professional services areas 
overall  we reduced expenses from  after adjusting for goodwill 
in addition to keeping our focus with regard to profitability while providing consistently excellent service to our clients we took a number of steps aimed at positioning state street for future growth 
the most noteworthy of these steps was our decision to purchase most of deutsche bank ag s global securities services business 
this business  which will be substantially integrated by  brings enormous benefits to state street 
it cements our standing as the global leader in investment servicing positioning us at the center of europe s high growth investment services market and giving us new clients  employees and offices in the asia pacific region 
it brings us expanded depotbank capabilities in europe and the wm company s performance measurement tools 
and not inconsequentially in this environment it provides us with substantial economies of scale and scope 
although our agreement with deutsche bank was the biggest news event for us in  it was only one of many investments we made in state street s future 
another important investment was the acquisition of international fund services ifs  a leading global provider of services for alternative investment portfolios such as hedge funds 
this acquisition broadened state street s capabilities in serving the expanding requirements of sophisticated global investors 
we also began to develop services specifically geared to the needs of asset managers who serve private clients and managed accounts 
these investment management firms are operating in a highly competitive marketplace and therefore are looking for ways to differentiate themselves with new products and services 
by outsourcing state street corporation administrative functions to state street  these asset managers are freed up to focus on their core competencies  confident that the services state street provides to them will be both innovative and reliable 
our ongoing process of fine tuning our focus also involves making selective changes to our business mix 
we completed the sale of our corporate trust business in outlook for i think it s safe to predict that will be another tough year for our clients and for state street 
we are well positioned not only to weather this current storm but also to emerge from it even stronger 
that s because we have built our business around the idea of focus 
we focus on serving the needs of a single group of clients sophisticated global investors 
within this market segment  we focus on ensuring that we re the best provider and that we re flexible enough to take maximum advantage of developments that present our clients and state street with opportunities for growth 
one long term trend that continues to offer enormous potential for us is a mounting sense of urgency about retirement security  driven by increasing life expectancy in most parts of the world 
as governments and employers develop new ways to help workers invest for their retirements  they are creating new  large pools of assets that must be managed and serviced 
state street is a world leader in managing and servicing retirement funds 
we are also in an excellent position to benefit from changing patterns in the way people save and invest 
in this difficult environment  investors have become more risk averse a trend that plays to the strengths of our investment management arm  state street global advisors 
we offer a broad range of risk controlled investment management options  including enhanced indexing  which offers higher returns than passive investment schemes with only slightly more risk 
a third trend that benefits state street is convergence in the financial services industry 
the large  global companies that are emerging from mergers and acquisitions are looking for a trusted partner who can offer what they need  in any part of the world 
their needs coincide perfectly with our strengths our rich experience in developing and implementing comprehensive solutions for our clients across the globe 


and our ability  using technology  to provide services that are truly scalable 
i believe that we will continue to win a disproportionate share of new business in primarily because we re very clear about our corporate purpose to make our clients successful 
if our clients succeed  we will succeed too 
nothing is more important to us than continuing to earn the trust of our clients each and every day 
strategic priorities our attention is firmly fixed on a goal we established a long time ago sustainable growth 
sustainability is a key idea here and  for a company that is more than years old  it has real meaning 
we understand that true success comes not from a single stroke of brilliance but from the accumulated results of many sound  strategic decisions that are executed extremely well by talented professionals 
within this philosophical framework  we have five strategic priorities 
one of these priorities is to continue to provide our clients with the best investment solutions  and the best service  it is possible to give 
we re limited in this endeavor only by the current boundaries of technology and we re extending those limits every day 
a second priority is to continue to grow as a global company 
the acquisition of deutsche bank s global securities services business dramatically expands our global presence 
but this acquisition only accelerates growth that has been under way for more than a decade 
global growth opportunities for us include the development of new products  as well as physical expansion into new countries and markets 
in the united kingdom and europe  we will focus on continuing to broaden the range of integrated solutions we offer our clients 
in asia  we will state street corporation continue to specialize in serving the needs of governments and government agencies something state street does better than anyone else 
a third priority is to continue to improve our profit margins an especially important objective in this challenging environment 
we re concentrating on both sides of the equation increasing our revenue and controlling our expenses 
our growing client base gives us advantages in this area  both in terms of opportunities to sell more services and in opportunities to leverage economies of scale 
a fourth priority is to foster continued innovation in serving the emerging needs of global investors by adapting traditional business models to changing conditions 
while a great deal of our growth will continue to come from providing technology  transaction and information services for large investors  we see a new source of growth in providing a broader suite of services to the front office 
we plan to launch new equity execution capabilities early in we will also continue to expand our investment management product line to include new strategies in the quantitative active category 
a final priority is to offer our employees ample opportunities for personal and professional growth 
as our employees learn new skills  gain new experiences and perspectives and become more satisfied in their work  they ll be motivated to achieve great things for state street which  in turn  will create even better opportunities for them 
this virtuous cycle has always been part of the state street culture  and we have proven time and again that it works 
executing on our strategic priorities will be a complex and challenging task 
to maintain and deepen our leadership position  we must be successful in both finding the best opportunities to grow and in continuously shifting our resources to align them with these opportunities 
we are more confident than ever that our core strategy focusing on being the partner sophisticated global investors trust most to help them succeed is a sound approach to long term growth 
i want to thank my state street colleagues around the world for your hard work and outstanding results in i also want to thank our stockholders for your continued support 
sincerely  s david a 
spina david a 
spina chairman and chief executive officer state street corporation continuing to grow in a challenging market environment  what is state street s strategy for continued growth we have a very clear strategy for achieving long term growth 
it s built around the concept of focus 
we re focused exclusively on sophisticated global investors 
we believe this client segment offers superior opportunities for growth 
it s also one we are uniquely equipped to serve 
we re focused on providing everything sophisticated global investors need to invest successfully 
our aim is to offer integrated solutions that cover the entire investment cycle  from research and analytics to multi asset class trade execution to fund accounting and administration 
our development efforts target products that offer our clients the strongest growth potential in today s market environment 
we re also focused on strengthening our presence in high growth geographic regions  such as europe 
why focus exclusively on servicing sophisticated global investors this client segment is extraordinarily attractive in terms of its size and rapid growth 
sophisticated global investors have a broad array of complex and specialized servicing requirements 
our clients needs include investment servicing  such as custody  fund accounting  transfer agency services and settlement investment management strategies and advisory services  including portfolio construction  research  and analytics and a range of trading services  from multi asset class trade execution to securities lending 
a key differentiator for us is our ability to integrate or customize solutions to fit each client s specific requirements 
an important source of growth for state street is an increasing preference on the part of sophisticated global investors to outsource their servicing requirements to an outside expert  rather than trying to handle it themselves 
global capital markets are becoming more complex with changes in investment regulations  advances in technology  and the development of global standards 
this transition is creating a shift away from relatively fragmented local and regional financial markets toward a more consolidated  globally integrated market 
the servicing implications of this change are tremendous 
never have sophisticated investors had more of a need for a trusted partner with global capabilities 
from state street s perspective  how is the financial services marketplace changing we see three broad trends that will have a significant effect on our business 
the first is a growing sense of urgency about retirement security 
longer life expectancies and the aging of the post world war ii generation will put tremendous pressure on retirement systems worldwide 
many developed nations are considering tax advantaged ways to strengthen their existing pension systems and encourage retirement savings 
these reforms will create growing pools of assets that need to be managed and serviced 
the second trend involves changes in savings and investment preferences 
the prolonged decline in equity markets has forced investment managers to look at new ways to increase their revenues while controlling risk 
this trend has resulted in many product innovations including exchange traded funds and wrap accounts that respond to investors increased sensitivity to costs 
demand has also increased for risk controlled strategies  including enhanced indexing  and non traditional investments such as hedge funds 
our expertise in risk controlled strategies and servicing for alternative investment products offers us an outstanding opportunity to support our clients as they expand their offerings in these areas 
the third trend is convergence in financial services 
in recent years  many companies have merged with or acquired other companies whose skills and reach complement their own 
these consolidations usually result in investment servicing operations in multiple countries  creating a level of complexity that is very difficult to administer 
many choose to outsource all or part of their servicing to a trusted provider like state street 
our full range of integrated solutions and our extensive global experience give us an advantage in competing for their business 
state street corporation where are the best opportunities for state street s future growth we grow our business in two ways by winning new clients and by selling more services to our existing clients 
in  we won a great deal of new business  including relationships with nuveen investments  a us based asset manager  and unico asset management sa  a luxembourg based asset management company 
we expect this momentum with regard to new business to continue 
however  we believe enriching our relationships with existing clients by expanding the range of products and services we offer them is an even greater opportunity 
even when the market declines  we can grow by constantly innovating looking for new ways to bring our clients the products and services they need 
several areas hold particular promise 
trading services  particularly equity execution  offer strong growth potential 
state street s position as the leader in global investor servicing gives us unparalleled scale and volume  as well as rich resources in research and analytics 
we deliver a full range of pre trade services  as well as multi asset class trade executions and post trade functions 
these services can be integrated for our clients on our state of the art trading platform  global link 
our capabilities allow us to assist global asset managers in all phases of the investment decision making process 
forming strategic outsourcing partnerships with asset managers is another area that continues to offer opportunities for growth 
we have the depth and breadth to provide asset managers with virtually any service they need 
and we can customize our offerings to focus on servicing a single area in depth a bundled series of functions or the whole gamut of services that are necessary to run the investment operations side of our clients business 
our wide reaching experience means we can run operations functions more efficiently and  most often  more cost effectively than the asset managers could themselves 
in  j 
w 
seligman co  a new york based investment manager  selected us as their outsourcing operations partner 
we had formerly provided seligman with fund accounting  fund administration  and custody services 
now we also handle trade support and settlement  portfolio record keeping  custodian communications for settlements  and systems network and applications support 
through this type of arrangement  partners like seligman gain access to state street s enterprise technologies  fully integrated solutions  and servicing efficiencies 
in addition  they benefit from greater cost control and the ability to focus on their core competency of money management 
we are also strategically expanding the scope of our integrated suite of services by focusing on growing markets 
in  we expanded our range of services for investment managers who serve the high net worth market 
this market totals about billion in assets  with strong growth projected for the coming years 
state street s full range of services  from managed account servicing to account aggregation  allows wealth managers to expand their service offerings to high net worth clients  while also freeing them to focus on relationship development and money management 
with our recent acquisition of international fund services  we also introduced a full line of services for alternative investments such as hedge funds 
hedge funds currently have about billion in assets under management with double digit growth projected for the coming years 
in these challenging times  we believe our risk controlled investment strategies  particularly enhanced indexing  also offer outstanding opportunities for growth 
how will the acquisition of deutsche bank s global securities services fit in with state street s strategy the acquisition of a substantial part of deutche bank s global securities services business supports our strategy to expand state street s scope and scale as the premier partner serving the needs of sophisticated global investors  particularly in the growing european market 
no other company will be able to match the range and quality of services we can offer globally 
in europe  where collective investments and pensions are growing at faster rates than in the united states  state street is now a big  local player  with more than double the amount of assets we service 
we believe the acquisition also offers a unique opportunity to generate long term value for our clients  stockholders  and employees 
state street corporation state street has acquired most of deutsche bank s global securities services business  including the bank s global custody  fund administration services  depotbank services  securities lending  performance measurement and benefit payment businesses worldwide  as well as domestic custody and securities clearing in the united states and the united kingdom 
our ten year contract to provide additional services to deutsche asset management  the largest asset manager in continental europe  also provides a significant revenue stream for state street 
these are all businesses we know well  which gives us confidence that the integration will proceed smoothly  yielding potentially significant benefits in terms of cost savings  economies of scale  expanded product capabilities  and cross selling opportunities 
what differentiates state street from its competitors state street has a competitive advantage in servicing the specialized needs of large  sophisticated global investors 
none of our competitors has the ability to integrate products and services the way we do or the experience in doing it globally 
no one else can match our scope and scale 
our size and industry commitment mean we can maintain the necessary investment in people  technology  and operations to grow and compete 
our goal  however  is not to be the biggest financial services provider  but the best 
we believe our success depends largely on our deep commitment and long standing relationships with our clients 
our client focus helps us operate as a trusted partner  seamlessly integrating people and systems while also developing new products and strategies to help our clients build their businesses 
our modular offerings allow us to tailor outsourcing solutions to each client s unique requirements 
our clients tell us that because we focus exclusively on serving their specialized needs we understand their business requirements and challenges better than any of our competitors 
we believe state street is uniquely positioned with the breadth of services  global experience  technology  and vision to help our clients succeed in all market conditions

d e r i v a t i v e f i n a n c i a l i n s t r u m e n t s state street adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  on january  in accordance with sfas no 
 state street records derivative instruments at fair value in the consolidated statement of condition 
the change in fair value of the corporation s derivative instruments is recorded currently in earnings  except for certain interest rate swap agreements that are accounted for as cash flow or fair value hedges 
the corporation has determined that the interest rate swaps accounted for as cash flow constitute a fully effective hedge  and as such  changes in fair value of these agreements  net of tax  are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
for interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges  the change in fair value of the derivative instrument  as well as the hedged item  are reported in earnings in the current period in processing fees and other revenue 
prior to adoption of sfas no 
 state street used three methods to account for derivative financial instruments the accrual method  deferral method and fair value method 
interest rate swaps that were entered into as part of interest rate management were accounted for using the accrual method 
interest receivable or payable payments under the terms of the interest rate swap were accrued over the period to which the payment related 
the interest payments accrued and any fees paid at inception were recorded as an adjustment to the interest revenue or interest expense of the underlying asset or liability 
other interest rate contracts that were used for balance sheet management were accounted for under the deferral method 
the basis of the contract was capitalized and any gain or loss was deferred and amortized over the life of the hedged asset or liability as an adjustment to the interest revenue or interest expense 
the gross amount of unrealized gains and losses on foreign exchange and interest rate contracts were reported separately at fair value on the balance sheet as other assets and other liabilities  respectively  in the consolidated statement of condition  except where such gains and losses arose from contracts covered by qualifying master netting agreements 
changes in fair value of these contracts were recorded in earnings 
i n c o m e t a x e s the corporation uses an asset and liability approach to account for income taxes 
the objective is to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year  and to recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary differences between the amounts reported in the financial statements and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
the measurement of tax assets and liabilities is based on enacted tax laws and applicable tax rates 
e a r n i n g s p e r s h a r e basic earnings per share excludes all dilution and is computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period 
diluted earnings per share includes all dilution from convertible debt  stock options and stock awards 
diluted earnings per share includes the assumption that all convertible debt has been converted as of the beginning of each period 
s t o c k s p l i t earnings per share  dividends per share and average shares outstanding have been restated for periods prior to the stock split distributed on may   to stockholders of record on april  the par value of additional shares was capitalized by a transfer from retained earnings to common stock 
state street corporation i m p a c t o f o t h e r r e c e n t a c c o u n t i n g a n n o u n c e m e n t s in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including guarantees of indebtedness of others 
disclosures related to this interpretation are effective for annual reports  and the accounting requirements are effective january   and require all guarantees and indemnifications within its scope to be recorded at fair value as liabilities  and the maximum possible loss to the corporation under these guarantees and indemnifications to be disclosed 
state street has indemnifications made to securities lending clients  certain investment guarantee products  credit enhancements and liquidity facilities  and parent company guarantees of subsidiary s obligations that fall within the scope of this interpretation 
each of these guarantees  except the parent company guarantees  are collateralized to some extent  which reduces loss exposure to the corporation 
the liabilities associated with these products upon adoption are not expected to be material to the corporation 
on december   the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
requires certain disclosures related to stock based compensation plans of the corporation 
at december   state street had three stock based employee compensation plans  which are described in note the corporation has applied the recognition and measurement provisions of apb and related interpretations in accounting for those plans 
no stock based employee compensation expense is reflected in net income in  or  as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
effective january   the corporation adopted  prospectively  the fair value recognition provisions of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  to all new awards granted to employees after january  awards under the corporation s plans vest over periods ranging from two to five years 
therefore  the expense related to stock based employee compensation included in the determination of net income for will be less than that which would have been recognized if the fair value method had been applied to all awards since the original effective date of sfas the following table illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the fair value method had been applied to all outstanding and unvested awards in each period 
dollars in millions  except per share data years ended december  net income  as reported  add stock based employee compensation expense included in reported net income  net of related tax effects deduct total stock based employee compensation expense determined under fair value method for all awards  net of related tax effects pro forma net income earnings per share basic as reported basic pro forma diluted as reported diluted pro forma on january   the fasb issued fasb interpretation no

state street corporation note regulatory matters r e g u l a t o r y c a p i t a l state street is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on state street s financial condition 
under capital adequacy guidelines  state street must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of state street s assets  liabilities and off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
state street s capital amounts and classification are subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings and other factors 
quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require state street and state street bank to maintain minimum risk based capital and leverage ratios as set forth in the table that follows 
the risk based capital ratios are tier capital and total capital to total adjusted risk weighted assets and market risk equivalents  and the tier leverage ratio is tier capital to quarterly average adjusted assets 
as of december   state street bank was categorized as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
to be categorized as well capitalized  state street bank must exceed the well capitalized guideline ratios  as set forth in the table  and meet certain other requirements 
state street bank exceeds all well capitalized requirements as of december  the regulatory capital amounts and ratios were the following at december regulatory guidelines state street state street bank well dollars in millions minimum capitalized r i s k b a s e d r a t i o s tier capital total capital tier leverage ratio tier capital     total capital     a d j u s t e d r i s k w e i g h t e d a s s e t s a n d m a r k e t r i s k e q u i v a l e n t s on balance sheet     off balance sheet     market risk equivalents total     quarterly average adjusted assets    state street must meet the regulatory designation of well capitalized in order to maintain its status as a financial holding company

federal and state banking regulations place certain restrictions on dividends paid by subsidiary banks to state street 
at december   state street bank had billion of retained earnings available for distribution to state street in the form of dividends 
the federal reserve act requires that extensions of credit by state street bank to certain affiliates  including state street  be secured by specific collateral  that the extension of credit to any one affiliate be limited to of capital and surplus as defined  and that extensions of credit to all such affiliates be limited to of capital and surplus

note lines of business state street reports two lines of business investment servicing and investment management 
given the nature of state street s services and management organization  the results of operations for these lines of business are not necessarily comparable with those of other companies 
revenue and expenses are directly charged or allocated to the lines of business through algorithm based management information systems 
state street prices its products and services on total client relationships and other factors  therefore  revenue may not necessarily reflect market pricing on products within the business lines in the same way as it would for independent business entities 
assets and liabilities are allocated according to rules that support management s strategic and tactical goals 
capital is allocated based on risk weighted assets employed and management s judgment 
the capital allocations may not be representative of the capital that might be required if these lines of business were independent business entities 
investment servicing includes custody  accounting  daily pricing and administration  master trust and master custody  trustee and recordkeeping  foreign exchange  securities lending  deposit and short term investment facilities  lease financing  investment manager operations outsourcing  and performance  risk and compliance analytics to support institutional investors

state street corporation note off balance sheet financial instruments  including derivatives d e r i v a t i v e f i n a n c i a l i n s t r u m e n t s state street uses derivatives to support clients needs  conduct trading activities  and manage its interest rate and currency risk 
the corporation assumes positions in both the foreign exchange and interest rate markets by buying and selling cash instruments and using financial derivatives  including foreign exchange forward contracts  foreign exchange and interest rate options  and interest rate swaps 
an off balance sheet derivative instrument is a financial instrument or other contract which has one or more underlying and one or more notional amounts  no initial net investment  or a smaller initial net investment than would be expected for similar types of contracts  and which requires or permits net settlement 
derivative instruments include forwards  futures  swaps  options and other instruments with similar characteristics 
the use of these instruments generates fee or interest revenue 
interest rate contracts involve an agreement with a counterparty to exchange cash flows based on the movement of an underlying interest rate index 
an interest rate swap agreement involves the exchange of a series of interest payments  either at a fixed or variable rate  based upon the notional amount without the exchange of the underlying principal amount 
an interest rate option contract provides the purchaser  for a premium  the right  but not the obligation  to buy or sell the underlying financial instrument at a set price at or during a specified period 
an interest rate futures contract is a commitment to buy or sell  at a future date  a financial instrument at a contracted price  it may be settled in cash or through the delivery of the contracted instrument 
foreign exchange contracts involve an agreement to exchange one currency for another currency at an agreed upon rate and settlement date 
foreign exchange contracts consist of swap agreements and forward and spot contracts 
the following table summarizes the contractual or notional amounts of derivative financial instruments held or issued for trading and balance sheet management at december dollars in millions t r a d i n g interest rate contracts swap agreements   options and caps purchased options and caps written futures short position   options on futures purchased options on futures written foreign exchange contracts forward  swap and spot   options purchased  options written  futures b a l a n c e s h e e t m a n a g e m e n t interest rate contracts swap agreements   state street corporation in connection with its interest rate risk management strategies  state street has executed interest rate swap agreements with a notional value of billion and billion at december  and  respectively  designated as fair value hedges to hedge the changes in the fair value of certain securities 
for the years ended december  and  state street recognized net pre tax losses of approximately million and million  respectively  which represented the ineffective portion of the hedge reported in processing fees and other revenue 
state street has designated interest rate swaps with a notional value of million as cash flow hedges to its floating rate debt 
these interest rate swaps constitute a fully effective hedge 
in addition  state street entered into interest rate swaps with a notional value of million effective february   a notional value of million effective june   and a notional value of million effective july   designated as fair value hedges to hedge certain of its fixed rate debt issuances 
the fair value hedge swaps increased the value of long term debt presented in the statement of condition by million 
for the year ended december   the corporation s overall weighted average interest rate for long term debt was on a contractual basis and including the effects of derivative contracts 
f a i r v a l u e o f d e r i v a t i v e f i n a n c i a l i n s t r u m e n t s state street s risk exposure from interest rate and foreign exchange contracts results from the possibility that one party may default on its contractual obligation or from movements in exchange or interest rates 
credit risk is limited to the positive market value of the derivative financial instrument  which is significantly less than the notional value 
the notional value provides the basis for determining the exchange of contractual cash flows 
the exposure to credit loss can be estimated by calculating the cost  on a present value basis  to replace at current market rates all profitable contracts at year end 
the estimated aggregate replacement cost of derivative financial instruments in a net positive position was billion at december   and billion at december the foreign exchange contracts have been reduced by offsetting balances with the same counterparty where a master netting agreement exists

for other financial instrument contracts  there were losses of million in  million in and million in future cash requirements  if any  related to foreign currency contracts are represented by the gross amount of currencies to be exchanged under each contract unless state street and the counterparty have agreed to pay or receive the net contractual settlement amount on the settlement date 
future cash requirements on other financial instruments are limited to the net amounts payable under the agreements 
state street corporation c r e d i t r e l a t e d  o f f b a l a n c e s h e e t f i n a n c i a l i n s t r u m e n t s credit related financial instruments include indemnified securities on loan  commitments to extend credit or purchase assets  standby letters of credit  and letters of credit 
the maximum credit risk associated with credit related financial instruments is measured by the contractual amounts of these instruments 
the following is a summary of the contractual amount of credit related  off balance sheet financial instruments at december dollars in millions indemnified securities on loan   liquidity asset purchase agreements   loan commitments   standby letters of credit   letters of credit on behalf of its clients  state street lends their securities to creditworthy brokers and other institutions 
in certain circumstances  state street may indemnify its clients for the fair market value of those securities against a failure of the borrower to return such securities 
collateral funds resulting from state street s securities lending services are held by state street as agent  therefore  under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  these assets are not assets of the corporation 
state street requires the borrowers to provide collateral in an amount equal to or in excess of of the fair market value of the securities borrowed 
the borrowed securities are revalued daily to determine if additional collateral is necessary 
state street held  as collateral  cash and us government securities totaling billion and billion for indemnified securities on loan at december  and  respectively 
loan commitments unfunded loans and unused lines of credit  asset purchase agreements  standby letters of credit and letters of credit are issued to accommodate the financing needs of state street s clients and to provide credit enhancements to variable interest entities 
loan commitments are agreements by state street to lend monies at a future date 
asset purchase agreements are commitments to purchase receivables or securities  subject to conditions established in the agreements 
these loan  asset purchase and letter of credit commitments are subject to the same credit policies and reviews as loans 
the amount and nature of collateral are obtained based upon management s assessment of the credit risk 
approximately of the loan commitments and asset purchase agreements expire within one year from the date of issue 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire or renew without being drawn  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
state street provides liquidity and credit enhancements facilities in the forms of liquidity asset purchase agreements  lines of credit  and standby letters of credit to two types of variable interest entities vies 
one type  which state street administers  issues asset backed commercial paper abcp 
at december  and  state street s commitments under liquidity asset purchase agreements and lines of credit to these vies were billion and billion  respectively  and standby letters of credit were million and million  respectively  none of which were utilized 
amounts committed  but unused  under the liquidity asset purchase agreements  lines of credit and standby letters of credit that state street provides to these vies are included in the table above 
asset performance deterioration may cause the asset risk to shift from the abcp investors to state street as the liquidity provider for the asset as the vie may need to repay maturing commercial paper by drawing the liquidity facilities 
for a second type of vie  structured as a qualified special purpose entity in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  state street distributes and sells equity interests in tax exempt investment grade assets that are primarily sold to mutual fund clients 
state street provides liquidity asset purchase agreements to these entities 
these liquidity asset purchase agreements obligate state street to buy state street corporation the equity interests in the underlying portfolio at par  which approximates market value  in the event that the re marketing agent is unable to place the equity interests of the vie with investors 
the liquidity asset purchase agreements are subject to early termination by state street in the event of payment default  bankruptcy of issuer or credit enhancement provider  taxability  or downgrade of an asset below investment grade 
state street s liquidity asset purchase agreements to these vies were billion and billion at december  and  respectively  none of which were utilized  and are included in the preceding table 
note fair value of financial instruments state street uses the following methods to estimate the fair value of financial instruments 
for financial instruments that have quoted market prices  those quotes are used to determine fair value 
financial instruments that have no defined maturity  have a remaining maturity of days or less  or reprice frequently to a market rate are assumed to have a fair value that approximates reported book value  after taking into consideration any applicable credit risk 
if no market quotes are available  financial instruments are valued by discounting the expected cash flow s using an estimated current market interest rate for the financial instrument 
for off balance sheet derivative instruments  fair value is estimated as the amount at which an asset or liability could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties  other than in a forced or liquidation sale 
the short maturity of state street s assets and liabilities results in a significant number of financial instruments whose fair value equals or closely approximates reported balance sheet value 
such financial instruments are reported in the following balance sheet captions cash and due from banks  interest bearing deposits with banks  securities purchased under resale agreements and securities borrowed  federal funds sold  deposits  securities sold under repurchase agreements  federal funds purchased and other short term borrowings 
the fair value of trading account assets equals the carrying value 
as of december  and  the net fair value of interest rate contracts used for balance sheet management was a liability of million and a liability of million  respectively 
there is no reported cost for loan commitments since terms are at prevailing market rates 
the reported value and fair value for other balance sheet captions at december are as follows reported fair dollars in millions value value investment securities available for sale   held to maturity   net loans excluding leases   long term debt   investment securities available for sale   held to maturity   net loans excluding leases   long term debt   state street corporation note non us activities non us activities  as defined by the securities and exchange commission  are considered to be those revenue producing assets and transactions that arise from clients domiciled outside the united states 
due to the nature of state street s business  it is not possible to segregate precisely us and us activities 
subjective judgments have been used to arrive at the operating results for non us activities  including the application of tax transfer pricing and asset liability management policies 
interest expense allocations are based on the average cost of short term borrowed funds 
state street does not allocate costs related to resources common to non us and non us activities 
certain previously reported amounts have been restated to conform to the current method of presentation
