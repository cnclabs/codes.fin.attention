item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and the results of operations should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
for this purpose  statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward looking statements 
without limiting the foregoing  the words believes  anticipates  plans  expects and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties and are not guarantees of future performance 
actual results may differ materially from those indicated in such forward looking statements as a result of certain factors including  but not limited to  those set forth under the heading factors affecting future operating results 
overview since our inception  we have incurred significant operating losses and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
the majority of our operating losses have resulted from costs we incurred developing our hap tm technology  in our clinical trials and administrative costs associated with operations 
we expect to dedicate a significant portion of our resources for the foreseeable future to service our hap tm partnership program and strength program partners  our pharmacogenomics support services customers  our caring program and to maintain our hap tm technology 
to date  our revenue has been primarily from licensing and service fees from our agreements with astrazeneca uk limited  biogen  inc  gene logic  inc  j j prd and pfizer  inc  as well as a sublicensing agreement with visible genetics  inc 
and  to a lesser extent  government grants 
in august  we announced a restructuring and cost reduction program to revise our business focus and to better align our operating cost structure with our current and projected partner needs and projected revenues from our current and projected partners 
the cost reduction program included a realignment of management responsibilities  a reduction in our workforce and a decision to seek partners for all internal product development programs 
the workforce was reduced by percent to employees in the third fiscal quarter  with the majority of the workforce reductions occurring in the dna sequencing facility and related informatics support 
we incurred a charge for severance and related costs of approximately  which was recorded in operating results in the third fiscal quarter of all severance obligations associated with this workforce reduction had been paid by december  as a result of the restructuring and cost reduction program  we expect future operating expenses to decrease from prior levels  primarily in research and development expenses 
in addition to reducing expenses  our plans and projections reflect a measurable reduction in our negative operating cash flow 
these planned reductions in our negative operating cash flow assume significant year over year increases in revenues 
there can be no assurance that revenues will continue to increase or that there will continue to be a decrease in the level of cash used to fund operations 
if we are not successful in increasing revenues or reducing expenses  as planned  we may not be able to maintain our operations at planned levels 
during the second quarter of  we recorded a million charge for the impairment of fixed assets 
this charge relates to sequencing equipment  computer hardware and software and leasehold improvements in our dna sequencing facility that we determined needed to be reviewed for potential impairment 
as a result of our review  we determined that the carrying value of the assets was in excess of discounted future cash flows to be generated by the asset group and we recorded a write down of million 
we continue to review our fixed assets for potential impairment and  based upon our current cash flow projections  have determined that there has not been an additional impairment of our fixed assets 
in november  we announced that we had amended our collaboration agreement with a customer which accounted for of our revenue for the year ended december  the amendment clarifies the intellectual property rights granted pursuant to the agreement 
this agreement expires in the fourth quarter of unless an extension is negotiated 
a collaboration agreement with a customer that accounted for of our revenue for the year ended december   expired in the fourth quarter of in december  we announced that we received a notice from general electric capital corporation ge  claiming that an event of default had occurred under our lease agreement as a result of an alleged material adverse change in our business 
we also received a notice from finova capital corporation finova  stating that as a result of the default claim by ge  there was a cross default under our agreement with finova 
both lessors declared that all principal and future interest obligations were immediately due and payable 
in march  we settled the claim with ge and simultaneously amended our lease agreement ge amendment 
in connection with the ge amendment  and as additional security for our payment obligations to ge  we delivered to ge a million irrevocable letter of credit and agreed to additional covenants 
it is expected that the letter of credit will be adjusted on a quarterly basis commencing october  based on a decrease in outstanding amounts due to ge  as defined 
in connection with the amendment  ge retroactively rescinded their default claim 
the ge amendment and letter of credit has been retroactively reflected in the accompanying financial statements 
we have not entered into a settlement agreement with finova 
accordingly  we have recorded an additional charge to interest expense to reflect the remaining interest and principal currently due and payable under the finova capital lease agreement 
we enter into discussions from time to time regarding the acquisition of or strategic investment in other businesses or technologies 
we are currently in negotiations with respect to the acquisition of all or substantially all of the assets of a company with technologies we believe are complementary to ours 
we cannot assure you if we will be successful in these negotiations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying footnotes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from estimates under different conditions  sometimes materially 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require management s most subjective judgments 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition valuation of long lived assets research and development expenses revenue recognition 
we recognize license and service revenue from our agreements with third parties 
the revenue includes fees we receive for the license of our hap tm database and proprietary software  milestone payments based on the achievement of certain goals and services fees for providing specific data on genetic variation 
upfront  non refundable fees received in connection with a collaboration agreement are deferred and amortized into revenue over the term of the agreement 
license revenues are recognized ratably over the access period of the agreement 
revenue derived from the achievement of a milestone is recognized when the milestone is achieved  provided that the milestone is substantive and a culmination of the earnings process has occurred 
service fees are recorded as the services are performed 
revenues derived from the achievement of milestones or recognition of related work when performed under the terms of a contract  as well as the access period of the license agreement  may cause our operating results to vary considerably from period to period 
valuation of long lived assets 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
factors which could trigger an impairment review  include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which a long lived asset is being used  a significant adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of a long lived asset  and a significant decrease in the market value of assets 
when determining whether the carrying value of the long lived assets is recoverable we make certain estimates and assumptions regarding the undiscounted cash flows and discounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets 
we determine the discounted future cash flow using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business 
a change in our estimates or the manner in which we use the asset may cause results to vary from period to period 
research and development expenses 
we record research and development expenses when they are incurred or  in the case of clinical trial expenses  based upon information we receive from third party cros 
research and development expenses include the following major types of costs salaries and benefits  material and reagent costs  research license fees  clinical trial expenses  depreciation and amortization of lab equipment and leasehold improvements and building and utility costs related to research space 
vendor contractual costs consist primarily of consulting arrangements and certain clinical trial expenses 
we expense clinical trial costs as incurred based on information we receive from third parties and estimates that we make 
our estimates may change as additional information becomes available which could cause results to vary from period to period 
results of operations years ended december  and revenue consists primarily of proceeds received in connection with the licensing of our hap tm technology  service revenue and sublicensing of patents 
revenue increased to million in from million in the increase in license revenues is attributable to the commercialization of our hap tm technology  including agreements entered into with biogen during  astrazeneca during and j j prd during revenue from gene logic  inc  j j prd and pfizer  inc accounted for and of our total revenue in fiscal and  respectively 
revenue from each of these customers accounted for or more of our total revenue for and  respectively 
revenue for fiscal includes a payment received from j j prd in the fourth quarter for achieving a milestone 
we are recognizing the annual license and subscription fees over the term of the agreements and the service fees as the services are performed 
future milestone and royalty payments  when and if received  will be recognized when earned 
revenue also includes the amortization  over the remaining life of the sublicensed patent  of upfront payments received in connection with the sublicensing of a patent 
research and development expenses consist primarily of payroll and benefits for research and development personnel  materials and reagent costs  costs incurred in connection with clinical trials  depreciation and maintenance costs for equipment used for hap tm marker discovery and hap tm typing  and facility related costs 
we expense our research and development costs as incurred 
research and development costs decreased to million in from million in the decrease in research and development expenses in is primarily attributable to a decrease of approximately million in expenditures related to our clinical trials  a decrease of approximately million in material and reagent costs associated with the discovery of new hap tm markers  a decrease of approximately million in payroll and related costs and a decrease of approximately million in technology license fees 
the decrease in clinical trial expenses is primarily due to our strength trials  which were substantially completed by december  the decrease in material and reagent costs is primarily due to a reduction in dna sequencing consistent with the removal of the majority of our abi prism registered trademark dna analyzers from production in the quarter ended june  the decrease in payroll and related costs is primarily due to our work force reduction in connection with our restructuring program 
we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to research and development expenses in the near future as we continue to service our hap tm partnership program and strength program partners  our pharmacogenomic support services customers  our caring program and to maintain our hap tm technology 
we expect research and development expenses to decrease modestly in as a result of the restructuring program that we initiated in august general and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and benefits for executive  business development  finance  public affairs and other administrative personnel  as well as facility related costs and outside professional fees incurred in connection with corporate development  general legal and financial matters 
general and administrative expenses decreased to approximately million in from million in the decrease in general and administrative expenses in is primarily due to a million decrease in consulting and professional service fees and a general reduction in expenses as part of our cost reduction program initiated during the million impairment of fixed assets charge relates to sequencing equipment  computer hardware and software and leasehold improvements in our dna sequencing facility 
during the quarter ended june   our management determined that certain conditions had arisen during the quarter that triggered the need for a review of our long lived assets for potential impairment 
these conditions included  but were not limited to  the overall business climate in which we operate and a significant change in the manner in which we were utilizing our dna sequencing facility and related assets 
in particular  during the quarter ended june   we determined that our sequencing production capacity significantly exceeded our forecasted demand for the foreseeable future  which resulted in our decision to remove from production the majority of our abi prism registered trademark dna analyzers  the primary assets of the group 
accordingly  we performed an impairment review on our sequencing long lived assets 
as a result of our review  we determined that the carrying value of the assets was in excess of the projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset group 
to determine the amount of the impairment charge  we compared the carrying value of the applicable fixed assets to their fair value 
we determined the fair value of the fixed assets by discounting expected future cash flows using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business 
as a result of our analysis  we determined that the carrying value of the assets was in excess of discounted future cash flows to be generated by the asset group and we recorded a write down of million 
the impairment charge has been allocated to the individual assets on a pro rata basis 
the revised carrying value of the assets is being depreciated over the average remaining life of the primary assets of the group 
interest income decreased to approximately million in from million in the decrease is the result of higher cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances in and the much lower interest rates on investments during interest expense increased to approximately million in from million in the increase is primarily due to recording additional interest expense during the quarter ended december   in connection with certain events of default 
in december  we received a notice from ge claiming that an event of default had occurred under our lease agreement as a result of an alleged material adverse change in our business 
because of the alleged default  ge declared that all principal and future interest obligations were immediately due and payable 
ge also filed a complaint in the superior court of the state of connecticut  demanding payment of all amounts due under the lease agreement 
we also received a notice from finova  stating that as a result of the default claim by ge  there had been a cross default under our agreement with finova 
finova declared that all principal and future interest obligations were immediately due and payable 
in march  we settled the claim with ge and simultaneously amended our lease agreement ge amendment 
in connection with the amendment  ge retroactively rescinded their default claim and both parties have withdrawn from any legal action 
as we have not entered into a settlement agreement with finova  we have recorded an additional charge to interest expense to reflect the fact that all future interest and principal is currently due and payable under the finova capital lease agreement 
if  in the future  we enter into a settlement or amend our agreement with finova it may result in the reversal  in the period of amendment or settlement  of the remaining interest expense recognized in the fourth quarter 
the status of the capital lease obligations is discussed further in liquidity and capital resources 
state income tax expense benefit decreased to an expense of  in from a benefit of million in the benefit represents a net tax benefit from the state of connecticut as a result of legislation which allowed companies to receive cash refunds from the state at a rate of of their incremental research and development tax credit  as defined  in exchange for foregoing the carryforward of the research and development tax credit 
the state of connecticut rescinded the legislation in years ended december  and revenue consists primarily of proceeds received in connection with the licensing of our hap tm technology  service revenue and sublicensing of patents 
revenue increased to million in from  in the increase in license revenues is attributable to the commercialization of our hap tm technology  including an agreement entered into with pfizer during  as well as agreements entered into with j j prd and gene logic  inc during revenue from each of j j prd  gene logic  inc and pfizer  inc 
accounted for or more of our total revenue in fiscal j j prd  gene logic  inc and visible genetics  inc each accounted for or more of our total revenue in we are recognizing the annual license and subscription fees over the term of the agreements and the service fees as the services are performed 
future milestone and royalty payments  when and if received  will be recognized when earned 
revenue also includes the amortization  over the remaining life of the sublicensed patent  of upfront payments received in connection with the sublicensing of a patent 
research and development expenses consist primarily of payroll and benefits for research and development personnel  materials and reagent costs  costs incurred in connection with clinical trials  depreciation and maintenance costs for equipment used for hap tm marker discovery and hap tm typing  and facility related costs 
research and development costs increased to million in from million in research and development expenses include stock based and other non cash compensation charges of  and million for and  respectively  for options granted to employees  scientific advisory board members and consultants 
the overall increase in research and development expenses in is primarily attributable to an increase in expenditures related to our clinical trials  the expansion of our hap tm typing process  and the increase in resources dedicated to supporting and improving our proprietary decogen registered trademark informatics system 
the increase in expenses includes a million increase in costs related to our clinical trials  a million increase in payroll and related costs  a million increase in technology licenses and a million increase in depreciation expense 
the decrease in stock based compensation is primarily due to our decision to vest fully all unvested options previously granted to scientific advisory board members in march  which resulted in a one time expense of approximately million 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salary and related costs for executive  business development  finance  public affairs and other administrative personnel  as well as facility related costs and outside professional fees incurred in connection with corporate development  general legal and financial matters 
general and administrative expenses increased to approximately million in from million in general and administrative expenses include stock based and other non cash compensation charges of  and million for and  respectively for options granted to employees  directors and consultants 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in is primarily due to increased salary and related costs as a result of the expansion of our business development activities and the additional costs of operating as a public company for a full fiscal year 
the increase in general and administrative expenses is partially offset by a decrease in stock based compensation due to the recording of approximately million of expense during which related to a stock purchase agreement between two officers and a former executive officer which we recognized as compensatory and accordingly recognized non cash compensation based on the increase in the fair value of the stock through the date of our initial public offering 
sublicensing royalty expense represents royalty obligations incurred by us on sublicensing fees that we receive 
sublicensing royalty expense decreased to  in from  in this decrease relates primarily to a nonrefundable cash payment received in in connection with an amendment to a patent sublicensing agreement 
we elected to recognize this expense in as paid 
interest income expense  net decreased to approximately million in from million in the decrease is the result of higher cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances in as a result of proceeds received from our sale of series b and series c preferred stock in february and march  respectively  and our initial public offering in august the decrease is also the result of an increase in interest expense as a result of higher capital lease and other debt obligations to fund the acquisition of equipment and partially fund the expansion of our facilities 
state income tax benefit of million represents a net tax benefit from the state of connecticut as a result of recent legislation which allows companies to receive cash refunds from the state at a rate of of their incremental research and development tax credit  as defined  in exchange for foregoing the carryforward of the research and development tax credit 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations primarily through the private and public sale of common and preferred stock  government research grants  payments under licensing agreements  loans and capital leases 
from inception through december   we have received aggregate gross proceeds of approximately million from issuance of common and preferred stock 
in addition  through december   we have received million of government grant funding and million from license and service fees  royalties and research contracts 
we also have received million from capital lease financing arrangements and million from other loans 
through december   we have acquired million of property and equipment 
these assets were largely financed through capital lease financing arrangements and other loans 
we expect to continue to finance our operations in the short term from cash we received in from the sale of our common and preferred stock and revenue from our hap tm partnership program partners and our pharmacogenomics support services customers 
our business strategy depends on  among other things  entering into partnership agreements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
if we are unsuccessful in marketing our partnership programs and pharmacogenomic support services  we may not generate sufficient revenues to sustain our operations at planned levels 
cash used in operations for the year ended december  was million compared with million for the same period in the cash used in operations for the year ended december  resulted primarily from a net loss of million and a million decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  partially offset by million of non cash charges for depreciation and amortization expense and impairment of fixed assets  a million increase in deferred revenue and a million decrease in other current assets including the receipt  in september  of million from the state of connecticut for the sale of research and development tax credits 
cash provided by investing activities was million in compared with million in in  we used cash to purchase  of property and equipment and received proceeds of million from the liquidation of investments in marketable securities and used cash to purchase million of marketable securities 
cash used in financing activities was million in compared to million in during  we repaid debt of approximately million and were required to provide cash collateral of million in connection with the letter of credit issued as part of the ge amendment 
our contractual cash obligations as of december   are as follows payments due by period in thousands fiscal years fiscal years fiscal year contractual obligations total fiscal and and and later long term debt  including interest     capital lease obligations   operating leases      minimum license obligations total contractual cash obligations      reflects all lease obligations as being current 
however  as a result of the march ge amendment  we anticipate paying the outstanding ge lease obligation under the original maturity schedule through february  long term debt consists primarily of three financing agreements with connecticut innovations  inc cii  a stockholder of the company  used to finance certain leasehold improvements and other costs associated with our facility expansion 
each agreement provides for interest only for a certain period with principal payments  based on a month amortization  beginning in april through october  and with final balloon payments due in march through june borrowings under the agreements bear interest at and are secured by the related leasehold improvements 
the company was in compliance with all debt covenants as of december  and no cross default provisions exist in the agreements 
capital lease obligations  related to equipment  consist principally of arrangements with four equipment leasing companies 
the leases have terms ranging from two to four years with installments originally scheduled to end between august and october and which bear interest at rates ranging from to 
the majority of the capital lease arrangements allow for the purchase of the related equipment at the completion of the lease term  as defined in the agreements  and certain of the agreements require the purchase of the equipment at the completion of the lease term 
in december  the company announced it received a notice from ge claiming that an event of default had occurred under the lease agreement as a result of an alleged material adverse change in the company s business 
because of the alleged default  ge declared that all principal and future interest obligations were due and payable immediately 
ge also filed a complaint in the superior court of the state of connecticut  demanding payment of all amounts due under the lease agreements 
the company also received a notice from finova  stating that as a result of the alleged default claim by ge  there was a cross default under the company s agreement with finova 
in connection with a cross default  finova declared that all principal and future interest obligations were due and payable immediately 
in march  the company and ge agreed to an amendment to their existing lease agreement 
in connection with this amendment  ge has rescinded and withdrawn its default claim and both parties have withdrawn from any legal action 
the lease amendment requires certain additional covenants as well as a million letter of credit  which is collateralized by cash 
because of the outstanding claim of default by finova  the company recorded an additional charge to interest expense during this charge represents all future interest payments due under the terms of the agreement with finova 
as of december   the company has classified as current the ge and finova lease obligations  as a result of continuing material adverse change provisions within the ge agreement and as a result of the finova default claim 
we lease our operating facilities located in new haven  connecticut 
the lease agreements require annual lease payments of  per year increasing to million per year over the original term which expires in we have two five year renewal options to extend the lease agreements beyond the initial term 
we are recording the expense associated with the lease on a straight line basis over the expected term of the lease 
in addition to the operating lease agreements for our current facility  we also have operating leases for various office equipment 
in addition  we periodically enter into agreements with third parties to obtain exclusive or non exclusive licenses for certain technologies 
the terms of certain of these agreements require us to pay future royalty payments and certain milestone payments based on product sales or sublicense income generated from applicable technologies  if any 
the amount of such payments will depend upon successful commercialization of applicable technologies  if any 
the future minimum payments assuming non termination of these leases are included in the minimum license obligations above 
capital expenditures are not expected to exceed  to million for each of fiscal and our cash requirements will vary depending upon a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control  including the demand for our hap tm technology  the efforts and success of our hap tm partnership program  the commercialization of intellectual property derived from our associations  the level of competition we face  our ability to maintain our hap tm technology  and our ability to manage effectively our operating expenses 
on december   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million  which includes million of restricted cash  compared to approximately million at december  our cash reserves are held in interest bearing  high grade corporate bonds and money market accounts 
we believe that our existing cash reserves will be sufficient to fund our expected net losses  debt obligations and capital expenditures for at least months 
to execute our business plan  we will need to grow our revenues significantly each year and we may need to seek additional funding through public or private equity offerings  debt financings or commercial partners 
we cannot assure you that we will obtain additional partners or capital funding on acceptable terms  if at all 
income taxes we have not generated any taxable income to date and  therefore  have not paid any federal income taxes since inception 
on december   we had available unused net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  which may be available to offset future federal and state taxable income  respectively 
use of our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards  which will begin to expire in and  respectively  may be subject to limitations 
the future utilization of these carryforwards may be limited due to changes within our current and future ownership structure as defined within the income tax code 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset  which consists primarily of net operating loss carryforwards  because of uncertainty regarding its recoverability  as required by statement of financial accounting standards no

factors affecting future operating results this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and are based on the beliefs and assumptions of our management based on information currently available to our management 
use of words  such as believes  expects  anticipates  intends  plans  estimates  should  likely or similar expressions  indicate a forward looking statement 
forward looking statements involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
certain of the information contained in this annual report on form k consists of forward looking statements 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements include the following we are an early stage company with a history of losses and we expect to incur net losses for the foreseeable future such that we may never be profitable 
we have incurred substantial operating losses since our inception 
as of december   we have generated only minimal revenue from our hap tm partnership program and our pharmacogenomics support services  and we do not expect to generate significant revenues for several years  if ever 
from inception through december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
our losses to date have resulted principally from costs we incurred in the development of our hap tm technology  in our clinical trials and from general and administrative costs associated with operations 
we expect to devote our resources to service our hap tm partnership program and strength program partners  our pharmacogenomics support services customers  our caring program and to maintain our hap tm technology 
we expect to incur additional losses this year and in future years  and we may never achieve profitability 
in addition  pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are only now beginning to use products such as ours in their drug and diagnostic development or marketing efforts and  accordingly  they may not choose to use our hap tm technology 
we do not expect our losses to be substantially mitigated by revenues from our hap tm partnership and strength programs and our caring program  if any  or from our pharmacogenomics support services for a number of years  if ever 
we currently rely on a limited number of licensing and service arrangements for substantially all of our revenues 
as a result  the loss of one major customer or our inability to secure additional significant customers during a given period would have an adverse affect on our business and operating results 
we are dependent upon a limited number of licensing and service arrangements that represent substantially all of our revenues 
in the year ended december   three of our customers accounted for of our total revenues 
the agreement with the first customer expired by its terms in the fourth quarter of the agreements with the second and third customers terminate by their terms in the third quarter of and the fourth quarter of  respectively 
if we are unable to replace  upon substantially similar terms  the agreement that expired in or if we lose either of the remaining significant customers  it would have a material adverse affect on our revenues and on our business in general and could cause volatility or a decline in our stock price 
to generate significant revenues  we must obtain additional customers for our hap tm partnership program and our strength and caring programs 
our strategy depends on entering into agreements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for our hap tm partnership program and our strength and caring programs 
we currently have a hap tm partnership program with six pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as well as an agreement with a major diagnostic company to commercialize exclusively the diagnostic rights and non exclusively the product development rights from our strength program 
we may not obtain additional partners for our hap tm partnership program and our strength program or obtain any partners for our caring program 
if we are unsuccessful in finding additional partners for our hap tm partnership program and our strength program or in finding any partners for our caring program  we may never generate sufficient revenues to sustain our operations 
in addition  we expect that some of our future hap tm partnership program collaborations  like some of our current hap tm partnership program collaborations  will be limited to specific  limited term projects or that some of these collaborations may not be renewed 
accordingly  we must continually obtain new customers to be successful 
to date  the integration of pharmacogenomics into drug development and marketing has not achieved widespread market acceptance 
if the estimates we make  and the assumptions on which we rely  in preparing our financial statements prove inaccurate  our actual results may vary from these reflected in our projections and accruals 
our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  the amounts of charges accrued by us and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
there can be no assurance  however  that our estimates or the assumptions underlying our estimates will be correct 
we may require additional funding to fund operations and repay debt and we may not be able to obtain any 
we have used substantial amounts of cash to fund our research and development activities 
we will continue to spend funds to service our hap tm partnership program and srength program partners  our pharmacogenomics support services customers  our caring program and to maintain our hap tm technology 
we plan to pay for these activities with funds from our existing cash and investment securities and income that we may receive from our hap tm partnership program and strength program partners and pharmacogenomics support services customers 
we intend to rely on our current hap tm partnership program and strength program partners and future partners  if any  and our current pharmacogenomics support services customers and future customers  if any  for significant funding in the future to support our development efforts 
to execute our business plans  we will need to grow our revenues significantly each year 
we cannot be certain when we will begin to receive additional income  if at all  from our hap tm partnership and strength programs and our pharmacogenomics support services and income  if any  from our caring program 
if we do not receive this income or do not receive it as rapidly as we expect  we would spend our existing cash and investment securities more rapidly than we currently plan 
we believe that our existing cash reserves will be sufficient to support our expected net losses  debt obligations and capital expenditures for at least months 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain new partners or to generate the increased revenues required to meet our business plan objectives 
in addition  to execute our business plans  we may need to seek additional funding through public or private equity offerings  debt financings or commercial partners 
we cannot assure you that we will obtain additional partners or capital funding on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to generate sufficient revenues or access capital on acceptable terms  we may be required to a obtain funds on unfavorable terms that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies or that would significantly dilute our stockholders and or b significantly scale back current operations 
either of these two possibilities would have a material adverse effect on our business 
our hap tm technology may not allow our partners to develop commercial products or to increase sales of their marketed products 
we developed our hap tm technology on the assumption that information about gene variation and gene variation associated with drug response may help drug development professionals better understand the drug response of particular populations and complex disease processes 
although the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are increasing their use of genomics in analyzing drug response and diseases  we are unaware of any successful drug development program applying population genomics 
we discover hap tm markers for pharmaceutically relevant genes 
if we are unable to find hap tm markers for pharmaceutically relevant genes in a timely manner  our potential partners may lose confidence in our hap tm technology and our company  and this loss in confidence could decrease our ability to generate revenues 
even if we are able to discover the hap tm markers for pharmaceutically relevant genes  this information may not prove to be superior to genomic variation information discovered by our competitors 
furthermore  pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies may not choose our hap tm technology over competing technologies 
our decogen registered trademark informatics system may also be less effective than we expect or may not allow our partners or us to determine a correlation between drug response and genomic variation 
furthermore  even if our partners or we are successful in identifying a specific correlation between drug response and genomic variation based on our hap tm technology  our partners may not be able to develop or sell commercially viable products nor may our partners be able to increase the sales of their marketed products using this correlation 
accordingly  our hap tm markers and hap tm technology may not improve the development  marketing and prescribing of drugs or the development and marketing of diagnostics developed by our hap tm partnership program and strength program partners 
if we are unable to obtain intellectual property protection for our hap tm technology  trade secrets or know how  we may not be able to operate our business profitably 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to protect our hap tm technology  any associations that we find between clinical outcomes and genetic variation and any other proprietary software  methods and technologies that we develop  either as a trade secret or under the patent and other intellectual property laws of the united states and other countries  so that we can prevent unauthorized entities from using our inventions and proprietary information 
because patent applications that were filed prior to november  in the united states are confidential until patents issue  third parties may have filed patent applications for technology covered by our pending patent applications without our being aware of those applications  and our patent applications may not have priority over any patent applications of others 
we are aware that there are other firms or individuals who have discovered  or are currently discovering  information similar to the information we are discovering  who may have filed  and in the future are likely to file  patent applications that are similar or identical to our patent applications 
our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  including ours  are generally uncertain as a result of the uncertain state of the patent law in the biotechnology field 
there is no uniform  worldwide policy regarding the subject matter and scope of claims granted or allowable in biotechnology patents  particularly those involving genomics 
in addition  some interest groups are lobbying for restrictions on patenting of genetic tests 
if we cannot establish additional collaborative relationships  we may be unable to develop or commercialize our hap tm technology and we will depend on our partners to develop or to co develop products 
we currently have a hap tm partnership program with six pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies as well as an agreement with a major diagnostic company to commercialize exclusively the diagnostic rights and non exclusively the product development rights from our strength program 
we do not currently have any partners for our caring program 
under our current strategy  and for the foreseeable future  we do not expect to develop or market pharmaceutical or diagnostic products on our own 
as a result  our current and future revenues  in part  will depend on payments from our current hap tm partnership program and strength program partners and our future hap tm partnership  strength and caring program partners  if any  for either the new products they may develop  or for increased sales of their existing products  made possible through the use of our hap tm technology 
if we are unable to attract new hap tm partnership program and strength program partners or any partners for our caring program  we may never generate sufficient revenues to sustain our operations 
our partners for our hap tm partnership program and strength program and our partners  if any  for our caring program  will be responsible for pre clinical study and clinical development of therapeutic and diagnostic products and for regulatory approval  manufacturing and marketing of any products or enhanced marketing claims that result from the application of our hap tm technology 
our current agreements and we anticipate that our future agreements with partners for our hap tm partnership and strength programs and with partners  if any  for our caring program will allow them significant discretion in pursuing these activities 
we cannot control the amount and timing of resources that any such current or potential partners will devote to our programs or potential products 
our hap tm partnership program and strength program arrangements and our caring program arrangements  if any  may also have the effect of limiting the areas of research that we may pursue either alone or with others 
because part of our revenues will be dependent on the successful commercialization or development of our partners products  if  for any reason  a hap tm partnership program partner or our strength program partner delays or abandons its development or commercialization of a product developed using our hap tm technology  we may receive reduced royalty or other payments or no royalty or other payments at all 
in addition  because part of our future revenues will be dependent on the successful commercialization of additional aspects of our hap tm partnership and strength programs with partners and the successful commercialization of our caring program with partners  if  for any reason  a partner delays or abandons its development or commercialization of these additional aspects of our hap tm partnership program or strength program or its development or commercialization of our caring program  we may receive reduced royalty or other payments or no royalty or other payments at all 
although we intend to retain the rights to all hap tm markers  which we discover as well as to hap tm markers discovered jointly with our hap tm partnership and strength program partners and with our caring program partners  if any  we may not always be able to negotiate the retention of these rights 
furthermore  disputes may arise in the future over the ownership of rights to hap tm markers as well as any other technology we develop with our hap tm partnership and strength program partners or with our caring program partners  if any 
these and other possible disagreements between our hap tm partnership and strength program partners and us or between our caring program partners  if any  and us could lead to delays in the research  development or commercialization of their products 
these disagreements could also result in litigation or require arbitration to resolve 
any of these events could prevent us from effectively marketing our hap tm technology 
we invest considerable amounts of time  effort  and money to license our hap tm technology  and if we are unable to license our technology  we may not generate sufficient revenue to sustain our operations 
our ability to obtain partners for our hap tm partnership  strength and caring programs will depend in significant part upon the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries acceptance that our hap tm technology can help accelerate or improve their drug and diagnostic development and marketing efforts 
to achieve market acceptance  we must continue to educate the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries and the public in general as to the potential benefits of our hap tm partnership  strength and caring programs 
most importantly  we must convince the research and development  clinical and marketing departments of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that our hap tm technology can accelerate and improve the processes for developing  marketing and prescribing drugs and for developing and marketing diagnostics and that our hap tm partnership  strength and caring programs will be commercially viable 
if we fail to gain this acceptance  we may never generate sufficient revenues to sustain our operations 
we may expend substantial funds and management effort to market our hap tm partnership  strength and caring programs  without any resulting revenues 
our ability to make any acquisitions is dependent on the availability of adequate cash and the attractiveness of our stock price 
we anticipate that any future acquisitions of businesses or technologies will be financed through cash from operations  the issuance of shares of our common stock and or seller financing 
we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient existing capital resources or that we will be able to raise sufficient additional capital resources on terms satisfactory to us  if at all  in order to meet our capital requirements for such acquisitions 
we also believe that a significant factor in our ability to close acquisitions will be the attractiveness of our common stock for potential acquisition candidates 
this attractiveness may  in large part  be dependent upon the relative market price and capital appreciation prospects of our common stock compared to the equity securities of our competitors 
the trading price of our common stock on the nasdaq national market has affected and  could in the future materially adversely affect  our acquisition program 
integration of acquisitions or strategic investments could interrupt our business and our financial condition could be harmed 
from time to time  we may acquire or make strategic investments in other businesses or technologies 
any acquisitions or strategic investments we may make in the future may entail numerous risks that include the following difficulties integrating acquired operations  personnel  technologies or products  if any  diversion of management s focus from our core business concerns  entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience or knowledge  exposure to litigation from stockholders or creditors of  or other parties affiliated with  the target company or companies  dilution to existing stockholders and earnings per share  and incurrence of substantial debt 
any such difficulties encountered as a result of any mergers  acquisitions or strategic investments could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
if we are unable to prevent others from unauthorized use of  or are unable to defend our use of  our hap tm technology  trade secrets or know how  we may not be able to operate our business profitably 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may be able to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
the mere issuance of a patent does not guarantee that it is valid or enforceable  thus  even if we obtain patents  they may not be valid or enforceable against third parties 
we also rely upon unpatented trade secrets and improvements  unpatented know how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position 
we generally protect this information with reasonable security measures  including confidentiality agreements signed by our employees  academic collaborators and consultants that provide that all confidential information developed or made known to others during the course of the employment  consulting or business relationship will be kept confidential except in specified circumstances 
agreements with employees  consultants and collaborators generally provide that all inventions conceived by the individual while employed by us are our exclusive property 
if employees  consultants or collaborators do not honor these agreements  we may not have adequate remedies for breach 
furthermore  our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors 
further  a patent does not provide the patent holder with freedom to operate in a way that infringes the patent rights of others 
a third party may sue us for infringing on its patent rights 
likewise  we may need to resort to litigation to enforce a patent issued to us or to determine the scope and validity of third party proprietary rights 
the cost to us of any litigation or other proceeding relating to intellectual property rights  even if resolved in our favor  could be substantial  and the litigation would divert our management s efforts 
some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources 
uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could limit our ability to continue our operations 
if any party should successfully claim that the creation or use of our hap tm technology or hap tm marker association data infringe upon their intellectual property rights  in addition to any damages we might have to pay  a court could require us to stop the infringing activity or obtain a license on unfavorable terms 
moreover  any legal action against us or our hap tm partnership and strength program partners or any caring program partners claiming damages or seeking to enjoin commercial activities relating to the affected products and processes could  in addition to subjecting us to potential liability for damages  require us or our hap tm partnership and strength program partners or any caring program partners to obtain a license in order to continue to manufacture or market the affected products and processes 
any license required under any patent may not be made available on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition  some licenses may be non exclusive  and  therefore  our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us 
if we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to design around a patent  we may be unable to market effectively some of our hap tm technology  which could limit our profitability and possibly prevent us from generating revenue sufficient to sustain our operations 
regulatory oversight of our hap tm technology and public opinion regarding ethical issues surrounding the use of genetic information may adversely affect our ability to market our hap tm technology 
currently  there is limited fda regulation of genetic tests 
the secretary s advisory committee on genetic testing  an advisory panel to the secretary of the us department of health and human services  has recommended that the fda expand its regulation of genetic testing to require fda approval for all new genetic tests and labeling of genetic tests 
if the fda adopts this recommendation  it may require that we  or our partners  apply for fda approval as a prerequisite to marketing genetic tests that incorporate our hap tm technology 
if the fda were to deny any application of this kind  it could adversely affect our business and we may be unable to generate sufficient revenues to sustain our operations 
to date  the fda has not required  in connection with approving any drug  that a physician must have genomic variation information determined about a patient before the doctor prescribes a drug 
however  the fda  in one instance  has required that a physician must have gene expression information about a patient before the doctor prescribes the drug 
on january   the fda announced an initiative to help make innovative medical technology available sooner  including the use of pharmacogenomics during drug development 
the fda indicated that within six months the agency would issue guidance on when and how to submit pharmacogenomic information to the fda during the drug development process 
the fda said that this guidance would facilitate the exploratory use of pharmacogenomic screening during drug development and would clarify when such information would be considered part of the evaluation of drug safety 
in addition  the fda stated that the agency would hold a workshop in on issues that are involved in the co development of a pharmacogenomic test and a drug and that within months the agency would issue guidance on the regulatory pathway for such combinations through the agency s center for drug evaluation and research and the center for devices and radiological health 
our success will depend in part on what guidance the fda issues with regard to the use of genomic variation analysis as part of the drug approval process and  more specifically  the validity of our hap tm technology as a basis for identifying genomic variation and for correlating drug response with genomic variation 
without this acceptance by the fda and the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry  we may be unable to market effectively our hap tm technology and we may not generate sufficient revenues to sustain our operations 
within the field of personalized health and medicine  governmental and other entities may enact patient privacy and healthcare laws and regulations that may limit the use of genomic variation data 
to the extent that these laws and regulations limit the use of our hap tm technology or impose additional costs on our partners  we may be unable to market effectively our hap tm partnership  strength and caring programs and we may not generate sufficient revenues to sustain our operations 
additionally  public opinion on ethical issues related to the confidentiality and appropriate use of genetic testing results may influence governmental authorities to call for limits on  or regulation of the use of  genetic testing 
in addition  governmental authorities or other entities may call for limits on  or regulation of the use of  genetic testing or prohibit testing for genetic predisposition to certain conditions  particularly for those that have no known cure 
the occurrence of any of these events could reduce the potential markets for our hap tm technology  which could prevent us from generating sufficient revenues to sustain our operations 
furthermore  we may be directly subject to regulations as a provider of diagnostic information 
to the extent that these regulations restrict the sale of our hap tm technology or impose other costs  we may be unable to provide our hap tm technology to our customers on terms sufficient to recover our expenses 
if our partners do not seek  or do not receive  marketing approval for products developed  if any  using our hap tm technology  we may receive delayed royalty or other payments or no royalty or other payments at all 
any new drug  biologic  or new drug or biologic indication our partners develop using our hap tm technology must undergo an extensive regulatory review process in the united states and other countries before a new product or indication of this kind could be marketed 
this regulatory process can take many years and require substantial expense 
changes in fda policies and the policies of similar foreign regulatory bodies can prolong the regulatory review of each new drug or biologic license application or prevent approval of the application 
we expect similar delays and risks in the regulatory review process for any diagnostic product  whenever this regulatory review is required 
even if a product obtains marketing clearance  a marketed product and its manufacturer are subject to continuing review 
a manufacturer may be forced to withdraw a product from the market if a previously unknown problem with a product becomes apparent 
because our future revenues will be largely dependent on the successful commercialization or development of products using our hap tm technology  any delay in obtaining  failing to obtain  or failing to maintain regulatory approval for a product developed using our hap tm technology may delay our receipt of royalty or other payments or prevent us from receiving royalty or other payments sufficient to recover our expenses 
if our partners are unable to obtain fda approval for therapeutic or diagnostic products developed using our hap tm technology  the lack of regulatory approval will diminish the value of our hap tm technology 
to date  no one has developed or commercialized any therapeutic product or commercialized any diagnostic product using our hap tm technology 
we expect to rely on our partners for our hap tm partnership and strength programs and our partners  if any  for our caring program to file applications for regulatory approval and generally direct the regulatory review process and obtain fda acceptance of our hap tm partnership and strength programs and our caring programs  if any 
our partners for our hap tm partnership and strength programs or our partners  if any  for our caring program  may not submit an application for regulatory review 
even if they do submit applications  they may not be able to obtain marketing clearance for any products on a timely basis  if at all 
if our partners fail to obtain required governmental clearances for therapeutic or diagnostic products  they will not be able to market these products unless and until they obtain these clearances 
as a result  we may not receive royalty or other payments from our customers 
the occurrence of any of these events may prevent us from generating revenues sufficient to sustain our operations 
if we do not successfully distinguish and commercialize our hap tm technology  we may be unable to compete successfully with our competitors or to generate revenue significant to sustain our operations 
numerous entities are attempting to identify genomic variation predictive of specific diseases and drug response and to develop products and services based on these discoveries 
we face competition in these areas from pharmaceutical  biotechnology and diagnostic companies  academic and research institutions and government or other publicly funded agencies  both in the united states and abroad  most of which have substantially greater capital resources  research and development staffs  facilities  manufacturing and marketing experience  distribution channels and human resources than we do 
these competitors may discover  characterize or develop important technologies applying population genomics before us or our partners for our hap tm partnership and strength programs that are more effective than those technologies which we develop or which our partners for our hap tm partnership and strength programs develop  or these competitors may obtain regulatory approvals of their drugs and diagnostics more rapidly than our partners for our hap tm partnership and strength programs do  any of which could limit our ability to market effectively our hap tm technology 
some companies and governments are marketing or developing a number of databases and informatics tools to assist participants in the healthcare industry and academic researchers in the management and analysis of genomic data 
entities such as perlegen sciences  celera genomics group and the international hapmap project have developed or plan to develop databases containing gene sequence  genomic variation or other genomic information and are marketing or plan to market their data to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies or plan to make freely available their databases 
in addition  numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  such as glaxosmithkline plc  either alone or in partnership with our competitors  are developing genomic research programs that involve the use of information that can be found in these databases 
in order to compete against existing and future technologies  we will need to demonstrate to potential hap tm partnership  strength and caring program partners the value of our hap tm technology and that our hap tm technology and capabilities are superior to competing technologies 
although we believe that our focus on gene based hap tm markers  rather than random genomic snps or genome wide haplotypes  differentiates our hap tm technology from other technologies that our competitors are developing  any hap tm technology improvements we create may fail to achieve greater market acceptance than the technologies developed by our competitors 
genomic technologies have undergone  and are expected to continue to undergo  rapid and significant change 
our future success will depend in large part on maintaining a competitive position in the genomics field 
others may rapidly develop new technologies that may result in our products or technologies becoming obsolete before we recover the expenses that we incur in connection with the development of these products 
our hap tm technology could become obsolete if our competitors offer less expensive or more effective drug discovery and development technologies  including technologies that may be unrelated to genomics 
if we fail to maintain our computer hardware  software and related infrastructure  we could experience loss of  or delay in  revenues and market acceptance 
because our business requires manipulating and analyzing large amounts of data  we depend on the continuous  effective  reliable and secure operation of our computer hardware  software and related infrastructure 
to the extent that our hardware or software malfunctions  we will experience reduced productivity 
we protect our computer hardware through physical and software safeguards 
however  our computer hardware is still vulnerable to fire  weather  earthquake  or other natural disaster and power loss  telecommunications failures  physical or software break ins and similar events 
in addition  the software and algorithmic components of our decogen registered trademark informatics system are complex and sophisticated  and as such  could contain data  design or software errors that could be difficult to detect and correct 
users of our system may find software defects in current or future products 
if we fail to maintain the necessary computer capacity and data to support our computational needs and our customers drug and diagnostic discovery and development efforts  we could experience a loss in revenues  or a delay in receiving revenues and a delay in obtaining market acceptance for our technology 
our operating results may fluctuate significantly and any failure to meet financial expectations may disappoint securities analysts or investors and result in a decline in our common stock price 
our operating results have fluctuated in the past and we expect they will fluctuate in the future 
these fluctuations could cause our common stock price to decline 
some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include recognition of non recurring revenues due to receipt of license fees  achievement of milestones  completion of contracts or other revenues  demand for and market acceptance of our hap tm partnership  strength and caring programs  timing of the execution of agreements on our hap tm partnership  strength and caring programs and other material contracts  our competitors announcements or introduction of new products  services or technological innovations  disputes regarding patents or other intellectual property rights  securities class actions or other litigation  adverse changes in the level of economic activity in the united states and other major regions in which we do business  and general and industry specific economic conditions  which may affect our partners use of our hap tm technology 
due to volatile and unpredictable revenues and operating expenses  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations may not be a good indication of our future performance 
it is possible that  in some future periods  our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
in this event  the market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly or decline 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is principally confined to our cash equivalents and investments  all of which have maturities of less than months 
we maintain a non trading investment portfolio of investment grade  liquid debt securities that limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer or type of instrument 
the weighted average interest rate on marketable securities at december   was approximately 
in view of the nature and mix of our total portfolio  a movement in market interest rates would not have a significant impact on the total value of our investment portfolio as of december  on december   we had aggregate fixed rate debt of approximately million  including borrowings outstanding under term loans and capital lease obligations 
the weighted average interest rate on this debt at december   was approximately 
a change in this interest rate would cause a corresponding increase in our annual expense of approximately
