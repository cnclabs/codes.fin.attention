item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the sonic automotive  inc and subsidiaries consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview we are one of the largest automotive retailers in the united states 
as of march  we operated dealership franchises  representing different brands of cars and light trucks  at locations and collision repair centers in states 
our dealerships provide comprehensive services including sales of both new and used cars and light trucks  sales of replacement parts  performance of vehicle maintenance  warranty  paint and collision repair services  and arrangement of extended warranty contracts  financing and insurance for our customers 
our brand diversity allows us to offer a broad range of products at a wide range of prices from lower priced  or economy vehicles  to luxury vehicles 
we believe that this diversity reduces the risk of changes in customer preferences  product supply shortages and aging products 
in addition  although vehicle sales are cyclical and are affected by many factors  including general economic conditions  consumer confidence  levels of discretionary personal income  interest rates and available credit  our parts  service and collision repair services are not closely tied to vehicle sales and are not dependent upon near term sales volume 
as a result  we believe the diversity of these products and services reduces the risk of periodic economic downturns 

table of contents the following table depicts the breakdown of our new vehicle revenues by brand for each of the past three years percentage of new vehicle revenues year ended december  brand general motors ford honda toyota bmw chrysler lexus nissan other luxury other total in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 adopted january   revenue data in prior years reflects the reclassification of the results of operations of all dealerships sold during or held for sale as of december  to discontinued operations

includes chrysler  dodge  jeep  and plymouth 
includes acura  audi  hummer  infiniti  land rover  mercedes  porsche  saab  and volvo 
includes hyundai  isuzu  kia  lincoln  mazda  mercury  mitsubishi  subaru  and volkswagen 
we sell similar products and services  use similar processes in selling our products and services and sell our products and services to similar classes of customers 
as a result of this and the way we manage our business  we have aggregated our results into a single segment for purposes of reporting financial condition and results of operations 
we have accounted for all of our dealership acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting and  as a result  we do not include in our consolidated financial statements the results of operations of these dealerships prior to the date they were acquired 
our consolidated financial statements discussed below reflect the results of operations  financial position and cash flows of each of our dealerships acquired prior to december  as a result of the effects of our acquisitions and other potential factors in the future  the historical consolidated financial information described in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations  financial position and cash flows which would have resulted had such acquisitions occurred at the beginning of the periods presented  nor is it indicative of future results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
use of estimates and critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require the most subjective and complex judgments 
following is a discussion of 
table of contents what we believe are our critical accounting policies and estimates 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding our accounting policies 
finance and service contracts we arrange financing for customers through various financial institutions and receive a commission from the lender equal to the difference between the actual interest rates charged to customers and the predetermined base rates set by the financing institution 
we also receive commissions from the sale of various insurance contracts and non recourse third party extended service contracts to customers 
under these contracts  the applicable manufacturer or third party warranty company is directly liable for all warranties provided within the contract 
in the event a customer terminates a financing  insurance or warranty contract prior to the original termination date  we may be required to return a portion of the commission revenue originally recorded to the third party provider chargebacks 
the commission revenue for the sale of these products and services is recorded net of estimated chargebacks at the time of sale 
our estimate of future chargebacks is established based on our historical chargeback rates and the termination provisions of the applicable contracts 
while chargeback rates vary depending on the type of contract sold  a basis point increase in the estimated chargeback rates used in determining our estimates of future chargebacks would have resulted in an additional million in recorded chargebacks 
goodwill goodwill and other intangible assets having indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment at least annually  or more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that impairment might have occurred 
in evaluating goodwill for impairment  we compare the carrying value to the fair value of the underlying businesses 
we use various assumptions in determining fair value  including estimates of future earnings  future growth rates  earnings multiples and discount factors 
we are subject to financial statement risk to the extent goodwill balances are impaired due to decreases in the fair market value of the underlying businesses 
insurance reserves we have various self insured and high deductible insurance programs which require us to make estimates in determining the ultimate liability we may incur for claims arising under these programs 
these insurance reserves are estimated by management using actuarial evaluations based on historical claims experience  claims processing procedures  medical cost trends and  in the case of reserves for workers compensation claims  a discount factor 
at december   we had million reserved for such programs 
for each one percentage point increase in the assumed medical trend rate  the reserve for our medical insurance program would increase by  each one day increase in the average claim lag would cause the reserve to increase by  we used an experience modification factor in estimating reserves for workers compensation claims of 
a change of five basis points in this factor would change the reserve by  we also used a discount rate of to calculate the present value of our estimated workers compensation claims 
a change of basis points in the discount rate would change the reserve by  legal proceedings sonic is involved  and will continue to be involved  in numerous legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of our business  including litigation with customers  employment related lawsuits  contractual disputes and actions brought by governmental authorities 
currently  no legal proceedings are pending against or involve sonic that  in the opinion of management  could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
however  the results of these proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty  and an unfavorable resolution of one or more of these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and prospects 
recent accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets in june among other things  sfas no longer permits the amortization of goodwill  but requires that the carrying amount of goodwill be reviewed and 
table of contents reduced with a charge against operations if it is found to be impaired 
sfas also requires the amortization of intangible assets other than goodwill over their useful economic lives  unless the useful economic life is determined to be indefinite 
intangible assets determined to have a finite life are required to be reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
intangible assets that are determined to have an indefinite economic life are not amortized and must be reviewed for impairment in accordance with the terms of sfas we have not recognized any impairment related to the goodwill or other intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet 
the provisions of sfas applied immediately to all acquisitions completed after june  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives existing at june  were amortized until december  effective january   such amortization ceased  as all of the provisions became effective on that date 
we also adopted the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets as of january  sfas establishes a single accounting model for assets to be disposed of by sale whether previously held and used or newly acquired 
sfas requires certain long lived assets to be reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value  less cost to sell  and provides guidance in asset valuation and measuring impairment 
the results of operations of those dealerships disposed of and those dealerships held for sale are now required to be reflected in discontinued operations as shown in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
prior to adoption  gains or losses resulting from extinguishment of debt were required to be classified as extraordinary items  net of related tax effects 
upon adoption of sfas  however  the classification of such gains or losses as extraordinary must be evaluated based on the criteria established in apb opinion no 
gains and losses not meeting that criterion  including gains and losses classified as extraordinary in prior periods  must be classified in income from operations 
we adopted the provisions of sfas effective july  accordingly  gains or losses incurred on the early extinguishment of debt debt repurchases have been included in other income in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas requires the recognition of a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity at the time the liability is incurred  rather than at the date of the entity s commitment to the exit or disposal plan 
the provisions of sfas are effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material effect on our consolidated operating results  financial position  or cash flows 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires the recognition of a liability for certain guarantees issued after december   or for modifications made after december  to previously issued guarantees  and clarifies disclosure requirements for certain guarantees 
the disclosure provisions of fin are effective for fiscal years ended after december  we have adopted the disclosure provisions of fin as of december  in january  the fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of apb no 
fin requires the consolidation of certain variable interest entities by the primary beneficiary if the equity investors do not have a controlling financial interest or sufficient equity at risk to finance the entities activities without additional subordinated financial support of other parties 
the provisions of fin are effective for all variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to that date  the provisions of fin must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  the adoption of fin is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 

table of contents results of operations the following table summarizes the percentages of total revenues represented by certain items reflected in our consolidated statements of income 
percentage of total revenues for the year ended december  revenues new vehicles used vehicles wholesale vehicles parts  service and collision repair finance and insurance and other total revenues cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative depreciation goodwill amortization operating income interest expense  floor plan interest expense  other income from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense net income from continuing operations see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
during the year ended december   we disposed of franchises and had approved  but not completed  the disposition of ten additional franchises 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas  the results of operations of these dealerships  including gains or losses on disposition  have been included in net income from discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for all periods presented 
in addition to these dispositions  during the year ended december  and  we disposed of and franchises  respectively 
however  because the provisions of sfas do not permit retroactive application to dispositions occurring before january   the results of operations of these dealerships have been included in net income from continuing operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
as a result  a comparison of the results of operations based on the information presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of income is not meaningful since the information presented for and includes results of operations for dealerships disposed in those years that were not in existence in therefore  in order to provide a more meaningful comparison  the tables included within the discussion below disaggregate the impact of the dealerships disposed in prior years in order to arrive at a comparison of only the results of operations of ongoing operations 
annual same store results of operations represent the aggregate of the same store results for each quarter 
same store results for each quarter include dealerships that were owned and operated for the entire quarter in both periods 

table of contents revenues for the year ended change change for the year ended change change total revenues in thousands same store acquisitions total ongoing dealerships disposed prior to total as reported revenues from ongoing dealerships increased in as a result of acquired dealerships  while same store revenues declined compared to  which was the second best year in history for sales of light vehicles in the united states 
the primary factor causing this decline was reduced consumer spending resulting from a downturn in economic conditions as described in more detail below 
reduced consumer spending may continue to affect future revenues as economic conditions remain uncertain 
in addition  uncertainty associated with potential us military action in the middle east may also affect future revenues 
revenues from ongoing dealerships increased in as a result of acquired dealerships  while same store revenues declined compared to  driven by lower vehicle revenues primarily in our northern california and carolina regions 
new vehicles for the year ended units or change change for the year ended units or change change total new vehicle units same store acquisitions total ongoing dealerships disposed prior to total as reported total new vehicle revenues in thousands same store acquisitions total ongoing dealerships disposed prior to total as reported total new vehicle unit price same store total ongoing dealerships the decline in same store unit sales during the year ended december  was consistent with an industry wide decline in new vehicle sales 
this decline was particularly evident in domestic brands  which are generally more sensitive to economic conditions than import and luxury brands 
sales of domestic non luxury brands declined approximately for the year ended december  and accounted for approximately of the total decline in same store unit sales 
regional performance continued to be negatively affected by weaker economic conditions in our northern california region  evidenced by significantly higher unemployment rates compared to the rest of the country 
same store unit sales in that region declined by  units  or 
similar economic conditions in the dallas market resulted in same store unit sales declines of  units or 
our ohio and carolinas regions experienced same store declines of and respectively  due 
table of contents primarily to a predominance of domestic brand stores in those markets 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in unit sales in regions whose portfolios are dominated by import and luxury brands  primarily san diego nevada  where units sales increased  units  or  and south carolina georgia  where units sales increased units  or  compared to the same period last year 
we expect declines in same store new vehicle sales to continue during in  the decline in same store unit sales was primarily isolated to domestic brands 
sales of domestic brands on a same store basis declined by  units  or  and accounted for of the total decline in same store unit sales 
as such  our regions dominated by domestic brands  such as northern california and carolinas  were particularly affected 
same store unit sales declined by  units or   and by  units  or  in those two regions respectively  compared to sales of import brands on a same store basis declined by only  units  or  in used vehicles for the year ended units or change change for the year ended units or change change total used vehicle units same store acquisitions total ongoing dealerships disposed prior to total as reported total used vehicle revenues in thousands same store acquisitions total ongoing dealerships disposed prior to total as reported total used vehicle unit price same store total ongoing dealerships during  used vehicle unit sales were negatively affected by a lack of adequate consumer credit availability 
this was caused by many of the manufacturers captive finance companies focusing their financing of new vehicle sales and  to a lesser extent  used vehicle sales only at those dealerships selling their brands and tightening of credit standards by other finance companies 
these factors have adversely affected consumers ability to finance used vehicle purchases  which reduces retail activity 
also contributing to the decline in used vehicle sales were competitive pressures from strong manufacturer incentives and interest rate subsidies on new vehicles 
our oklahoma region  which has historically been heavily dependent on used vehicle sales  especially the sub prime market  was particularly affected by these trends 
same store unit sales declined  units  or 
unit sales in our southeast division declined  units  or 
these regions accounted for of the total decline in same store unit sales for during  of the decline in same store unit sales was the southeast division  primarily the carolinas region which declined  units  or  the south carolina georgia region which declined  units  or  and the birmingham tennessee region which declined units  or  compared to 
table of contents wholesale vehicles for the year ended units or change change for the year ended units or change total wholesale vehicle units same store acquisitions total ongoing dealerships disposed prior to total as reported total wholesale vehicle revenues in thousands same store acquisitions total ongoing dealerships disposed prior to total as reported total wholesale unit price same store total ongoing dealerships during  the decrease in same store wholesale vehicle revenues is due to a decrease in units sold  offset by an increase in average price per unit  primarily resulting from wholesaling higher end models in order to liquidate aged units and maintain appropriate inventory levels 
during  the majority of the decline in same store sales resulted from a decline in units sold  coupled with a lower selling price caused by the declines in values of used units at the wholesale level  especially in the fourth quarter 
fixed operations for the year ended change change for the year ended change change total parts  service and collision repair in thousands same store acquisitions total ongoing dealerships disposed prior to total as reported same store parts  service and collision repair revenues increased during  resulting primarily from increases in warranty sales arising in part from bmw expanding their warranty to cover all new vehicle maintenance and honda extending its warranty on two models due to problems with its v engines 
in addition  we continued implementation of our best practices and investments in real estate and construction projects on collision facilities  which allowed us to increase our overall service and parts capacity 
these increases were partially offset by significant declines in our ford stores of million  or  resulting from unusually high parts and service sales generated in by the firestone tire recall and other recalls 
in addition  collision revenues were adversely affected by rising insurance premiums that have caused consumers to obtain higher deductible policies 
lower collision revenues in are a result of customers choosing not to perform minor repair work that historically would have been covered by lower deductible policies  as well as a change in insurance company trends whereby vehicles are being declared totaled rather than repaired at a greater percentage than in prior years 

table of contents same store revenues increased during  resulting in part from investments in real estate and construction projects on collision facilities  which allowed us to increase our overall service and parts capacity  as well as an increase at our ford stores of million or  resulting in part from unusually high parts and service sales generated in by the firestone tire recall and other recalls 
finance and insurance for the year ended change change for the year ended change change total finance insurance revenue in thousands same store acquisitions total ongoing dealerships disposed prior to total as reported total f i per unit same store total ongoing dealerships same store finance and insurance revenues decreased during primarily due to lower retail vehicle unit sales 
unit sales were negatively impacted by the decline in retail vehicle unit sales in our northern california market  and in our ohio  carolinas and dallas regions 
finance and insurance revenues in these markets declined million or  million or  million or and million or  respectively  compared to these declines were offset by strong performance in our san diego nevada region  driven by a higher import and luxury brand mix  where revenues increased million or compared to during  the increase in same store finance and insurance revenues was primarily due to an increase in per unit revenue  which reflected our continued focus on training programs for finance and insurance sales people along with our ability to negotiate higher commissions on the origination of customer vehicle financing  insurance polices and extended warranty contracts 
gross profit and gross margins for the year ended change change for the year ended change change total gross profit in thousands same store acquisitions total ongoing dealerships disposed prior to total as reported our overall gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of revenues gross margins generally vary depending on changes in our revenue mix 
although sales of new vehicles comprise the majority of our total revenues  new vehicles generally carry the lowest margin of any product or service we offer  generally averaging between and 
as a result  sales of new vehicles comprise a relatively small portion of total gross profits 
retail sales of used vehicles generally carry a slightly higher gross margin than new vehicles  averaging between and 
parts  service  and collision repair carry the next highest margins  averaging between and 
commission revenues from the sale of finance  insurance and extended warranty products carry the highest margin at 
as a result  as our mix of revenues shifts between lower margin products and services to higher margin products and services  overall gross margins fluctuate accordingly 

table of contents during  gross margins from ongoing dealerships remained stable at 
we experienced an increase during in the percentage of revenues contributed by parts  service and collision repair services 
in addition  the gross profit percentage earned on our parts  service  and collision repair services increased to in from in this was offset by a slight decrease in the percentage of revenues contributed by our finance and insurance products to in from in  and an increase in the percentage of revenues contributed by new vehicle sales to in from in ongoing dealership gross margin during increased to from due primarily to an increase in the percentage of revenues contributed by parts  service  collision repair services and finance and insurance products 
parts  service and collision repair revenues as a percentage of total revenues increased to in from in finance and insurance revenues as a percentage of total revenues increased to in from in in addition  the gross profit percentage earned on our parts  service  and collision repair and finance and insurance products increased to in from in selling  general administrative expenses for the year ended change change for the year ended change change total sg a in thousands same store acquisitions total ongoing dealerships disposed prior to total as reported of our total selling  general and administrative expenses from ongoing dealerships in  approximately were variable  comprised primarily of non salaried sales compensation and advertising  and approximately were fixed  comprised primarily of fixed compensation and rent expense 
we manage these variable expenses so that they are generally related to vehicle sales gross profit and can be adjusted in response to changes in vehicle sales gross profit 
salespersons  sales managers  service managers  parts managers  service advisors  service technicians and all other non clerical dealership personnel are paid either a commission or a modest salary plus commissions 
in addition  dealership management compensation is tied to individual dealership profitability 
as a percentage of gross profits  variable expenses from ongoing dealerships increased to in from in this was primarily due to increases in compensation expense as a percentage of gross profits to in  from in this resulted primarily from higher sales incentives at our massey dealerships acquired in march  which are expected to more closely align with sonic best practices as integration continues  as well as additional sales incentives designed to increase sales volume and achieve optimal inventory levels 
variable expenses from ongoing dealerships also increased due to an increase in advertising expense 
as a percentage of gross profits  advertising expense increased to in from in this resulted from a determined effort  primarily in the first half of  to stimulate consumer traffic into our dealerships through advertising 
our advertising expenditures began to stabilize in the second half of fixed expenses from ongoing dealerships increased as a percentage of gross profits to in from in this was primarily the result of significant investments in regional and divisional management personnel in advance of our recent acquisitions  including the massey acquisition  in order to support our acquisition growth and integration plans  and was also impacted by a softer vehicle sales environment which led to reduced gross profit dollars  especially in the fourth quarter 

table of contents of our total selling  general and administrative expenses in  approximately were variable  and approximately were fixed 
as a percentage of gross profits  variable expenses declined slightly in to from in these declines were offset by fixed expenses  which increased as a percentage of gross profits to in from in  primarily as a result of increases in rent expense due to investments in dealership facilities and increases in medical insurance costs 
depreciation and amortization for the year ended change change for the year ended change change total depreciation in thousands same store acquisitions total ongoing dealerships disposed prior to total as reported during  the balance of gross property and equipment  excluding land and construction in process  increased million  or 
approximately million of this increase resulted from additional capital expenditures and approximately million from dealership acquisitions 
these increases were offset by million of disposals and other adjustments  including transfers to assets held for sale of million 
as a percentage of total revenues depreciation expense was in both and during  the balance of gross property and equipment  excluding land and construction in process  increased approximately million 
approximately million of this increase resulted from dealership acquisitions and approximately million from additional capital expenditures 
as a percentage of total revenues  depreciation expense was at in and in accordance with sfas  beginning january   goodwill is no longer amortized 
accordingly  no amortization expense was recorded during amortization expense from ongoing operations in was million an increase of compared to the increase was primarily attributable to additional goodwill arising from acquisitions completed prior to july  floor plan interest expense for the year ended change change for the year ended change change interest expense  floor plan in thousands total ongoing dealerships disposed prior to total as reported the average interest rate incurred by ongoing dealerships was for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december   which reduced interest expense by approximately million 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in floor plan balances during the average floor plan balance increased from million at december  to million at december   resulting in an increase in expense of approximately million 
the average interest rate incurred by ongoing dealerships was for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december   which reduced interest expense by approximately million 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in floor plan balances during the average floor plan balance increased from million at december  to million at december   resulting in an increase in expense of approximately million 

table of contents our floor plan expenses are substantially offset by amounts received from manufacturers in the form of floor plan assistance 
these payments are credited against our cost of sales 
during the year ended december   the amounts we received from floor plan assistance exceeded our floor plan interest expense by approximately million 
conversely  in the year ended december   floor plan interest expense exceeded amounts received for floor plan assistance by approximately million 
other interest expense during  other interest expense from ongoing operations increased million  or  compared to the same period last year 
interest expense increased million as a result of the issuance of an additional million in senior subordinated notes in november and an additional million in convertible senior subordinated notes in may  but was offset partially by a million decrease in interest expense on our revolving credit facility 
of this decrease  approximately million was due to a decrease in the average interest rate from in to in  and approximately million was due to a decrease in the average outstanding balance resulting from the refinancing of a portion of our revolving facility using proceeds from the issuance of convertible senior subordinated notes discussed above  offset partially by borrowings used to finance acquisition activities 
the decrease in the weighted average interest rates and average balances was offset by the effective conversion of million of our variable rate debt to a fixed rate through two separate million interest rate swap agreements entered into on january  and june   whereby we receive interest payments based on libor and make interest payments at fixed rates of and  respectively 
the effect of the swaps resulted in an additional million in interest expense in in addition  the increase in interest expense was partially offset by an increase in the capitalization of interest cost on construction projects of million in during  other interest expense from ongoing operations decreased by million  or  compared to of the total decrease  approximately million was attributable to the decrease in the average interest rate incurred on our revolving credit facility to approximately in from in this decrease was partially offset by an increase in the average outstanding balance of the revolving credit facility to million in from million in due to additional borrowings for acquisitions 
liquidity and capital resources we require cash to finance acquisitions and fund debt service and working capital requirements 
we rely on cash flows from operations  borrowings under our various credit facilities and offerings of debt and equity securities to meet these requirements 
although not required under the terms of any credit agreement  our practice has been to apply all of our available cash to reduce the outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility for the purpose of maximizing the return on these funds and minimizing interest expense 
because the majority of our consolidated assets are held by our subsidiaries  the majority of our cash flow from operations is generated by these subsidiaries 
as a result  our cash flow and ability to service debt depends to a substantial degree on the results of operations of these subsidiaries and their ability to provide us with cash 
uncertainties in the economic environment as well as uncertainties associated with potential us military action in the middle east may affect our overall liquidity 
contracts in transit contracts in transit represent customer finance contracts evidencing loan agreements or lease agreements between sonic  as creditor  and the customer  as borrower  to acquire or lease a vehicle where a third party finance source has given sonic initial  non binding approval to assume sonic s position as creditor 
funding and final approval from the finance source is provided upon the finance source s review of the loan or lease agreement and related documentation executed by the customer at the dealership 
these finance contracts are typically funded within ten days of the initial approval of the finance transaction given by the third party finance 
table of contents source 
the finance source is not contractually obligated to make the loan or lease to the customer until it gives its final approval and funds the transaction  and until such final approval is given  the contracts in transit represent amounts due from the customer to sonic 
based on our experience  there is minimal risk of these contracts in transit not being approved and funded by the initial finance source 
in rare instances where the pre approving initial finance source does not give final approval of the loan or lease agreement  we are typically able to arrange for financing through another third party finance source 
because contracts in transit are typically funded within ten days after the initial approval given by the finance source  we do not believe that they have any meaningful impact on our liquidity 
floor plan facilities we finance all of our new and certain of our used vehicle inventory through standardized floor plan credit facilities with chrysler financial company  llc chrysler financial  ford motor credit company ford credit  general motors acceptance corporation gmac  toyota motor credit corporation toyota credit and bank of america  na these floor plan facilities bear interest at variable rates based on prime and libor 
the weighted average interest rate for our floor plan facilities was for and for interest payments under each of our floor plan facilities are due monthly  and we are generally not required to make principal repayments prior to the sale of the vehicles 
the balances outstanding are due when the related vehicles are sold and are collateralized by vehicle inventories and other assets  excluding franchise agreements  of the relevant dealership subsidiary 
the floor plan facilities contain a number of covenants  including  among others  covenants restricting us with respect to the creation of liens and changes in ownership  officers and key management personnel 
we were in compliance with all restrictive covenants as of december  long term debt and credit facilities the revolving facility at december  sonic s revolving credit facility with ford credit  chrysler financial and toyota credit the revolving facility had a borrowing limit of million  subject to a borrowing base calculated on the basis of our receivables  inventory and equipment and a pledge of certain additional collateral by an affiliate of sonic the borrowing base was approximately million at december  
the amounts outstanding under the revolving facility bore interest during at percentage points above libor 
the revolving facility includes an annual commitment fee equal to of the unused portion of the facility 
the total outstanding balance was approximately million as of december  balances under our revolving facility are guaranteed by sonic s operating subsidiaries 
on february  we amended certain terms of our revolving facility 
we added bank of america  na to the lending group and extended the term of the facility from october  to october  in addition  the overall borrowing limit was reduced to million and the interest rate was changed to libor plus percentage points 
the reduction in the overall limit had no impact on our borrowing base and thus  no effect on our borrowing availability at december  all of the other substantive provisions  including covenants  remained the same

the initial conversion price per share is  which is subject to adjustment for certain distributions on  or changes in our class a common stock  if any  prior to the conversion date 
in addition  on or before may   a holder also may convert his notes into shares of our class a common stock at any time after a consecutive trading day period in which the average of the trading day prices for the notes for that trading day period is less than of the average conversion value for the notes during that period 
the conversion value is equal to the product of the closing sale price for our class a common stock on a given day multiplied by the then current conversion rate  which is the number of shares of class a common stock into which each  principal amount of notes is then convertible 
these notes were not convertible as of december  in  we repurchased million in aggregate principal amount of the convertible notes on the open market for approximately million

the mortgage facility prior to december   we had a million revolving construction line of credit with ford credit bearing interest at percentage points above libor 
in addition  we had a million real estate acquisition line of credit with ford credit bearing interest at percentage points above libor 
on december   we replaced the ford credit facilities with a revolving real estate acquisition and construction line of credit the construction loan and a related mortgage refinancing facility the permanent loan and collectively with the construction loan  the mortgage facility with toyota credit 
under the construction loan  our dealership development subsidiaries can borrow up to million to finance land acquisition and dealership construction costs 
advances can be made under the construction loan until november all advances will mature on december   bear interest at percentage points above libor and are secured by sonic s guarantee and a lien on all of the borrowing subsidiaries real estate and other assets 
under the permanent loan  we can refinance up to million in advances under the construction loan once the projects are completed and can finance real estate acquisition costs to the extent these costs were not previously financed under the construction loan 
advances can be made under the permanent loan until december all advances under the permanent loan mature on december   bear interest at above libor and are secured by the same collateral given under the construction loan 

table of contents the mortgage facility allows us to borrow up to million in the aggregate under the construction loan and the permanent loan 
the mortgage facility is not cross collateralized with the revolving facility  however  a default under one will cause a default under the other 
we were in compliance with all of the restrictive and financial covenants under the mortgage facility at december  dealership acquisitions during  we acquired dealerships for a combined purchase price of million in cash and  shares of class a common stock valued at approximately million 
the total purchase price for the acquisitions was based on our internally determined valuation of the dealerships and their assets 
the cash portion of the purchase price was financed by cash generated from our existing operations and by borrowings under our revolving facility 
sale leaseback transactions in an effort to generate additional capital  we typically seek to structure our operations to minimize the ownership of real property 
as a result  facilities either constructed by us or obtained in acquisitions are typically sold to third parties in sale leaseback transactions 
the resulting leases generally have initial terms of years and include a series of five year renewal options 
we have no continuing obligations under these arrangements other than lease payments 
the majority of our sale leaseback transactions are done with capital automotive reit  which is not affiliated with sonic 
in  we sold million in dealership properties in sale leaseback transactions 
there were no material gains or losses on these sales 
capital expenditures our capital expenditures include the construction of new dealerships and collision repair centers  building improvements and equipment purchased for use in our dealerships 
capital expenditures in were approximately million  of which approximately million related to the construction of new dealerships and collision repair centers and real estate acquired in connection with such construction 
once completed  these new dealerships and collision repair centers are generally sold in sale leaseback transactions 
after considering proceeds from real estate sales and sale leaseback transactions  as well as the balance of projects in progress expected to be sold in sale leaseback transactions  capital expenditures were million 
we do not expect any significant gains or losses from these sales 
stock repurchase program our board of directors has authorized sonic to expend up to million to repurchase shares of our class a common stock or redeem securities convertible into class a common stock 
during  we repurchased  shares of class a common stock totaling approximately million 
subsequent to december   we have repurchased an additional  shares of our class a common stock for approximately million 
as of march  we had million remaining under the board authorization 
cash flows cash provided by operating activities includes net income adjusted for the effects of non cash items such as depreciation and amortization  and the effects of changes in working capital 
during  net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million 
changes in inventory in  net of notes payable floor plan  resulted primarily from an increase in inventory levels created by lower demand 
changes in other working capital balances  including accounts receivable  accounts payable and other accrued liabilities  are attributed to differences in timing of payments 

table of contents cash used for investing activities in was approximately million  the majority of which was related to dealership acquisitions 
our other principal investing activities include capital expenditures and dealership dispositions 
during  net cash provided by financing activities was approximately million and primarily related to million of proceeds received from the issuance of convertible senior subordinated notes offset by repurchases of class a common stock and repayments on our revolving credit facilities 
guarantees in accordance with the terms of our real estate lease agreements  our dealership subsidiaries  acting as lessees  generally agree to indemnify the lessor from certain liabilities arising as a result of the use of the leased premises  including environmental liabilities and repairs to leased property upon termination of the lease 
sonic s exposure with respect to these items is difficult to quantify 
in addition  sonic has generally agreed to indemnify the lessor in the event of a breach of the lease by the dealership subsidiary 
in accordance with the terms of agreements entered into for the sale of our dealership franchises  sonic generally agrees to indemnify the buyer from certain liabilities and costs arising from operations or events that occur prior to the sale but which may or may not be known at the time of sale  including environmental liabilities  and liabilities resulting from the breach of representations or warranties made under the agreement 
these indemnifications generally expire within a period of one to two years following the date of sale  and sonic s exposure is generally limited to dollar amounts ranging from  to million as specified within the agreements 
in connection with dealership dispositions  certain of our dealership subsidiaries have assigned or sublet to the buyer their interests in real property leases associated with such dealerships 
in general  the subsidiaries retain responsibility for the performance of certain obligations under such leases  including rent payments  environmental remediation  and repairs to leased property upon termination of the lease  to the extent that the assignee or sublessee does not perform 
while sonic s exposure with respect to environmental remediation and repairs is difficult to quantify  the total estimated rent payments remaining under such leases as of december  was approximately million based on lease expiration dates ranging from october  to july  however  in accordance with the terms of the assignment and sublease agreements  the assignees and sublessees have generally agreed to indemnify sonic and its subsidiaries in the event of non performance 
future liquidity outlook our obligations under our existing credit facilities  indentures and leasing programs are as follows amounts in thousands thereafter total floorplan financing long term debt operating leases we believe our best source of liquidity for future growth remains cash flows generated from operations combined with our availability of borrowings under our floor plan financing or any replacements thereof and other credit arrangements 
though uncertainties in the economic environment as well as uncertainties associated with potential us military action in the middle east may affect our ability to generate cash from operations  we expect to generate more than sufficient cash flow to fund our debt service and working capital requirements and any seasonal operating requirements  including our currently anticipated internal growth for our existing businesses  for the foreseeable future 
once these needs are met  we may use remaining cash flow to support our acquisition strategy or repurchase shares of our class a common stock or publicly traded debt securities  as market conditions warrant 

table of contents seasonality our operations are subject to seasonal variations 
the first and fourth quarters generally contribute less revenue and operating profits than the second and third quarters 
weather conditions  the timing of manufacturer incentive programs and model changeovers cause seasonality in new vehicle demand 
parts and service demand remains more stable throughout the year 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our variable rate floor plan notes payable  revolving credit facility borrowings and other variable rate notes expose us to risks caused by fluctuations in the applicable interest rates 
the total outstanding balance of such variable instruments after considering the effect of our interest rate swaps see below was approximately million at december  and approximately million at december  a change of basis points in the underlying interest rate would have caused a change in interest expense of approximately million in and approximately million in of the total change in interest expense  approximately million in and approximately million in would have resulted from floor plan notes payable 
our exposure with respect to floor plan notes payable is mitigated by floor plan assistance payments received from manufacturers that are generally based on rates similar to those incurred under our floor plan financing arrangements 
these payments are credited against our cost of sales 
during  the amounts we received from manufacturer floor plan assistance exceeded our floor plan interest expense by approximately million 
a change in interest rates of basis points would have had an estimated impact on floor plan assistance of approximately million in in addition to our variable rate debt  we also have lease agreements on a portion of our dealership facilities where the monthly lease payment fluctuates based on libor interest rates 
many of our lease agreements have interest rate floors whereby our lease expense would not fluctuate significantly in periods when libor is relatively low 
in order to reduce our exposure to market risks from fluctuations in interest rates  we entered into two separate interest rate swap agreements on january  and june  to effectively convert a portion of our libor based variable rate debt to a fixed rate 
the swaps each have a notional principal amount of million and mature on october  and june   respectively 
under the terms of the swap agreement entered into on january   we receive interest payments on the notional amount at a rate equal to the one month libor rate  adjusted monthly  and make interest payments at a fixed rate of 
under the terms of the swap agreement entered into on june   we receive interest payments on the notional amount at a rate equal to the one month libor rate  adjusted monthly  and make interest payments at a fixed rate of 
incremental interest expense incurred the difference between interest received and interest paid as a result of these interest rate swaps was million in and has been included in interest expense  other in the accompanying consolidated statement of income 
the interest rate swaps have been designated and qualify as cash flow hedges and  as a result  changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps have been recorded in other comprehensive loss  net of related income taxes  in our statement of stockholders equity
