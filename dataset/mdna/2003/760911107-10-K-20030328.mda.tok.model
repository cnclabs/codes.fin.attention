our research and development expenses consist of costs incurred for internal and external research and development 
these costs include direct and indirect overhead expenses

the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
an example of a critical estimate is the full valuation allowance for deferred taxes that was recorded based on the uncertainty that such tax benefits will be realized in future periods 
controls and procedures we maintain a system of controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the reliability of the financial statements and other disclosures included in this report  as well as to safeguard assets from unauthorized use or disposition 
we evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures under the supervision and with the participation of management  including our chief executive officer  within days prior to the filing date of this report 
based upon that evaluation  our chief executive officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information required to be included in our periodic securities and exchange commission filings
