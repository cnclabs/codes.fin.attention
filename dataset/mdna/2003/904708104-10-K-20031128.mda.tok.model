item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates the company believes the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
there have been no changes in judgments or estimates that had a material effect on our condensed consolidated financial statements for the periods presented 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts the company recognizes revenue from rental operations in the period in which the services are provided 
direct sale revenue is recognized in the period in which the product is shipped 
judgments and estimates are used in determining the collectability of accounts receivable 
the company analyzes specific accounts receivable and historical bad debt experience  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and the age of outstanding balances when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
management judgments and estimates are used in connection with establishing the allowance in any accounting period 
changes in estimates are reflected in the period they become known 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of bad debt expense recognition for any given period if management makes different judgments or utilizes different estimates 
inventories and rental merchandise in service inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value  net of any reserve for excess and obsolete inventory 
judgments and estimates are used in determining the likelihood that new goods on hand can be sold to customers or used in rental operations 
historical inventory usage and current revenue trends are considered in estimating both excess and obsolete inventories 
if actual product demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
the company uses the last in  first out lifo method to value a significant portion of its inventories 
substantially all inventories represent finished goods 
rental merchandise in service is being amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated service lives of the merchandise  which range from to months

insurance the company self insures for certain obligations related to health  workers compensation  vehicles and general liability programs 
the company also purchases stop loss insurance policies to protect it from catastrophic losses 
judgments and estimates are used in determining the potential value associated with reported claims and for losses that have occurred  but have not been reported 
the company s estimates consider historical claim experience and other factors 
the company s liabilities are based on estimates  and  while the company believes that the accrual for loss is adequate  the ultimate liability may be in excess of or less than the amounts recorded 
changes in claim experience  the company s ability to settle claims or other estimates and judgments used by management could have a material impact on the amount and timing of expense for any period 
environmental and other contingencies the company is subject to legal proceedings and claims arising from the conduct of their business operations  including environmental matters  personal injury  customer contract matters  employment claims 
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require that a liability for contingencies be recorded when it is probable that a liability has occurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
significant judgment is required to determine the existence of a liability  as well as the amount to be recorded 
the company regularly consults with attorneys and outside consultants to ensure that all of the relevant facts and circumstances are considered  before a contingent liability is recorded 
the company records accruals for environmental and other contingencies based on enacted laws  regulatory orders or decrees  the company s estimates of costs  insurance proceeds  participation by other parties and the timing of payments  and the input of outside consultants and attorneys 
the estimated liability for environmental contingencies has been discounted using credit adjusted risk free rates of interest that range from approximately to over periods ranging from fifteen to thirty years 
the estimated current costs  net of legal settlements with insurance carriers  have been adjusted for the estimated impact of inflation at per year 
changes in enacted laws  regulatory orders or decrees  management s estimates of costs  insurance proceeds  participation by other parties and the timing of payments  and the input of outside consultants and attorneys could have a material impact on the amounts recorded for environmental and other contingent liabilities

the company does not operate a hedging program to mitigate the effect of a significant rapid change in the value of the canadian dollar  euro or mexican peso as compared to the us dollar
