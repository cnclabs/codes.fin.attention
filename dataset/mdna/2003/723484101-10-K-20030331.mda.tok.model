throughout this item  we refer to specific notes in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
these notes add further details to the discussion 
business overview the company owns all of the outstanding common stock of aps 
aps is an electric utility that provides either retail or wholesale electric service to substantially all of the state of arizona  with the major exceptions of the tucson metropolitan area and about one half of the phoenix metropolitan area 
electricity is delivered through a distribution system owned by aps 
aps also generates  sells and delivers electricity to wholesale customers in the western united states 
the marketing and trading division sells  in the wholesale market  aps and pinnacle west energy generation output that is not needed for aps native load  which includes loads for retail customers and traditional cost of service wholesale customers 
aps does not distribute any products 
our other major subsidiaries are pinnacle west energy  through which we conduct our competitive electricity generation operations  aps energy services  which provides competitive commodity related energy services such as direct access commodity contracts  energy procurement and energy supply consultation and energy related products and services such as energy master planning  energy use consultation and facility audits  cogeneration analysis and installation and project management to commercial  industrial and institutional retail customers in the western united states  suncor  a developer of residential  commercial and industrial real estate projects in arizona  new mexico and utah  and el dorado  which owns a majority interest in nac specializing in spent nuclear fuel technology and holds miscellaneous small investments  including interests in arizona community based ventures 
summary of key factors affecting our financial outlook we believe the following are among the key factors affecting our financial outlook the following acc regulatory matters aps million financing application  which the acc approved on march   the implementation of the acc mandated process by which aps must competitively procure energy  and aps general rate case to be filed in wholesale power market conditions in the western united states 
we discuss each of these  and other factors in detail below in the section entitled factors affecting our financial outlook 
earnings contributions by subsidiary and business segment we have three principal business segments determined by products  services and the regulatory environment our regulated electricity segment  which consists of regulated traditional retail and wholesale electricity businesses and related activities and includes electricity transmission  distribution and generation  our marketing and trading segment  which consists of our competitive energy business activities  including wholesale marketing and trading and aps energy services commodity related energy services  and our real estate segment  which consists of suncor s real estate development and investment activities

see note b consistent with aps october acc filing  aps entered into agreements with its affiliates to buy power 
the agreements reflected a price based on the fully dispatchable dedication of the pinnacle west energy generating assets to aps native load customers 
in  pinnacle west energy recorded a million pretax write off related to the cancellation of redhawk units and c aps energy services and el dorado s net income is primarily reported before income taxes 
the income tax expense or benefit for these subsidiaries is recorded at the parent company 
d we recorded a million after tax charge in for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for trading activities  for the early adoption of eitf  issues involved in accounting for derivative contracts held for trading purposes and contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities  as of october  see note e aps recorded a million after tax charge in for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for derivatives related to the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
see note see note for additional financial information regarding our business segments 
results of operations general throughout the following explanations of our results of operations  we refer to gross margin 
with respect to our regulated electricity segment and marketing and trading segment  gross margin refers to electric operating revenues less purchased power and fuel costs 
our real estate segment gross margin refers to real estate revenues less real estate operations costs of suncor 
other gross margin refers to other operating revenues less other operating expenses  which includes el dorado s investment in nac  which we began consolidating in our financial statements in july see note 
other gross margin also includes amounts related to aps energy services energy consulting services 
compared with our consolidated net income for the year ended december  was million compared with million for the prior year 
we recognized a million after tax charge in for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for trading activities for the early adoption of eitf on october  see note 
in  we recognized a million after tax charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for derivatives  as required by sfas no 
see note 
our income before accounting change for the year ended december  was million compared with million for the prior year 
the period to period comparison was lower due to lower earnings contributions from our marketing and trading activities  reflecting lower liquidity and lower price volatility in the wholesale power markets in the western united states  pretax losses of million related to our investment in nac  a million pretax write off related to the cancellation of redhawk units and  of which million was recorded in operations and maintenance expense and million was recorded in capitalized interest  and severance costs of approximately million pretax recorded in the second half of relating to a voluntary workforce reduction 
the above decreases were partially offset by increased earnings contributions from our regulated electricity activities  reflecting lower replacement power costs for power plant outages  retail customer growth and higher average usage per customer  partially offset by the effects of milder weather  retail electricity price decreases and higher costs for purchased power and gas due to higher hedged gas and power prices  and increased earnings contributions from real estate operations  primarily as a result of increased sales activities 
for additional details  see the following discussion 
the major factors that increased decreased income before accounting change were as follows dollars in millions increase decrease regulated electricity segment gross margin lower replacement power costs for plant outages due to lower market prices and fewer unplanned outages increased purchased power and fuel costs due to higher hedged gas and power prices  partially offset by improved hedge management  net of mark to market reversals higher retail sales volumes due to customer growth and higher average usage  excluding weather effects charges related to purchased power contracts with enron and its affiliates retail price reductions effective july  and july  effects of milder weather on retail sales miscellaneous factors  net net increase in regulated electricity segment gross margin marketing and trading segment gross margin decrease in generation sales other than native load due to lower market prices partially offset by higher sales volumes lower realized wholesale margins net of related mark to market reversals due to lower prices and volumes higher competitive retail sales in california by aps energy services write off of prior period mark to market value related to trading with enron and its affiliates lower mark to market reversals due to the adoption of eitf lower mark to market gains for future delivery due to lower market liquidity and lower price volatility net decrease in marketing and trading segment gross margin net decrease in regulated electricity and marketing and trading segments gross margins higher real estate segment gross margin primarily due to increased sales activities lower other gross margin primarily related to nac losses higher operations and maintenance expense related to a million write off of redhawk units and and severance costs of approximately million  partially offset by lower generation reliability costs higher taxes other than income taxes lower other income primarily due to a insurance recovery of environmental remediation costs higher net interest expense primarily due to higher debt balances and lower capitalized interest miscellaneous factors  net net decrease in income before income taxes lower income taxes primarily due to lower income net decrease in income before accounting change regulated electricity segment gross margin regulated electricity segment revenues related to our regulated retail and wholesale electricity businesses were million lower in the year ended december   compared with the prior year as a result of decreased revenues related to traditional wholesale sales as a result of lower sales volumes and lower prices million  decreased revenues related to retail load hedge management wholesale sales  primarily as a result of lower prices and lower sales volumes million  decreased retail revenues related to milder weather million  increased retail revenues related to customer growth and higher average usage  excluding weather effects million  decreased retail revenues related to reductions in retail electricity prices million  and other miscellaneous factors million net decrease 
regulated electricity segment purchased power and fuel costs were million lower in the year ended december   compared with the prior year as a result of decreased costs related to traditional wholesale sales as a result of lower sales volumes and lower prices million  decreased costs related to retail load hedge management wholesale sales  primarily as a result of lower prices and lower sales volumes million  increased costs related to higher prices for hedged natural gas and purchased power  net of mark to market reversals million  decreased costs related to the effects of milder weather on retail sales million  increased costs related to retail sales growth  excluding weather effects million  charges in related to purchased power contracts with enron and its affiliates million net decrease  decreased replacement power costs for power plant outages due to lower market prices and fewer unplanned outages million  and miscellaneous factors million net decrease 
marketing and trading segment gross margin marketing and trading segment revenues were million lower in the year ended december   compared with the prior year as a result of decreased revenues from generation sales other than native load primarily due to lower market prices partially offset by higher sales volumes million  lower realized wholesale revenues net of related mark to market reversals primarily due to lower prices partially offset by higher volumes million  increased revenues from higher competitive retail sales in california by aps energy services million  write off of prior period mark to market value related to trading with enron and its affiliates million increase  higher revenues related to the adoption of eitf million  and lower mark to market gains for future delivery primarily as a result of lower market liquidity and lower price volatility  resulting in lower volumes million 
marketing and trading segment purchased power and fuel costs were million lower in the year ended december   compared to the prior year as a result of decreased fuel costs related to generation sales other than native load primarily because of lower natural gas prices partially offset by higher sales volumes million  decreased purchased power costs related to other realized marketing activities in the current period primarily due to lower prices partially offset by higher volumes million  increased purchased power costs related to higher competitive retail sales in california by aps energy services million  and change in mark to market fuel costs for future delivery million increase 
other income statement items the increase in real estate segment gross margin of million was primarily due to increased sales activities 
the decrease in other gross margin of million was primarily due to losses on el dorado s investment in nac see further discussion in note 
these losses for totaled approximately million on a pretax basis and were primarily related to nac contracts with two customers million was recorded in other gross margin and million was recorded in other expense 
we believe we have reserved our exposure with respect to these contracts in all material respects and  as a result  we consider these charges to be non recurring 
the increase in operations and maintenance expense of million was due to a million write off related to the cancellation of redhawk units and  severance costs of million related to a voluntary workforce reduction and other costs of million  partially offset by lower costs related to generation reliability  plant outages and maintenance costs of million 
the increase in taxes other than income taxes of million is primarily due to increased property taxes on higher property balances 
other income decreased million primarily due to an insurance recovery recorded in related to environmental remediation costs and other costs see note 
other expense was comparable with the prior year primarily due to losses recorded related to el dorado s investment in nac of approximately million see further discussion in note  offset by million of lower miscellaneous non operating costs see note 
net interest expense increased million primarily because of higher debt balances related to our generation construction program and lower capitalized interest on our generation construction program due to completion of redhawk units and in mid compared with our consolidated net income for the year ended december  was million compared with million for the prior year 
in  we recognized a million after tax charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for derivatives  as required by sfas no 
see note 
our income before accounting change for the year ended december  was million compared with million for the prior year 
the period to period comparison benefited from strong marketing and trading results  including significant benefits recognized in the third quarter of from structured trading activities  and retail customer growth 
the above increases were partially offset by lower earnings contributions from our regulated electricity activities  reflecting higher purchased power and fuel costs  due in part to increased power plant maintenance  generation reliability measures and continuing retail electricity price decreases  and charges related to enron and its affiliates 
for additional details  see the following discussion 
the major factors that increased decreased income before accounting change were as follows dollars in millions increase decrease regulated electricity segment gross margin higher replacement power costs for plant outages related to higher market prices retail price reductions effective july  and july  charges related to purchased power contracts with enron and its affiliates a higher retail sales primarily related to customer growth miscellaneous revenues net decrease in regulated electricity segment gross margin marketing and trading segment gross margin increase from generation sales other than native load due to higher market prices higher realized wholesale margin net of related mark to market reversals change in prior period mark to market value related to trading with enron and its affiliates a increase in mark to market value related to future periods net increase in marketing and trading segment gross margin net increase in regulated electricity and marketing and trading segments gross margins decrease in real estate segment contributions higher operations and maintenance expense related to generation reliability program higher operations and maintenance expense related primarily to employee benefits  plant outage and maintenance and other costs lower net interest expense primarily due to higher capitalized interest higher other net expense net increase in income before income taxes higher income taxes primarily due to higher income net increase in income before accounting change a we recorded charges totaling million before income taxes for exposure to enron and its affiliates in the fourth quarter of regulated electricity segment gross margin regulated electricity segment revenues related to our regulated retail and wholesale electricity businesses were million higher in the year ended december  compared to the prior year as a result of decreased revenues related to other wholesale sales and miscellaneous revenues as a result of lower sales volumes million  increased retail revenues primarily related to higher sales volumes primarily due to customer growth million  and decreased retail revenues related to reductions in retail electricity prices million 
regulated electricity segment purchased power and fuel costs were million higher in the year ended december  compared to the prior year as a result of decreased costs related to other wholesale sales as a result of lower volumes million  higher replacement power costs primarily due to higher market prices and increased plant outages million  including costs of million related to a palo verde outage extension to replace fuel control element assemblies  higher costs related to retail sales volumes due to customer growth million  and charges related to purchased power contracts with enron and its affiliates million 
marketing and trading segment gross margin marketing and trading segment revenues were million higher in the year ended december  compared with the prior year as a result of increased revenues related to generation sales other than native load as a result of higher average market prices million  increased realized wholesale revenues net of related mark to market reversals primarily due to more transactions million  decreased prior period mark to market value related to trading with enron and its affiliates million  and increased mark to market value for future periods primarily as a result of more forward sales volumes million 
marketing and trading segment purchased power and fuel costs were million higher in the year ended december  compared to the prior year as a result of increased fuel costs related to generation sales other than native load as a result of higher fuel prices million  and increased purchased power and fuel costs net of related mark to market reversals primarily due to more transactions million 
other income statement items the decrease in real estate segment profits of million resulted primarily from reduced sales of land and homes by suncor 
the increase in operations and maintenance expenses of million primarily related to the generation summer reliability program the addition of generating capability to enhance reliability for the summer of million and increased employee benefit costs  plant outage and maintenance and other costs million 
the comparison reflects pinnacle west s million provision for our credit exposure related to the california energy situation  million of which was recorded in the fourth quarter of and million of which was recorded in the first quarter of net other expense increased million primarily because of a change in the market value of el dorado s investment in a technology related venture capital partnership in and other nonoperating costs partially offset by an insurance recovery of environmental remediation costs see note 
interest expense decreased by million primarily because of increased capitalized interest resulting from our generation construction plan partially offset with higher interest expense due to higher debt balances 
see regulatory matters settlement agreement in note for a discussion of the settlement agreement under which  among other things  aps agreed to five annual retail electricity price reductions of  with the last decrease to take effect july  liquidity and capital resources capital needs and resources capital expenditure requirements the following table summarizes the actual capital expenditures for the year ended december  and estimated capital expenditures for the next three years 
capital expenditures dollars in millions actual estimated aps delivery generation a other e subtotal pinnacle west energy a b suncor c other d total a as discussed below under factors affecting our financial outlook  as part of its general rate case  aps intends to seek rate base treatment of certain power plants in arizona currently owned by pinnacle west energy specifically  redhawk units and  west phoenix units and and saguaro unit 
b see note for further discussion of pinnacle west energy s generation construction program and capital resources and cash requirements pinnacle west energy below 
these amounts do not include an expected reimbursement in by snwa of about million  assuming snwa exercises its option to purchase a interest in the silverhawk project at that time 
c consists primarily of capital expenditures for land development and retail and office building construction reflected in the change in real estate investments in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
d primarily related to the parent company and aps energy services 
e the other amounts relate to capital expenditures for our marketing and trading segment 
these costs were in the parent company for delivery capital expenditures are comprised of t d infrastructure additions and upgrades  capital replacements  new customer construction and related information systems and facility costs 
examples of the types of projects included in the forecast include t d lines and substations  line extensions to new residential and commercial developments and upgrades to customer information systems 
in addition  aps began several major transmission projects in these projects are periodic in nature and are driven by strong regional customer growth 
aps expects to spend about million on major transmission projects during the to time frame  and these amounts are included in aps delivery in the table above 
generation capital expenditures are comprised of various improvements for aps existing fossil and nuclear plants and the replacement of palo verde steam generators 
examples of the types of projects included in this category are additions  upgrades and capital replacements of various power plant equipment such as turbines  boilers and environmental equipment 
generation also contains nuclear fuel expenditures of approximately million annually for to replacement of the steam generators in palo verde unit is presently scheduled for completion during the fall outage of the palo verde owners have approved the manufacture of two additional sets of steam generators 
we expect that these generators will be installed in units and in the to time frame 
our portion of steam generator expenditures for units  and is approximately million  which will be spent from through in through  million of the costs are included in the generation capital expenditures table above and would be funded with internally generated cash or external financings 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes actual contractual requirements for the year ended december  and estimated contractual commitments for the next five years and thereafter dollars in millions actual estimated there after long term debt payments aps  pinnacle west suncor el dorado total long term debt payments  capital lease payments operating lease payments purchase power and fuel commitments total contractual commitments  off balance sheet arrangements in january  the fasb issued fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin no 
requires that we consolidate a vie if we have a majority of the risk of loss from the vie s activities or we are entitled to receive a majority of the vie s residual returns or both 
a vie is a corporation  partnership  trust or any other legal structure that either does not have equity investors with voting rights or has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
fin no 
is effective immediately for any vie created after january  and is effective july  for vies created before february  in  aps entered into agreements with three separate spe lessors in order to sell and lease back interests in palo verde unit the leases are accounted for as operating leases in accordance with gaap 
see note for further information about the sale leaseback transactions 
based on our preliminary assessment of fin no 
 we do not believe we will be required to consolidate the palo verde spes 
however  we continue to evaluate the requirements of the new guidance to determine what impact  if any  it will have on our financial statements 
aps is also exposed to losses under the palo verde sale leaseback agreements upon the occurrence of certain events that aps does not consider to be reasonably likely to occur 
under certain circumstances for example  the nrc issuing specified violation orders with respect to palo verde or the occurrence of specified nuclear events  aps would be required to assume the debt associated with the transactions  make specified payments to the equity participants and take title to the leased unit interests  which  if appropriate  may be required to be written down in value 
if such an event had occurred as of december   aps would have been required to assume approximately million of debt and pay the equity participants approximately million 
guarantees we and certain of our subsidiaries have issued guarantees in support of our unregulated businesses 
we have also obtained surety bonds on behalf of aps energy services 
we have not recorded any liability on our consolidated balance sheets with respect to these obligations 
see note for additional information regarding guarantees 
credit ratings the ratings of securities of pinnacle west and aps as of march  are shown below and are considered to be investment grade ratings 
the ratings reflect the respective views of the rating agencies  from which an explanation of the significance of their ratings may be obtained 
there is no assurance that these ratings will continue for any given period of time 
the ratings may be revised or withdrawn entirely by the rating agencies  if  in their respective judgments  circumstances so warrant 
any downward revision or withdrawal may adversely affect the market price of pinnacle west s or aps securities and serve to increase those companies cost of and access to capital 
moody s standard poor s fitch pinnacle west senior unsecured baa bbb bbb commercial paper p a f aps senior secured a a a senior unsecured baa bbb bbb secured lease obligation bonds baa bbb bbb commercial paper p a f on november   standard poor s affirmed the aps debt ratings in the above chart  but lowered pinnacle west s senior unsecured debt rating from bbb to bbb because of the structural subordination of this debt as compared to the unsecured debt at aps 
on that same date  standard poor s lowered aps corporate credit rating from bbb to bbb and affirmed the bbb corporate credit rating of pinnacle west 
standard poor s assigned a stable outlook to the ratings 
all of pinnacle west s and aps credit ratings remain investment grade 
in december  fitch placed certain of our debt and that of aps on ratings watch negative 
the ratings watch affects our senior unsecured debt and commercial paper ratings 
it also affects all of aps debt ratings  with the exception of its commercial paper rating 
on december   moody s affirmed the ratings set forth above 
debt provisions pinnacle west s and aps significant debt covenants related to their respective financing arrangements include a debt to total capitalization ratio and an interest coverage test 
pinnacle west and aps are in compliance with such covenants and each anticipates it will continue to meet all the significant covenant requirement levels 
the ratio of debt to total capitalization cannot exceed for both the company and aps 
at december   the ratios are approximately and for the parent company and aps  respectively 
the provisions regarding interest coverage require a minimum cash coverage of two times the interest requirements for both the company and aps 
the coverages are approximately times for the parent company  times for the aps bank agreements and times for the aps mortgage indenture 
failure to comply with such covenant levels would result in an event of default which  generally speaking  would require the immediate repayment of the debt subject to the covenants 
neither pinnacle west s nor aps financing agreements contain ratings triggers that would result in an acceleration of the required interest and principal payments in the event of a ratings downgrade 
however  in the event of a ratings downgrade  pinnacle west and or aps may be subject to increased interest costs under certain financing agreements 
all of pinnacle west s bank agreements contain cross default provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these loan agreements if pinnacle west or aps were to default under other agreements 
all of aps bank agreements contain cross default provisions that would result in defaults and the potential acceleration of payment under these bank agreements if aps were to default under other agreements 
pinnacle west s and aps credit agreements generally contain provisions under which the lenders could refuse to advance loans in the event of a material adverse change in our financial condition or financial prospects 
pinnacle west parent company our primary cash needs are for dividends to our shareholders  equity infusions into our subsidiaries  primarily pinnacle west energy  and interest payments and optional and mandatory repayments of principal on our long term debt see the table above for our contractual requirements  including our debt repayment obligations  but excluding optional repayments 
on october   our board of directors increased the common stock dividend to an indicated annual rate of per share from per share  effective with the december  dividend payment 
the level of our common dividends and future dividend growth will be dependent on a number of factors including  but not limited to  payout ratio trends  free cash flow and financial market conditions 
our primary sources of cash are dividends from aps  external financings and cash distributions from our other subsidiaries  primarily suncor 
for the years through  total dividends from aps were million and total distributions from suncor were million 
for the year ended december   dividends from aps were approximately million and distributions from suncor were approximately million 
we expect suncor to make cash distributions to the parent company of million to million annually in through due to anticipated accelerated asset sales activity 
on december   we issued  shares of common stock  no par value  which resulted in net proceeds of million 
see note we have financed pinnacle west energy s generation construction program premised upon pinnacle west energy s receipt of aps generation assets by the end of on november   the acc approved aps request interim financing application to permit aps to a make short term advances to pinnacle west in the form of an inter affiliate line of credit in the amount of million  or b guarantee million of pinnacle west s short term debt  subject to certain conditions 
as of december   there were no borrowings outstanding under this financing arrangement

at december   we had about million of commercial paper outstanding and million of short term borrowings 
our long term debt including current maturities totaled million at december  in mid  we will need to refinance approximately million of parent company indebtedness  including a total of million we expect to borrow under an existing credit facility 
we expect that this indebtedness will be repaid through funds borrowed by pinnacle west energy from aps under the million financing arrangement recently approved by the acc 
as part of a multi employer pension plan sponsored by pinnacle west  we contribute at least the minimum amount required under irs regulations  but no more than the maximum tax deductible amount 
the minimum required funding takes into consideration the value of the fund assets and our pension obligation 
we elected to contribute cash to our pension plan in each of the last five years  our minimum required contributions during each of those years was zero 
specifically  we contributed million for  million for  million for  million for and million for aps and other subsidiaries fund their share of the pension contribution  of which aps represents approximately of the total funding amounts described above 
the assets in the plan are mostly domestic common stocks  bonds and real estate 
we currently forecast a pension contribution in of approximately million  all or part of which may be required 
if the fund performance continues to decline as a result of a continued decline in equity markets  larger contributions may be required in future years 
as a result of a change in irs guidance  we claimed a tax deduction related to an aps tax accounting method change on the federal consolidated income tax return 
the accelerated deduction has resulted in a million reduction in the current income tax liability 
in  we received an income tax refund of approximately million related to our federal consolidated income tax return 
aps aps capital requirements consist primarily of capital expenditures and optional and mandatory redemptions of long term debt 
see factors affecting our financial outlook regulatory matters below and note for discussion of the million financing arrangement between aps and pinnacle west energy recently approved by the acc 
see pinnacle west parent company above and note for discussion of a million financing arrangement between aps and pinnacle west 
aps pays for its capital requirements with cash from operations and  to the extent necessary  external financings 
aps has historically paid for its dividends to pinnacle west with cash from operations 
in  aps issued million in long term debt  refinanced million in long term debt and redeemed approximately million in long term debt see note 
on april   aps will redeem million of its first mortgage bonds 
aps outstanding debt was approximately billion at december  at december   aps had credit commitments from various banks totaling about million  which were available either to support the issuance of commercial paper or to be used as bank borrowings 
at december   aps had no outstanding commercial paper or bank borrowings 
although provisions in aps first mortgage bond indenture  articles of incorporation and acc financing orders establish maximum amounts of additional first mortgage bonds  debt and preferred stock that aps may issue  aps does not expect any of these provisions to limit its ability to meet its capital requirements 
pinnacle west energy the costs of pinnacle west energy s construction of generating capacity from through are expected to be about billion 
this does not reflect an expected reimbursement in by snwa of about million of pinnacle west energy s cumulative capital expenditures in the silverhawk project  assuming snwa exercises its option to purchase a interest in the project 
pinnacle west energy is currently funding its capital requirements through capital infusions from pinnacle west  which finances those infusions through debt and equity financings and internally generated cash 
see the capital expenditures table above for actual capital expenditures in and projected capital expenditures for the next three years 
see factors affecting our financial outlook regulatory matters below and note for discussion of the million

el dorado funded its cash requirements during the past three years  primarily for nac in  with cash infused by the parent company and with cash from operations 
el dorado expects minimal capital requirements over the next three years and intends to focus on prudently realizing the value of its existing investments 
el dorado s long term debt was approximately million at december  and it had no long term debt outstanding at december  el dorado s long term debt increased primarily due to its consolidation of nac for financial reporting purposes see notes and 
aps energy services cash requirements during the past three years were funded with cash infusions from the parent company 
aps energy services capital expenditures and other cash requirements are increasingly funded by operations  with some funding from cash infused by pinnacle west 
see the capital expenditures table above regarding aps energy services actual capital expenditures for and projected capital expenditures for the next three years 
critical accounting policies in preparing the financial statements in accordance with gaap  management must often make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period 
some of those judgments can be subjective and complex  and actual results could differ from those estimates 
we consider the following accounting policies to be our most critical because of the uncertainties  judgments and complexities of the underlying accounting standards and operations involved 
regulatory accounting regulatory accounting allows for the actions of regulators  such as the acc and the ferc  to be reflected in the financial statements 
their actions may cause us to capitalize costs that would otherwise be included as an expense in the current period by unregulated companies 
pensions and other postretirement benefit accounting changes in our actuarial assumptions used in calculating our pension and other postretirement benefit liability and expense can have a significant impact on our earnings and financial position 
the most relevant actuarial assumptions are the discount rate used to measure our liability and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets used to estimate earnings on invested funds over the long term 
derivative accounting derivative accounting requires evaluation of rules that are complex and subject to varying interpretations 
our evaluation of these rules  as they apply to our contracts  will determine whether we use accrual accounting or fair value mark to market accounting 
mark to market accounting requires that changes in fair value be recorded in earnings or  if certain hedge accounting criteria are met  in other comprehensive income 
mark to market accounting the market value of our derivative contracts is not always readily determinable 
in some cases  we use models and other valuation techniques to determine fair value 
the use of these models and valuation techniques sometimes requires subjective and complex judgment 
actual results could differ from the results estimated through application of these methods 
our marketing and trading portfolio consists of structured activities hedged with a portfolio of forward purchases that protects the economic value of the sales transactions 
see the discussion below for further details on our critical accounting policies 
regulatory accounting for our regulated operations  we prepare our financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
sfas no 
requires a cost based  rate regulated enterprise to reflect the impact of regulatory decisions in its financial statements 
as a result  we capitalize certain costs that would be included as expense in the current period by unregulated companies 
regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery in customer rates 
regulatory liabilities generally represent obligations to make refunds to customers for previous collections of costs not likely to be incurred 
we are required to discontinue applying sfas no 
when deregulatory legislation is passed or a rate order is issued that contains sufficient detail to determine its effect on the portion of the business being deregulated 
in  we discontinued the application of sfas no 
for aps generation operations due to the settlement agreement with the acc 
see note for a discussion of the settlement agreement 
in  the acc directed aps not to transfer its generation assets  as previously required by the settlement agreement see track a order in note 
accordingly  we now consider aps generation to be cost based  rate regulated and subject to the requirements of sfas no 
the impact of this change was immaterial to our consolidated financial statements 
management continually assesses whether our regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory environment changes and recent rate orders to other regulated entities in the same jurisdiction 
this determination reflects the current political and regulatory climate in the state and is subject to change in the future 
if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable  the assets would be written off as a charge to current period earnings 
we had million of regulatory assets included on the consolidated balance sheets at december  see notes and for more information 
pensions and other postretirement benefit accounting we sponsor a qualified defined benefit pension plan and a non qualified supplemental excess benefit retirement plan for our employees and employees of our subsidiaries 
our reported costs of providing defined pension and other postretirement benefits are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience 
pension and other postretirement benefit costs  for example  are impacted by actual employee demographics including age  compensation levels and employment periods  the level of contributions we make to the plans and earnings on plan assets 
changes made to the provisions of the plans may also impact current and future pension and other postretirement benefit costs 
pension and other postretirement benefit costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions  including the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the projected benefit obligation and pension and other postretirement benefit costs 
pinnacle west s pension and other postretirement plan assets are primarily made up of equity and fixed income investments 
fluctuations in actual equity market returns as well as changes in general interest rates may result in increased or decreased pension and other postretirement benefit costs in future periods 
likewise  changes in assumptions regarding current discount rates and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets could also increase or decrease recorded pension and other postretirement benefit costs 
we account for our defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  which requires amounts recognized in our financial statements to be determined on an actuarial basis 
changes in pension obligations associated with these factors may not be immediately recognized as pension costs on the income statement  but generally are recognized in future years over the remaining average service period of plan participants 
as such  significant portions of pension costs recorded in any period may not reflect the actual level of cash benefits provided to plan participants 
the following chart reflects the sensitivities associated with a one percent increase or decrease in certain actuarial assumptions related to our defined benefit pension plans 
each sensitivity below reflects the impact of changing only that assumption 
the chart shows the increase decrease each change in assumption would have on the projected benefit obligation  our reported pension liability on the consolidated balance sheets and our reported annual pension expense  after consideration of amounts capitalized or billed to electric plant participants  on the consolidated statements of income dollars in millions 
increase decrease impact on projected impact on impact on benefit pension pension actuarial assumption obligation liability expense discount rate increase decrease expected long term rate of return on plan assets increase decrease at the end of each year  we determine the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of plan liabilities 
the discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
the discount rate is selected by comparison to current yields on high quality  long term bonds 
we changed our discount rate assumption from at december  to at december  in  we assumed that the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would be 
however  the plan assets have earned a rate of return substantially less than in the last three years due to sharp declines in the equity markets 
for  we decreased our expected long term rate of return on plan assets to  as a result of continued declines in general equity and bond market returns 
the following chart reflects the sensitivities associated with a one percent increase or decrease in certain actuarial assumptions related to our other postretirement benefit plans 
each sensitivity below reflects the impact of changing only that assumption 
the chart shows the increase decrease each change in assumption would have on the accumulated other postretirement benefit obligation and our reported other postretirement benefit expense  after consideration of amounts capitalized or billed to electric plant participants  on the consolidated statements of income dollars in millions

the discount rate is selected by comparison to current yields on high quality  long term bonds 
we changed our discount rate assumption from at december  to at december  in selecting our health care cost trend rate  we consider past performance and forecasts of health care costs 
in  we increased our initial health care cost trend rate to from based on an analysis of our actual plan experience 
we also assume an ultimate health care cost trend rate of is reached in in selecting the pretax expected long term rate of return on plan assets  we consider past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plan 
the market value of the plan assets has been affected by sharp declines in the equity markets 
for  we decreased our pretax expected long term rate of return on plan assets from to  as a result of continued declines in general equity and bond market returns 
pension and other postretirement benefit costs and cash funding requirements may increase in future years without a substantial recovery in the equity markets 
due to the actual investment performance of our pension and other postretirement benefit funds and the changes in the actuarial assumptions discussed above  we expect an increase of approximately million before income taxes in expense over see note for further details about our pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
derivative accounting we are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price and transportation costs of electricity  natural gas  coal and emissions allowances 
we manage risks associated with these market fluctuations by utilizing various commodity derivatives  including exchange traded futures and options and over the counter forwards  options and swaps 
as part of our risk management program  we enter into derivative transactions to hedge purchases and sales of electricity  fuels and emissions allowances and credits 
the changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the hedged commodities 
in addition  subject to specified risk parameters monitored by the ermc  we engage in marketing and trading activities intended to profit from market price movements 
we examine contracts at inception to determine the appropriate accounting treatment 
if a contract does not meet the derivative criteria or if it qualifies for a sfas no 
scope exception  we account for the contract on an accrual basis with associated revenues and costs recorded at the time the contracted commodities are delivered or received 
sfas no 
provides a scope exception for contracts that meet the normal purchases and sales criteria specified in the standard 
most of our non trading electricity purchase and sales agreements qualify as normal purchases and sales and are exempted from recognition in the financial statements until the electricity is delivered 
for contracts that qualify as a derivative and do not meet a sfas no 
scope exception  we further examine the contract to determine if it will qualify for hedge accounting 
changes in the fair value of the effective portion of derivative instruments that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment are recognized as either an asset or liability and in common stock equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
gains and losses related to derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges of expected transactions are recognized in revenue or purchased power and fuel expense as an offset to the related item being hedged when the underlying hedged physical transaction impacts earnings 
if a contract does not meet the hedging criteria in sfas no 
 we recognize the changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument in income each period through mark to market accounting 
on october   we adopted eitf  which rescinded eitf as a result  our energy trading contracts that are derivatives continue to be accounted for at fair value under sfas no 
contracts that were previously marked to market as trading activities under eitf that do not meet the accounting definition of a derivative are now accounted for on an accrual basis with the associated revenues and costs recorded at the time the contracted commodities are delivered or received 
additionally  all gains and losses realized and unrealized on energy trading contracts that qualify as derivatives are included in marketing and trading segment revenues on the consolidated statements of income on a net basis 
the rescission of eitf has no effect on the accounting for derivative instruments used for non trading activities  which continue to be accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
see other accounting matters accounting for derivative and trading activities below for details on the change in accounting for energy trading contracts 
see note for further discussion on derivative accounting 
mark to market accounting under mark to market accounting  the purchase or sale of energy commodities is reflected at fair market value  net of valuation adjustments  with resulting unrealized gains and losses recorded as assets and liabilities from risk management and trading activities in the consolidated balance sheets 
we determine fair market value using actively quoted prices when available 
we consider quotes for exchange traded contracts and over the counter quotes obtained from independent brokers to be actively quoted 
when actively quoted prices are not available  we use prices provided by other external sources 
this includes quarterly and calendar year quotes from independent brokers 
we shape quarterly and calendar year quotes into monthly prices based on historical relationships 
for options  long term contracts and other contracts for which price quotes are not available  we use models and other valuation methods 
the valuation models we employ utilize spot prices  forward prices  historical market data and other factors to forecast future prices 
the primary valuation technique we use to calculate the fair value of contracts where price quotes are not available is based on the extrapolation of forward pricing curves using observable market data for more liquid delivery points in the same region and actual transactions at the more illiquid delivery points 
we also value option contracts using a variation of the black scholes option pricing model 
for non exchange traded contracts  we calculate fair market value based on the average of the bid and offer price  and we discount to reflect net present value 
we maintain certain valuation adjustments for a number of risks associated with the valuation of future commitments 
these include valuation adjustments for liquidity and credit risks based on the financial condition of counterparties 
the liquidity valuation adjustment represents the cost that would be incurred if all unmatched positions were closed out or hedged 
a credit valuation adjustment is also recorded to represent estimated credit losses on our overall exposure to counterparties  taking into account netting arrangements  expected default experience for the credit rating of the counterparties  and the overall diversification of the portfolio 
counterparties in the portfolio consist principally of major energy companies  municipalities and local distribution companies 
we maintain credit policies that management believes minimize overall credit risk 
determination of the credit quality of counterparties is based upon a number of factors  including credit ratings  financial condition  project economics and collateral requirements 
when applicable  we employ standardized agreements that allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty 
see factors affecting our financial outlook market risks commodity price risk below and note for further discussion on credit risk 
the use of models and other valuation methods to determine fair market value often requires subjective and complex judgment 
actual results could differ from the results estimated through application of these methods 
our marketing and trading portfolio includes structured activities hedged with a portfolio of forward purchases that protects the economic value of the sales transactions 
to illustrate  as presented in the factors affecting our financial outlook market risks commodity price risk section below  a increase in the price of trading commodities would result in only a million decrease in pretax income 
our practice is to hedge within timeframes established by the ermc 
other accounting matters accounting for derivative and trading activities during  the eitf discussed eitf and reached a consensus on certain issues 
eitf rescinded eitf and was effective october  for any new contracts  and on january  for existing contracts  with early adoption permitted 
we adopted the eitf guidance for all contracts in the fourth quarter of we recorded a million after tax charge in net income as a cumulative effect adjustment for the previously recorded accumulated unrealized mark to market on energy trading contracts that did not meet the accounting definition of a derivative 
as a result  our energy trading contracts that are derivatives continue to be accounted for at fair value under sfas no 
contracts that were previously marked to market as trading activities under eitf that do not meet the definition of a derivative are now accounted for on an accrual basis with the associated revenues and costs recorded at the time the contracted commodities are delivered or received 
additionally  all gains and losses realized and unrealized on energy trading contracts that qualify as derivatives are included in marketing and trading segment revenues on the consolidated statements of income on a net basis 
the rescission of eitf has no effect on the accounting for derivative instruments used for non trading activities  which continue to be accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
eitf requires that derivatives held for trading purposes  whether settled financially or physically  be reported in the income statement on a net basis 
previous guidance under eitf permitted physically settled energy trading contracts to be reported either gross or net in the income statement 
beginning in the third quarter of  we netted all of our energy trading activities on the consolidated statements of income and restated prior year amounts for all periods presented 
reclassification of such trading activity to a net basis of reporting resulted in reductions in both revenues and purchased power and fuel costs  but did not have any impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in  we adopted sfas no 
and recorded a million after tax charge in net income and a million after tax credit in common stock equity as a component of other comprehensive income  both as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting for derivatives 
see notes and for further information on accounting for derivatives under sfas no 
asset retirement obligations on january  we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
the standard requires the fair value of asset retirement obligations to be recorded as a liability  along with an offsetting plant asset  when the obligation is incurred 
accretion of the liability due to the passage of time will be an operating expense and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the long lived asset 
see note for more information regarding our previous accounting for removal costs 
we determined that we have asset retirement obligations for our nuclear facilities nuclear decommissioning and certain other generation  transmission and distribution assets 
on january  we recorded a liability of million for our asset retirement obligations including the accretion impacts  a million increase in the carrying amount of the associated assets  and a net reduction of million in accumulated depreciation related primarily to the reversal of previously recorded accumulated decommissioning and other removal costs related to these obligations 
additionally  we recorded a regulatory liability of million for our asset retirement obligations related to our regulated utility 
this regulatory liability represents the difference between the amount currently being recovered in regulated rates and the amount calculated under sfas no 
we believe we can recover in regulated rates the transition costs and ongoing current period costs calculated in accordance with sfas no 
stock based compensation in the third quarter of  we began applying the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation  as provided for in sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
we recorded approximately  in stock option expense before income taxes in our consolidated statements of income for see notes and for further information on the impacts of adopting the fair value method provided in sfas no

factors affecting our financial outlook regulatory matters general on september   the acc approved rules that provide a framework for the introduction of retail electric competition in arizona 
on september   the acc approved a comprehensive settlement agreement among aps and various parties related to the implementation of retail electric competition in arizona 
under the rules  as modified by the settlement agreement  aps was required to transfer all of its competitive electric assets and services to an unaffiliated party or parties or to a separate corporate affiliate or affiliates no later than december  consistent with that requirement  aps had been addressing the legal and regulatory requirements necessary to complete the transfer of its generation assets to pinnacle west energy on or before that date 
on september   the acc issued the track a order  which  among other things  directed aps not to transfer its generation assets to pinnacle west energy 
settlement agreement the settlement agreement has affected  and will affect  our results of operations 
as part of the settlement agreement  aps agreed to reduce retail electricity prices for standard offer  full service customers with loads less than three megawatts in a series of annual decreases of on july  through july   for a total of 
for customers with loads three megawatts or greater  standard offer rates were reduced in annual increments totaling in the years through the settlement agreement also removed  as a regulatory disallowance  million before income taxes million net present value from ongoing regulatory cash flows 
aps recorded this regulatory disallowance as a net reduction of regulatory assets and reported it as a million after tax extraordinary charge on the consolidated statement of income 
as discussed under aps general rate case below  aps intends to seek recovery of this million write off in its next general rate case 
prior to the settlement agreement  the acc accelerated the amortization of substantially all of aps regulatory assets to an eight year period that would have ended june  the regulatory assets to be recovered under the settlement agreement are currently being amortized as follows dollars in millions total see note for additional information regarding the settlement agreement 
aps financing application on september   aps filed an application with the acc requesting the acc to allow aps to borrow up to million and to lend the proceeds to pinnacle west energy or to the company  to guarantee up to million of pinnacle west energy s or the company s debt  or a combination of both  not to exceed million in the aggregate 
in its application  aps stated that the acc s reversal of the generation asset transfer requirement and the resulting bifurcation of generation assets between aps and pinnacle west energy under different regulatory regimes result in pinnacle west energy being unable to attain investment grade credit ratings 
this  in turn  precludes pinnacle west energy from accessing capital markets to refinance the bridge financing that we provided to fund the construction of pinnacle west energy generation assets or from effectively competing in the wholesale markets 
on march   the acc authorized aps to lend up to million to pinnacle west energy  guarantee up to million of pinnacle west energy debt  or a combination of both  not to exceed million in the aggregate 
see acc applications in note for further discussion of the approval and related conditions 
track a order on september   the acc issued the track a order 
see track a order in note competitive procurement process on september   the acc issued an order that  among other things  established a requirement that aps competitively procure certain power requirements 
on march   the acc issued the track b order  which documented the decision made by the acc at its open meeting on february  addressing this requirement 
under the acc s track b order  aps will be required to solicit bids for certain estimated capacity and energy requirements for periods beginning july  for  aps will be required to solicit competitive bids for about  mw of capacity and about  gigawatt hours of energy  or approximately of aps total retail energy requirements 
the bid amounts are expected to increase in and based largely on growth in aps retail load and aps retail energy sales 
the track b order also confirmed that it was not intended to change the current rate base status of 
aps 
existing assets 
the order recognizes aps right to reject any bids that are unreasonable  uneconomical or unreliable 
aps expects to issue requests for proposals in march and to complete the selection process by june  pinnacle west energy will be eligible to bid to supply aps electricity requirements 
see track b order in note for additional information 
aps general rate case as required by the settlement agreement  on or before june   aps will file a general rate case with the acc 
in this rate case  aps will update its cost of service and rate design 
in addition  aps expects to seek rate base treatment of certain power plants currently owned by pinnacle west energy specifically  redhawk units and  west phoenix units and and saguaro unit  recovery of the million pretax asset write off recorded by aps as part of the settlement agreement million extraordinary charge recorded on the consolidated statement of income  and recovery of costs incurred by aps in preparation for the previously required transfer of generation assets to pinnacle west energy 
we assume that the acc will make a decision in this general rate case by the end of wholesale power market conditions the marketing and trading division  which we moved to aps in early for future marketing and trading activities existing wholesale contracts will remain at pinnacle west as a result of the acc s track a order prohibiting aps transfer of generating assets to pinnacle west energy  focuses primarily on managing aps purchased power and fuel risks in connection with its costs of serving retail customer demand 
additionally  the marketing and trading division  subject to specified parameters  markets  hedges and trades in electricity  fuels and emission allowances and credits 
earnings contributions from our marketing and trading division were lower in compared to due to weak wholesale power market conditions in the western united states  which included a lack of market liquidity  fewer creditworthy counterparties  lower wholesale market prices and resulting decreases in sales volumes 
our earnings will be affected by the strength or weakness of the wholesale power market 
generation construction see capital needs and resources pinnacle west energy above and note for information regarding pinnacle west energy s generation construction program 
the planned additional generation is expected to increase revenues  fuel expenses  operating expenses and financing costs 
factors affecting operating revenues general electric operating revenues are derived from sales of electricity in regulated retail markets in arizona and from competitive retail and wholesale bulk power markets in the western united states 
these revenues are expected to be affected by electricity sales volumes related to customer mix  customer growth and average usage per customer as well as electricity prices and variations in weather from period to period 
competitive sales of energy and energy related products and services are made by aps energy services in western states that have opened to competitive supply 
customer growth customer growth in aps service territory averaged about a year for the three years through  we currently expect customer growth to average about per year from to we currently estimate that retail electricity sales in kilowatt hours will grow to a year in through  before the retail effects of weather variations 
the customer growth and sales growth referred to in this paragraph applies to energy delivery customers 
as previously noted  under the settlement agreement  we agreed to retail electricity price reductions of annually through july  see note 
other factors affecting future financial results purchased power and fuel costs purchased power and fuel costs are impacted by our electricity sales volumes  existing contracts for purchased power and generation fuel  our power plant performance  prevailing market prices  new generating plants being placed in service and our hedging program for managing such costs 
operations and maintenance expenses operations and maintenance expenses are expected to be affected by sales mix and volumes  power plant additions and operations  inflation  outages  higher trending pension and other postretirement benefit costs and other factors 
in july  we implemented a voluntary workforce reduction as part of our cost reduction program 
we recorded million before taxes in voluntary severance costs in the second half of in addition  we are expecting to produce annual operating expense savings of approximately million beginning in as a result of this workforce reduction 
depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses are expected to be affected by net additions to existing utility plant and other property  changes in regulatory asset amortization and our generation construction program 
west phoenix unit was placed in service in june redhawk units and and the new saguaro unit began commercial operations in july west phoenix unit is expected to be on line in mid and silverhawk is expected to be in service in mid see note for further details about our generation construction program 
the regulatory assets to be recovered under the settlement agreement are currently being amortized as follows dollars in millions total property taxes taxes other than income taxes consist primarily of property taxes  which are affected by tax rates and the value of property in service and under construction 
the average property tax rate for aps  which currently owns the majority of our property  was of assessed value for and for we expect property taxes to increase primarily due to our generation construction program and our additions to existing facilities 
interest expense interest expense is affected by the amount of debt outstanding and the interest rates on that debt 
the primary factors affecting borrowing levels in the next several years are expected to be our capital requirements and our internally generated cash flow 
capitalized interest offsets a portion of interest expense while capital projects are under construction 
we stop recording capitalized interest on a project when it is placed in commercial operation 
as noted above  we have placed new power plants in commercial operation in and and we expect to bring additional plants on line in and we are continuing to evaluate our generation construction program 
interest expense is affected by interest rates on variable rate debt and interest rates on the refinancing of the company s future liquidity needs 
retail competition the regulatory developments and legal challenges to the rules discussed in note have raised considerable uncertainty about the status and pace of retail electric competition in arizona 
although some very limited retail competition existed in aps service area in and  there are currently no active retail competitors providing unbundled energy or other utility services to aps customers 
as a result  we cannot predict when  and the extent to which  additional competitors will re enter aps service territory 
subsidiaries in the case of suncor  we are undertaking an aggressive effort to accelerate asset sales activities to approximately double suncor s annual earnings in to compared to the million in earnings recorded in a portion of these sales could be reported as discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of income 
the annual earnings contribution from aps energy services is expected to be positive over the next several years due primarily to a number of retail electricity contracts in california 
aps energy services had pretax earnings of million in el dorado s historical results are not necessarily indicative of future performance for el dorado 
el dorado s strategies focus on prudently realizing the value of its existing investments 
general our financial results may be affected by a number of broad factors 
see forward looking statements below for further information on such factors  which may cause our actual future results to differ from those we currently seek or anticipate 
market risks our operations include managing market risks related to changes in interest rates  commodity prices and investments held by the nuclear decommissioning trust fund and our pension plans 
interest rate and equity risk our major financial market risk exposure is changing interest rates 
changing interest rates will affect interest paid on variable rate debt and interest earned by our pension plan see note and nuclear decommissioning trust fund see note 
our policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed rate and floating rate debt 
the pension plan and nuclear decommissioning fund also have risks associated with changing market values of equity investments 
pension aps only and nuclear decommissioning costs are recovered in regulated electricity prices

we manage risks associated with these market fluctuations by utilizing various commodity derivatives  including exchange traded futures and options and over the counter forwards  options and swaps 
the ermc  consisting of senior officers  oversees company wide energy risk management activities and monitors the results of marketing and trading activities to ensure compliance with our stated energy risk management and trading policies 
as part of our risk management program  we enter into derivative transactions to hedge purchases and sales of electricity  fuels and emissions allowances and credits 
the changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the hedged commodities 
in addition  subject to specified risk parameters monitored by the ermc  we engage in marketing and trading activities intended to profit from market price movements 
prior to october   we accounted for our energy trading contracts at fair value in accordance with eitf on october   we adopted eitf  which rescinded eitf as a result  our energy trading contracts that are derivatives continue to be accounted for at fair value under sfas no 
contracts that were previously marked to market as trading activities under eitf that do not meet the definition of a derivative are now accounted for on an accrual basis with the associated revenues and costs recorded at the time the contracted commodities are delivered or received 
additionally  all gains and losses realized and unrealized on energy trading contracts that qualify as derivatives are included in marketing and trading segment revenues on the consolidated statements of income on a net basis 
the rescission of eitf has no effect on the accounting for derivative instruments used for non trading activities  which continue to be accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
see note for details on the change in accounting for energy trading contracts and further discussion regarding derivative accounting 
both non trading and trading derivatives are classified as assets and liabilities from risk management and trading activities in the consolidated balance sheets 
for non trading derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting treatment  changes in the fair value of the effective portion are recognized in common stock equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
non trading derivatives  or any portion thereof  that are not effective hedges are adjusted to fair value through income 
gains and losses related to non trading derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges of expected transactions are recognized in revenue or purchased power and fuel expense as an offset to the related item being hedged when the underlying hedged physical transaction impacts earnings 
if it becomes probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur  we discontinue the use of hedge accounting and recognize in income the unrealized gains and losses that were previously recorded in other comprehensive income loss 
in the event a non trading derivative is terminated or settled  the unrealized gains and losses remain in other comprehensive income loss  and are recognized in income when the underlying transaction impacts earnings 
derivatives associated with trading activities are adjusted to fair value through income 
derivative commodity contracts for the physical delivery of purchase and sale quantities transacted in the normal course of business are exempt from the requirements of sfas no 
under the normal purchase and sales exception and are not reflected on the balance sheet at fair value 
most of our non trading electricity purchase and sales agreements qualify as normal purchases and sales and are exempted from recognition in the financial statements until the electricity is delivered 
our assets and liabilities from risk management and trading activities are presented in two categories consistent with our business segments system our regulated electricity business segment  which consists of non trading derivative instruments that hedge our purchases and sales of electricity and fuel for our native load requirements  and marketing and trading our non regulated  competitive business segment  which includes both non trading and trading derivative instruments

the impact of these hypothetical price movements would substantially offset the impact that these same price movements would have on the physical exposures being hedged 
credit risk we are exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance or nonpayment by counterparties 
we have risk management and trading contracts with many counterparties  including two counterparties for which a worst case exposure represents approximately of our million of risk management and trading assets as of december  our risk management process assesses and monitors the financial exposure of these and all other counterparties 
despite the fact that the great majority of trading counterparties are rated as investment grade by the credit rating agencies  including the counterparties noted above  there is still a possibility that one or more of these companies could default  resulting in a material impact on consolidated earnings for a given period 
counterparties in the portfolio consist principally of major energy companies  municipalities and local distribution companies 
we maintain credit policies that we believe minimize overall credit risk to within acceptable limits 
determination of the credit quality of our counterparties is based upon a number of factors  including credit ratings and our evaluation of their financial condition 
in many contracts  we employ collateral requirements and standardized agreements that allow for the netting of positive and negative exposures associated with a single counterparty 
valuation adjustments are established representing our estimated credit losses on our overall exposure to counterparties
