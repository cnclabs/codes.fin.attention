item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general mge energy  inc mge energy  through its principal subsidiary madison gas and electric company mge  operates in two business segments electric operations generate and distribute electricity to nearly  customers in dane county  wisconsin  which includes the city of madison 
mge contracts with american transmission company atc and others for transmission service 
gas operations purchase and distribute natural gas to more than  customers in seven wisconsin counties columbia  crawford  dane  iowa  juneau  monroe  and vernon 
mge also contracts with various pipelines for transporting natural gas 
mge energy became the holding company for mge on august   when shareholders exchanged each share of mge common stock for one share of mge energy common stock 
the share exchange had no accounting effect on mge s recorded assets  liabilities  revenues  or expenses 
mge s utility operations represent substantially all of the assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses of mge energy 
mge energy s nonutility operations  relating  principally  to the development of a cogeneration project on the madison campus of the university of wisconsin uw  are not significant at this time 
consequently  with the exception of the discussion under nonutility energy outlook under results of operations  the following discussion focuses on the results of operations and financial condition of mge 
the following discussion provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of mge energy and mge s consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes 
forward looking statements this report  and certain other mge energy and mge public documents  contain forward looking statements that reflect management s current assumptions and estimates regarding future performance and economic conditions especially as they relate to future revenues  expenses  financial resources  and regulatory matters 
these forward looking statements are made pursuant to the provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of mge energy cautions investors that forward looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause mge energy s actual results to differ materially from those projected  expressed  or implied 
some of those risks and uncertainties include weather economic and market conditions in mge s service territory 
magnitude and timing of capital expenditures 
regulatory environment including restructuring the electric utility industry in wisconsin 
availability and cost of power supplies 
mge energy and mge undertake no obligation to publicly release any revision to these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report 
results of operations mge energy earnings overview in  mge energy s earnings were million or per share 
mge s increase in electric retail sales and higher average rate per customer contributed to a increase in electric revenues 
purchased power costs increased substantially 
was the first full year mge purchased megawatts mw of capacity and energy to replace its share of generation lost from kewaunee 
mge sold its interest in kewaunee to wisconsin public service corporation wpsc in september as a result  mge s operations and maintenance costs were lower in mge s gas margin revenues less the cost of gas increased million due to growth in gas deliveries 
earnings in were million or per share 
electric revenues remained constant despite a third quarter pretax adjustment of approximately million  reducing electric unbilled revenues 
electric operating income was down due to increased fuel costs  transmission wheeling expenses paid to atc  and higher distribution expenses 
gas operating income decreased mainly because warm weather in the fourth quarter resulted in lower gas deliveries 
other income increased substantially due to mge s equity earnings in atc  gains on weather hedge instruments  and lower charitable contributions 
interest expense was down due to lower interest rates and less short term debt 
earnings in were million or per share 
electric operating income was up million due to increased sales and new generating facilities that earn a return for investors 
an increase in total gas deliveries added million to gas operating income 
two other factors contributed significantly to higher net income gains on some performance based natural gas incentives and lower pension costs due to strong performance in mge s plan assets 
mge electric sales and revenues in  electric retail sales rose due to warmer than normal summer temperatures 
total cooling degree days were up see table 
in  total retail sales were down because mge changed its estimated unbilled sales calculation in the third quarter of that year 
sales for resale were down in due to lower off peak sales during the first half of the year 
electric operating revenues were up million or in the higher revenues are attributed to customer growth and greater use per customer million 
an increase in electric rates million  footnote 
an increase in other electric revenues due in large part to a vendor settlement and a true up for the spring outage at kewaunee million 
a rise in sales for resale despite a drop in sales volume because electricity was sold at a higher rate per kilowatt hour million 
electric sales mw hours change residential   commercial   industrial   other   total retail   resale utilities   total sales   cooling degree days normal cooling degree days measure the extent to which the average daily temperature rises above degrees fahrenheit  increasing demand for cooling 
in  electric retail sales decreased despite warmer than normal summer temperatures 
in  total electric revenues remained the same  even though electric sales dropped slightly 
retail revenues were up million or 
these increases offset an approximate million reduction in the third quarter that resulted from a change in estimated unbilled revenues described below 
significant items affecting retail revenues included a electric rate increase effective january   combined with customer growth and greater use per customer million  net of the unbilled adjustment 
a kilowatt hour electric fuel surcharge effective may through september  million  see footnote 
the increase in retail revenues was offset by a million decrease in other electric revenues 
a million decrease in sales for resale because a contract expired with wisconsin public power inc mge sold mws of firm energy and capacity to wisconsin public power from march through september  as noted above  mge adjusted unbilled revenues in the third quarter of  reducing revenues by approximately million 
the adjustment was made after reviewing mge s assumptions regarding electricity lost in the process of transmission and distribution  or line loss 
prior to the adjustment  mge estimated line loss based on a computer modeled study performed in at times  the study has been reviewed for reasonableness and adjustments made  as needed 
an analysis of various operating and financial statistics in the third quarter of including the unbilled to billed sales ratio indicated the estimate for unbilled revenues needed adjusting 
mge s adjustment aligned the unbilled to billed ratio with the to range it would normally expect 
mge changed its method for incorporating unbilled consumption from prior periods into the calculation of amounts available for sale to customers during the current period 
the revised calculation determines unbilled quantities available for sale in the current month based on the current month and the trailing two months 
mge previously brought forward the unbilled quantity from prior months  which had the effect of cumulating any underestimated line loss amounts 
the three months is based on an assumption which mge believes is reasonable that all electricity consumed by all classes of customers is billed within three months 
mge also determined the ratio of unbilled to billed sales had a sufficient relationship to include that statistic in validating results of its estimation methodology 
this is in addition to the ratio between unbilled sales and accounts receivable that was previously used 
see footnote b for more information regarding the unbilled revenue estimation methodology 
mge gas sales and revenues in  retail gas deliveries increased due to colder weather during most of the heating season 
total heating degree days were up see table 
a larger customer base in southwestern wisconsin 
on december   mge purchased the prairie du chien area natural gas system from we energies for million 
mge gained approximately  residential and commercial customers in the prairie du chien area 
transport deliveries increased in as alternative fuel customers used more natural gas during the first half of the year 
in  transport sales declined as customers turned to other fuels when the price of natural gas hit record high levels 
despite growth in gas deliveries  retail gas revenues were down million or in due to lower gas costs 
the average rate for residential customers was per therm in compared to per therm in the following table shows total gas deliveries by customer class 
therms delivered in thousands change residential   commercial and industrial   total retail system   transport   total gas deliveries   heating degree days normal    heating degree days measure the extent to which the average daily temperature is below degrees fahrenheit  increasing demand for heating 
during  retail gas deliveries were down 
warmer weather in november and december resulted in lower gas use per customer 
the average temperature for november and december was degrees fahrenheit  warmer than the same period in transport deliveries were up primarily because customers who have the ability to switch fuels bought more gas to generate electricity or produce steam 
in  gas revenues increased million or 
revenues were up due to significantly higher gas costs during the first half of the year and a rate increase effective january  see footnote 
mge electric fuel and purchased power in  fuel used for electric generation decreased million or 
fuel costs for mge s electric generating units excluding columbia and kewaunee were down million or 
mge relied less on certain generating units because higher fuel costs made it generally cheaper to buy electricity than operate those units 
fuel costs for the columbia units increased million or due to higher coal costs 
nuclear fuel expense decreased million or since mge sold its ownership interest in kewaunee in in  purchased power expense increased million or 
mge purchased electric capacity and energy to replace the energy generation lost from selling its ownership interest in kewaunee and to meet expected load growth 
in june  mge exercised an option to buy mws of electric capacity and energy at a fixed price from wpsc from september   through september  increased purchased power costs in reduced mge s electric margin revenues less fuel and purchased power by million or 
in  fuel for electric generation increased million or 
fuel costs for mge s electric generating units were up primarily due to the increased use of base load power plants at a marginally higher fuel cost especially in the second quarter and the higher cost of natural gas used to generate electricity during the first half of the year 
mge customers set a record for peak demand mws on august  during  purchased power decreased million or 
this decrease is attributed to the following in the first three quarters of  mge did not need to buy additional capacity from outside sources because its base load units operated at full capacity 
in the second quarter of  mge purchased more expensive open market replacement power during a six week scheduled refueling and maintenance outage at kewaunee 
mge purchased only mws from commonwealth edison in compared to mws in the purchased power decreases described above were partially offset by the following mge executed its option to purchase mws of electric capacity and energy at a fixed price from wpsc from september   through september  this option was part of the kewaunee sale agreement between wpsc and mge see footnote 
electric margin revenues less fuel and purchased power decreased million or  in reflecting constant revenues and the higher fuel costs as previously described 
mge natural gas purchased in  natural gas purchased was down million or  primarily due to lower wellhead prices  on average 
natural gas prices cost per therm decreased more than in a purchased gas adjustment clause pga allows mge to pass along to customers the cost of gas  subject to certain limited incentives 
the pga is authorized by the pscw 
mge gas margin revenues less gas purchased increased million or in customer growth increased deliveries and a rate increase effective january   contributed to the rise in gas margins see footnote 
in  natural gas purchased increased million or  despite retail deliveries declining 
even though customer use was down due to the warmer than normal winter weather  the average cost per therm of natural gas was up over gas margins increased million or primarily due to a rate increase effective january  mge other operations and maintenance electric in  electric operating expense decreased million or 
the following changes contributed to lower electric operating expenses for the year 
mge sold its ownership interest in kewaunee to wpsc 
as a result  operating expenses declined million 
miscellaneous steam power expense decreased million or 
mge recovered through rates some carrying costs for actions taken at columbia to reduce nox emissions 
employee health and pension expenses increased million or  due to dramatically rising health care costs and lower investment returns on plan assets 
outside service expenses increased million primarily due to forming the holding company and participating in power the future 
miscellaneous steam power expenses for columbia increased million or as a result of increased administrative and general overheads million and employee pensions and benefits million 
transmission wheeling costs rose million or due to relying on more purchased power 
miscellaneous electric operating expenses increased million 
in  electric operating expense increased million or 
the following changes contributed to higher electric operating expense for the year 
increased transmission costs million 
mge started paying atc a wheeling charge on january  the wheeling charge is offset by equity earnings for mge s ownership interest in atc 
these equity earnings were recorded in other income 
nox accrual million 
the pscw authorized utilities to defer all project costs for complying with the federal us environmental protection agency s epa new requirements on nox emissions 
in its rate case docket ur  the pscw allowed mge to establish an escrow mechanism for these costs due to uncertainties regarding the amount and timing of nox emissions remediation expenditures 
the annual recovery allowed in rates is million  of which million is recorded in depreciation expense and million in operating expense 
increased miscellaneous distribution expenses million 
increases in electric operating expenses were offset somewhat by lower kewaunee operating expenses million due to three fewer months of expense after mge sold its ownership interest in the plant see footnote and lower overhead for administrative and general 
the pscw decreasing mge s energy conservation escrow amount million 
gas in  gas operating expense increased million or 
the following changes contributed to higher gas operating expenses for the year 
employee health and pension expenses increased million or due to dramatically rising health care costs and lower investment returns on plan assets 
other expenses increased million due to increased administrative and general expenses million  increased injuries and damages million  and other miscellaneous expenses million 
outside service expenses increased million or primarily due to forming the holding company 
uncollectible account expenses were down million or 
more customers paid their bills in as warmer than normal weather and lower priced natural gas in the first quarter significantly reduced utility bills 
in  gas operating expense increased million or 
uncollectible customer account balances were up due to significantly higher natural gas costs during the first half of the year million and increased administrative and billing expenses million 
maintenance expense in  electric maintenance expense was down million or 
it is the net result of the following two factors maintenance expenses declined million since mge sold its ownership interest in kewaunee to wpsc 
maintenance expenses at columbia increased as a result of a scheduled seven week outage during april and may million 
in  electric maintenance expense was down million or primarily due to three fewer months of expense at kewaunee after mge sold its ownership interest in the plant see footnote combined with lower maintenance expense compared to million 
lower maintenance expense at columbia million 
depreciation in  depreciation expense decreased million or 
electric depreciation decreased million 
the decrease is attributed to reduced decommissioning expense million  the sale of kewaunee assets million  see footnote  and offset by increased depreciation expense for the addition of electric assets million 
gas depreciation expense increased because mge added plant assets million 
in  depreciation expense increased million or 
electric depreciation expense increased million 
the change in depreciation expense is attributed to increased earnings on the decommissioning trust fund million  a nox accrual million  the addition of electric assets million  and somewhat offset by reduced transmission depreciation million  see footnote and the transfer of assets related to the kewaunee sale million 
there were no significant changes to gas depreciation in other general taxes other general taxes  consisting mainly of the wisconsin license fee tax and payroll taxes  were consistent between and income taxes the effective income tax rate increased to from for and for due to a combination of reasons 
the increase in tax rate is partly attributable to lower amounts of amortized tax benefits from excess deferred income taxes and deferred investment tax credit 
these lower amortized tax benefits are the result of mge s investment in atc and the sale of its interest in kewaunee  both transactions 
in compared to  amortized excess deferred income taxes and amortized investment tax credits have decreased by a total of million 
in  mge recorded a net deferred tax expense of million to fully accrue its deferred tax liability for utility property 
mge is evaluating its ability to recover these taxes in rates 
on august   mge energy became the holding company for mge and other subsidiaries 
certain one time intercompany transactions for state tax purposes and costs of capital associated with forming mge energy have resulted in permanent differences between financial and income tax reporting and have increased the state tax component of the effective income tax rate 
other nonoperating items in  other income decreased million or 
the decrease in other income is attributed to the following mge transferred its qualified decommissioning fund million  fair market value and nonqualified decommissioning fund million  fair market value to wpsc with the sale of its ownership interest in kewaunee footnote 
there was no impact on earnings 
the lower decommissioning earnings on trust assets were offset by an equal decrease in accumulated depreciation expense 
the related decrease in other income was million 
an increase in charitable contributions reduced other income by million 
during  mge did not benefit from a gain on a weather hedge 
in  mge received a million pretax gain from weather hedge instruments 
the net effect was a million decrease in other income in in  other income increased million primarily due to million equity earnings in atc see footnote 
a million gain from weather hedge instruments 
a million increase in earnings on the decommissioning funds 
a million reduction in charitable contributions 
in  other income decreased million 
mge donated million to the mge innovation center and the mge foundation 
these donations provide substantial benefits to the community and mge s service territory 
other income was also down because there was a gain from mge s gas marketing subsidiaries in and not in earnings on the decommissioning fund were up million in interest expense in  interest expense decreased million or 
lower rates on mge s million variable rate debt which matured on may  reduced interest expense by million 
lower short term debt levels in the first quarter  coupled with significantly lower interest rates  reduced other interest expense by million 
in  total interest decreased million or 
lower short term debt  due to proceeds received from atc and the sale of kewaunee  caused the decline in other interest expense of million 
in addition  mge redeemed million of its  series  pollution control revenue bonds  at par on november  in  total interest increased million or 
compared to  mge had higher levels of short term debt and interest on million in new long term debt million issued on may   and million issued on september  
mge electric and gas operations outlook mge anticipates electric and gas sales will grow at a compounded rate of to through peak demand will grow an estimated each year through mge expects to maintain a competitive advantage because of its service territory  which has one of the strongest economies in the nation 
it is distinguished by consistent growth  high employment and wages  and a diversified base of business  industry  government  and education 
competitive distribution costs  low percentage of industrial customers  and lower risk of stranded investments 
size and agility  which allow employees to respond quickly and offer more flexibility as customers needs change 
mge sold its ownership interest in kewaunee in the fall of this will help eliminate the risk of future stranded investment 
the capacity lost from kewaunee will be replaced with purchased power contracts 
the pscw has focused on improving the infrastructure needed in wisconsin to ensure reliable service for consumers 
mge invests in new facilities to meet its customers needs 
it also advocates statewide solutions that will keep pace with the growing demand for energy 
nonutility energy outlook mge energy s primary focus is its core utility customers 
the holding company structure will facilitate competitive new electric generation projects 
it will also allow financial returns from these projects to be retained for the benefit of mge s system and mge energy s shareholders 
mge energy s nonutility energy operations will be conducted through its subsidiaries  mge construct  llc  and mge power  llc 
both were formed in to construct and own new generating capacity 
it is expected that  subject to pscw approval in each instance  mge power will lease back new generating facilities to mge under regulated  long term lease agreements 
power the future generation on february   mge secured an option to own a portion of the advanced technology  coal fired  base load generation proposed in we energies power the future plan 
the plan includes three new mw coal fired plants  which would be located in wisconsin 
the plan is subject to pending regulatory proceedings 
we energies filed its certificate of public convenience and necessity cpcn proposal with the pscw in early a pscw decision is expected on the plan in pursuant to an amended agreement reached on january   mge has the option to acquire an undivided under certain conditions ownership interest in each of the proposed coal plants  up to a total of mws for all three plants 
if these options are fully exercised  that exercise would require an estimated million to million investment over ten years 
west campus cogeneration facility wccf mge energy  through mge power and mge construct  has assumed responsibility from mge for the construction and ownership of a proposed natural gas fired cogeneration facility to be built on the madison campus of the uw 
as planned  the facility would have  tons of chilled water capacity   pounds per hour of steam capacity  and approximately mws of electricity capacity 
the facility would be jointly owned by the state of wisconsin  the uw  and mge power and would be leased and operated by mge 
the state and the uw would own a controlling interest in the chilled water and steam plants  which would be used to meet the growing uw need for air conditioning and steam heat capacity 
mge power would own a controlling interest in the electric generation plant  which would be used to provide electricity to mge s customers 
mge construct would be responsible for the construction of the facility 
the ownership  construction  and operation of the facility requires various state approvals as well as the completion of definitive agreements  including a construction agreement 
as part of this process  the state is reviewing its alternatives before entering final agreements 
depending on the approval process  construction could start in  with the facility coming on line in mge also requires pscw approval in order to lease and operate the facility 
on october   the pscw deemed mge s cpcn application complete 
a pscw decision is expected on mge s participation in the facility during the facility is expected to cost approximately million 
on november   the state paid million to mge for its share of those costs under a september pre certification cost sharing agreement between mge and the state 
on december   mge power reimbursed mge for the remainder of those costs as a part of mge power s assumption of the project 
as of december   mge power had incurred million of costs on the project  which is reflected as construction work in progress on mge energy s consolidated balance sheets 
these costs largely represent amounts paid under long lead time equipment contracts in order to meet project schedules  although  as noted  several approvals remain outstanding 
a failure to obtain these approvals could terminate the project and could result in the write off of these costs to the extent that the associated equipment and efforts cannot be put to alternative uses 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows the following summarizes mge energy s cash flows during   and thousands of dollars cash provided by used for operating activities investing activities financing activities cash provided by operating activities for mge energy in  cash provided by operating activities decreased million or 
working capital current assets less current liabilities decreased million primarily due to an increase in customer payables 
mge deposited million in an escrow account and granted atc a security interest in the collateral 
atc will provide system upgrades for mge in conjunction with the wccf proposed on the uw madison campus 
the collateral account complies with the interconnection agreement between atc and mge dated november  depreciation and other amortization expenses decreased million  mainly because mge sold its ownership interest in kewaunee 
deferred income taxes for decreased million compared to the significantly larger deferred tax expense in was attributable to the sale of kewaunee  which resulted in reversal of temporary differences associated with the plant and decommissioning funds 
in  cash provided by operating activities increased million or 
decreases in customer receivables million and unbilled revenues million were offset by higher stored gas inventories of million and a million reduction in accounts payable 
deferred income taxes increased in due to the sale of kewaunee 
capital requirements and investing activities for mge energy in  cash used for investing activities increased million 
utility plant additions were up million due to installing an automated meter reading amr system  installing nox emissions equipment at columbia  and upgrading mge substations to improve reliability 
capital expenditures related to the wccf totaled million 
in  mge received a million capital distribution from atc and million for selling its interest in kewaunee 
in  mge s cash used for investing activities was down million or mainly because of a significant decrease in plant additions 
in  mge paid million for an mw gas fired combustion turbine 
mge also received a capital distribution of million from atc for debt repayment and a cash payment of million from the sale of kewaunee see footnote mge energy s and mge s liquidity are primarily affected by their construction requirements 
capital expenditures in totaled million  which included million of capital commitments for the wccf 
mge s capital requirements were higher in due to installing an amr system million  upgrading mge substations to improve reliability million  and installing nox emissions equipment at columbia million 
mge anticipates capital expenditures will be million and include substation improvements million  amr project costs million  and upgrading its energy management system million 
capital expenditures for through will average an estimated million per year excluding the wccf and mge s option to purchase a portion of power the future coal plants 
the following table shows mge s estimated expenditures for  actual for  and the three year average for to capital expenditures including nuclear fuel in thousands for the years ended december estimated actual three year average to electric production    transmission  distribution and general    nuclear fuel  total electric    gas    common    total    in  mge used internally generated funds and short term debt to satisfy most of its capital requirements 
for the larger capital investments  mge issues additional long term debt and common stock 
mge energy used existing lines of credit to satisfy capital commitments related to the wccf 
financing activities and capitalization matters for mge energy in  cash provided by financing activities was million 
short term debt increased million 
two long term debt issues occurred in the fourth quarter of a million issue replaced the million in debt that matured in may  which was rolled into short term debt at that time 
another million issue financed capital expenditures for the amr project  which had been financed with short term debt 
mge energy s capitalization ratios were as follows capital structure ratios common shareholders equity long term debt short term debt does not include accumulated other comprehensive loss  includes current maturities 
in  cash used for financing activities was million as mge reduced its short term debt by million 
mge reduced short term debt and redeemed million in long term debt by using the cash distribution from atc and cash received from the sale of its interest in kewaunee 
mge raised million by issuing common stock for its dividend reinvestment and direct stock purchase plan the plan 
mge issues new shares of common stock for the plan to improve cash flow and capitalization ratios 
mge s first mortgage bonds are currently rated aa by moody s investors service  inc moody s and aa by standard poor s corp 
s p 
mge s medium term notes are rated aa by moody s and aa by s p 
mge s dealer issued commercial paper carries the highest ratings assigned by moody s and s p 
mge energy is not yet rated because it has not issued any debt securities 
mge s access to the capital markets  including the commercial paper market  and its financing costs in those markets are dependent on its securities ratings 
none of mge s borrowing is subject to default or prepayment due to downgrading of securities ratings 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments for mge energy and mge mge energy and mge s contractual obligations as of december   representing cash obligations that are considered to be firm commitments  are as follows in thousands payment due within due after total year years years years long term debt     short term debt   operating leases      purchase obligations      other long term obligations  total contractual obligations      for additional information about long term debt consisting of secured first mortgage bonds and unsecured medium term notes  see footnote c of the notes to consolidated financial statements

at december   there were no borrowings against the credit facility 
additionally  at december   there was million of commercial paper outstanding 
b mge has a letter of credit with a commercial bank established as collateral for equipment purchases that atc will make to provide necessary system upgrades for the wccf 
c mge energy has established two temporary lines of credit  one for temporary financing of the capital commitments for the wccf million and one for general corporate purposes million 
both lines expire in the first half of additionally  at december   mge energy had million in bank loans outstanding 
d mge has guaranteed repayment of certain receivables it has sold to a financial institution under a chattel paper agreement see footnote of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
other factors due to the performance of the united states debt and equity markets  the value of assets held in trusts to satisfy the obligations of pension and postretirement benefit plans has decreased 
these factors may also result in additional future funding requirements of the pension and postretirement benefit plans 
business and regulatory environment electric transmission atc on january   mge transferred substantially all of its electric transmission facilities to atc in exchange for approximately a interest in this joint venture 
atc is comprised of wisconsin investor owned utilities and some wisconsin municipal utilities  cooperatives  and power supply agencies 
effective october   the pscw authorized an electric rate surcharge of million or for mge to recover deferred costs associated with atc s formation and ongoing incremental transmission costs during and the surcharge will be in effect for a month period ending october  on november   mge and atc entered into a generation transmission interconnection agreement related to transmission system upgrades due to the wccf 
mge issued to atc a notice to proceed for the procurement of the equipment for the system upgrades 
in accordance with the agreement  mge had to provide atc with a form of security  such as a letter of credit or a collateral account  in the amount of million 
mge set up a collateral escrow account to satisfy the security interest to atc until mge was able to secure a letter of credit from a commercial bank  which it received on december  the collateral account was terminated on january  mge will make an estimated million capital payment for transmission equipment and work done by atc throughout related to the wccf 
mge expects to be reimbursed by atc for its capital outlay once the project is completed 
kewaunee effective september   mge sold to wpsc its ownership interest in kewaunee 
in exchange for a cash payment of million  mge transferred its net book value of utility plant million  net nuclear fuel million  inventories million  and other assets million 
these assets were offset by million owed to wpsc 
on the closing date  mge also transferred its qualified decommissioning fund million fair market value and nonqualified decommissioning fund million fair market value  which decreased accumulated depreciation by an equal amount 
this transaction occurred in accordance with an agreement between mge and wpsc dated september  that agreement required certain continuing obligations of mge and wpsc after the closing date  as described below 
mge made monthly contributions to the mge nonqualified decommissioning fund from september   in the amount of approximately million the level authorized by the pscw through december  these costs were recovered from customers in rates 
mge s decommissioning liability is limited to the fund balances at the closing date plus all decommissioning collections through mge s nonqualified decommissioning fund is shown on the balance sheet in the utility plant section 
as of december   this fund totaled million pretax fair market value and was offset by an equal amount recorded in accumulated provision for depreciation 
the securities and uninvested cash balances in the fund  net of trust investment expenses and taxes on investment income  were transferred to the wpsc nonqualified decommissioning fund on january  the federal government is responsible for the disposition and storage of spent nuclear fuel 
federal legislation is being considered to establish an interim storage facility 
spent nuclear fuel is currently stored at kewaunee 
minor plant modifications to the spent fuel pools in should ensure kewaunee has sufficient fuel storage capacity until the end of its licensed life in mge retains its spent fuel obligations for all fuel burned at kewaunee for mge s generation from the opening of the plant to the closing date 
wpsc took title to such fuel at the closing date 
a surcharge imposed by the national energy policy act of requires nuclear power companies to fund the decontamination and decommissioning of us department of energy facilities that process nuclear fuel 
as a result  the kewaunee co owners are required to pay a surcharge on uranium enrichment services purchased from the federal government prior to october  on an inflation adjusted basis  mge s portion of the obligation related to kewaunee is approximately million at december  mge is required to continue paying its portion of this annual assessment 
in accordance with the sale agreement  mge exercised its option in june to buy electric capacity and energy at a fixed price from wpsc 
mge purchased mws of electric capacity and energy from september   through december   and will continue to do so through september   to help meet customers electric needs 
formation of holding company on august   mge energy became the holding company for mge following a share exchange 
each share of mge common stock was exchanged for one share of mge energy common stock 
mge energy s consolidated financial statements reflect this transaction for all periods presented 
mge energy s operations are based primarily on the operations of mge 
consequently  mge constitutes a majority of the assets  liabilities  and results of operations of mge energy and is expected to continue to do so for the foreseeable future 
industry restructuring in wisconsin wisconsin has focused on building the infrastructure needed to provide reliable electric service to customers 
state regulators realize a competitive market cannot exist when supply is short 
the pscw will decide when it is appropriate for retail competition to proceed in the electric industry 
mge cannot predict what impact future pscw actions may have on its future financial condition  cash flows  and results of operations 
however  mge believes it is well positioned to compete 
restructuring the electric industry could affect mge s ability to continue establishing certain regulatory asset and liability amounts allowed under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
mge is unable to predict whether any adjustments to regulatory assets and liabilities will occur in the future 
however  the pscw has recognized the need to allow recovery for commitments made under prior regulation 
gas cost incentives under mge s gas cost incentives  if actual gas commodity costs are above or below a benchmark set by the pscw  then mge s gas sales service customers and shareholders share equally in any increased costs or savings up to million 
any costs or savings that exceed million will be passed on to gas sales service customers 
the pscw allows mge to resell gas pipeline capacity reserved to meet peak demands but not needed every day to serve customers 
revenues from capacity release that exceed or fall short of pscw targeted levels are shared equally 
in  mge shareholders benefited million after tax from capacity release revenues and commodity savings under the gas cost incentives 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to apply policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect results of operations and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements 
because of the inherent uncertainty in the nature of the matters where estimates are used  actual amounts could differ from estimated amounts 
the following accounting policies represent those that management believes are particularly important to the financial statements and require the use of judgment in estimating matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenues revenues from the sale of electricity and gas to customers are generally recorded when electricity gas is delivered to those customers 
the quantity of those sales is measured by customers meters 
due to the large volume of those meters  it is impractical to read all of them at month end and  thus  those meters are read on a systematic basis throughout the month based on established meter reading schedules 
consequently  at the end of any month  there exists a quantity of electricity and gas that has been delivered to customers but has not been captured by the meter readings 
as a result  management must estimate revenue related to electricity and gas delivered to customers between their meter read dates and the end of the period 
these estimates include the amount of electricity expected to be lost in the process of its transmission and distribution to customers line loss and  therefore  the amount of electricity actually delivered to customers 
the mix of sales between customer rate classes  which is based upon historical utilization assumptions 
mge believes that the ratio of unbilled to billed electric sales should typically fall in a to range on a monthly basis 
a ratio outside that range would indicate a need for further review and analysis 
it should be noted that a small change in line loss could have a significant impact on estimated electric unbilled revenues 
pension plans mge maintains qualified and nonqualified pension plans 
mge also provides health care and life insurance benefits for its retired employees 
mge s pensions are funded through an outside trust 
the recent declines in the stock market have resulted in equally consistent declines in the investments in the trusts 
the years through have been the worst three year period of pension plan financing ever  which produced the lowest returns since through due to the loss in asset value  mge is required to record an additional minimum pension liability and corresponding charge to equity at the end of the year 
in addition to the market returns  various other assumptions also affect the investment returns and pension costs 
assumed return on assets 
an assumption as to the rate of return on plan assets reflecting the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation 
for the year  mge used a assumed return on assets 
this rate was set at the end of one of the approaches mge used in determining its assumed return assets is based on historical returns 
as of december   the ten year historical return was 
for  mge has reduced the assumed return on assets to 
discount rate 
the discount rate for sfas pension cost purposes is a rate at which pension obligations could be effectively settled 
mge bases its rate on high grade bond yields with a basis point adder 
this adder is based on the relatively long duration of pension plan liabilities  benefit payments that are in the form of an annuity  and the rate used has historically been at the top of the range 
moody s aa corporate bond yield was on december  this approach generated a discount rate ie  
medical trend assumptions 
the health care cost trend rate is the assumed rate of increase in per capita health care charges 
for  the health trend was reset to with the ultimate trend of reached in in  the health trend was again reset to with the ultimate trend of reached in accounting for derivative instruments mge accounts for derivative financial instruments under sfas no 
 accounting for derivatives and hedging activities 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 all derivatives are recognized on the balance sheet at their fair value 
fair value is determined using current quoted market prices 
if a contract is designated as a cash flow hedge  the change in its market value is generally deferred as a component of other comprehensive income until the transaction it is hedging is completed 
conversely  the change in the market value of a derivative not designated as a cash flow hedge is recorded in current period earnings 
a cash flow hedge is a hedge of a forecasted transaction or the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability 
to qualify as a cash flow hedge  the fair value changes in the derivative must be expected to offset to of the changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged item 
in the third quarter of  mge received approval from the pscw to establish a regulatory asset or liability for the deferral of the effects of mark to market accounting as required by sfas no 
on contracts related to mge s regulated operations 
regulatory assets liabilities regulatory assets represent costs that have been deferred to future periods when it is probable or certain that the regulator will allow future recovery of those costs through rates 
mge bases its assessment of recovery by precedents established by the regulatory body 
regulatory liabilities represent previous collections from customers to fund future expected costs or amounts received in rates that are expected to be refunded to customers in future periods 
these costs typically include the recovery of stranded costs due to deregulation  deferral of energy costs  the normalization of income taxes  and the deferral of losses incurred on debt retirements 
the accounting for these regulatory assets and liabilities is in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
mge continually assesses whether the regulatory assets continue to meet the criteria for probability of future recovery 
this assessment considers factors such as changes in the regulatory environment  recent rate orders to other regulated entities under the same jurisdiction  and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation 
if future recovery of costs becomes no longer probable  the assets and liabilities would be recognized as current period revenue or expense 
amortization of regulatory assets is provided over the recovery period as allowed in the related regulatory agreement 
it is also included in depreciation and amortization expense 
the most significant regulatory assets recorded by mge include demand side management programs  decommissioning and decontaminating enrichment facilities  environmental costs  deferred charges related to the setup of atc  deferred charges on the interest expense of its a series first mortgage bonds  deferred charges related to the effects of mark to market accounting as required by sfas no 
 and deferred charges related to tax recovery on afudc equity see footnote f new accounting pronouncements sfas nos

 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
 which is effective january   requires entities to record the fair value of a legal liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
when a new liability is recorded beginning in  the entity will capitalize the cost of the liability by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement 
mge adopted sfas no 
on january  mge completed an assessment of the specific applicability and implications of sfas no 
mge found that sfas no 
has specific applicability to various electric generating and substation facilities located on leased property  as well as various electric and gas distribution facilities installed on easements or permits 
the asset retirement obligation associated with electric generating and substation facilities is approximately million 
the asset retirement obligations associated with the electric and gas distribution facilities cannot be reasonably estimated due to an indeterminate life of the associated assets 
mge believes that the adoption of sfas no 
results primarily in timing differences in the recognition of the legal asset retirement obligations and the asset retirement costs which mge is currently recovering in rates and will be deferring such differences under sfas no 
early in  mge received assurance from the pscw that the adoption of sfas no 
would not result in a change to the current ratemaking process at this time

in addition  the statement amends the disclosure requirements of statement to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
mge energy has no stock options as of december   and therefore sfas no 
will have no impact 
eitf issue eitf issue  accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities eitf  issued by the fasb eitf in june  requires revenues and energy costs related to energy trading contracts to be presented on a net basis in the income statement 
this eitf has no current impact on the consolidated financial statements 
fin in november  the fasb issued financial interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this interpretation provides the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in interim and annual financial statements about obligations under certain guarantees 
the interpretation also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation 
the initial recognition and measurement requirements are effective prospectively for guarantees issued or modified after december  however  the disclosure requirements of the interpretation are effective for this form k and included in footnote fin in january  the fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  that addresses conditions when an entity should be consolidated based upon variable interests rather than voting interests 
variable interests are ownership interests or contractual relationships that enable the holder to share in the financial risks and rewards resulting from the activities of a variable interest entity vie 
a vie is a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either does not have equity investors with voting rights or has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
in order to apply fin  mge must evaluate every entity with which it is involved through variable interests to determine whether the entity is a vie and  if it is  whether or not mge is the primary beneficiary of the entity 
the primary beneficiary of a vie is the entity that receives the majority of the entity s expected losses  residual returns  or both 
as a result  fin could result in consolidation of an entity that mge is associated with other than by and even in the absence of a voting ownership interest 
fin is not believed to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
inflation the current financial statements report operating results in terms of historical cost  but they do not evaluate the impact of inflation 
because utilities can depreciate only the historical cost of utility plant  there may not be adequate cash flows from existing plant to replace this investment 
under pscw rate treatment  projected operating costs  including the impacts of inflation  are recovered in revenues 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks mge is potentially exposed to market risk associated with interest rates  commodity prices  weather  and equity returns 
mge currently has no exposure to foreign currency risk 
mge manages some risk exposure through risk management policies and uses derivative instruments 
interest rate risk mge issues commercial paper at varying interest rates for its short term borrowings see footnote d mge also has million in variable rate long term debt outstanding as of december  borrowing levels under commercial paper arrangements vary from period to period depending upon capital investments and other factors 
future short term interest expense and payments will reflect both future short term interest rates and borrowing levels 
mge has a swap agreement with a commercial bank at a notional amount of million  backed by mge s commercial paper 
mge pays a fixed rate of on the swap  which was used to replace a portion of mge s  series  first mortgage bonds 
mge manages its interest rate risk by limiting its variable rate exposure and continually monitoring the effects of market changes on interest rates 
mge is not exposed to changes in interest rates on a substantial portion of its long term debt until that debt matures and is refinanced at market rates 
mge records the changes in the fair market value of its commercial paper swap agreement currently in the income statement as required by sfas no 
each period  which is then offset by a corresponding regulatory asset or liability in accordance with the pscw 
commodity price risk mge has commodity price risk exposure with respect to the price of natural gas  electricity  coal  and oil 
mge employs established policies and procedures to reduce the market risks associated with changing commodity prices  including the use of commodity and financial instruments see footnote 
mge s commodity risks are somewhat mitigated by the current ratemaking process in place for recovering electric fuel  purchased energy  and the cost of natural gas purchased for resale 
mge s electric fuel costs are subject to fuel rules  established by the pscw  which further mitigate commodity risk 
under fuel rules  if electric fuel costs exceed or fall below a bandwidth set by the pscw  mge can apply for a fuel surcharge or may have a fuel credit to its customers 
under the pga authorized by the pscw  mge passes through to customers the cost of gas  subject to certain limited incentives 
mge has a limited number of financial gas commodity contracts 
these contracts are primarily comprised of exchange traded option contracts to manage the cost of gas and over the counter financial floating to fixed price swaps and calls for the winter set price firm gas sales service pilot program 
the derivative amounts recorded as a result of these gas contracts are offset with a corresponding regulatory asset or liability because these transactions are part of the pga and not subject to incentive participation 
weather risk mge s sales forecasts are set by the pscw based upon estimated temperatures  which approximate year averages 
mge s electric revenues are sensitive to the summer cooling season  and to some extent  to the winter heating season 
a significant portion of mge s gas system demand is driven by heating 
mge s gas margin revenues less gas purchased are collected under a combination of fixed and volumetric rates set by the pscw based on normal weather 
as a result of weather sensitive demand and volumetric rates  a portion of mge s gas margin is at risk for warmer than normal weather 
mge uses weather derivatives  pursuant to its risk management program  to reduce the impact of weather volatility on its gas margins 
a summary of actual weather information in the utility segment s service territory during   and  as measured by degree days  may be found above in results of operations 
regulatory recovery risk the electric operations of mge burn natural gas in several of its peak power plants or as a supplemental fuel at several coal fired plants and in many cases the cost of purchased power is tied to the cost of natural gas 
mge bears significant regulatory risk for the recovery of such fuel and purchased power costs when they are higher than the base rate established in its current rate structure 
as noted above in commodity price risk  the electric operations of mge operate under a fuel rules adjustment clause for fuel and purchased power costs associated with the generation and delivery of electricity 
this clause establishes a base rate for fuel and purchased power 
mge assumes the risks and benefits of variances that are within a bandwidth 
for and  fuel and purchased power costs included in mge s base fuel rates were million and million  respectively 
in  the base fuel rates included a fuel credit in the amount of million 
equity price risks mge currently funds its liabilities related to employee benefits through trust funds 
these funds  which include investments in debt and equity securities  are managed by various investment managers 
changes in market value of these investments can have an impact on the future expenses related to these liabilities 
mge s risk of expense and annuity payments  as a result of changes in the market value of the trust funds  is mitigated in part through future rate actions by the pscw 
credit risks credit risk is the loss that may result from counterparty nonperformance 
mge is exposed to credit risk primarily through its merchant energy business 
mge uses credit policies to manage its credit risk  which includes utilizing an established credit approval process  monitoring counterparty limits  employing credit mitigation measures such as collateral or prepayment arrangements  and using netting agreements 
due to the possibility of extreme volatility in the prices of energy commodities and derivatives  the market value of contractual positions with individual counterparties could exceed established credit limits or collateral provided by those counterparties 
if such a counterparty were then to fail to perform its obligations under its contract for example  fail to deliver the electricity mge originally contracted for  mge could sustain a loss that could have a material impact on its financial results 
additionally  if a counterparty were to default and mge were to liquidate all contracts with that entity  mge s credit loss would include the loss in value of mark to market contracts  the amount owed for settled transactions  and additional payments  if any  to settle unrealized losses on accrual contracts 
mge is obligated to provide service to all electric and gas customers within its respective franchised territories 
as a result  mge has a broad customer base 
for the year ended december   mge s ten largest electric customers represented approximately of its retail electric revenues 
mge s ten largest gas customers represented approximately of its gas revenues 
credit risk for electric and gas is managed by mge s credit and collection policies  which are consistent with state regulatory requirements
