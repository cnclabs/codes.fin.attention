the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements  including the notes thereto  included elsewhere in this annual report 
overview since our inception in  we have focused our efforts on developing  manufacturing and commercializing medical tissue adhesive products for use in wound closure in humans and animals 
in addition  our research efforts include the development of internal adhesive products 
during  dermabond adhesive continued to be our leading product 
early in  we received fda approval to include in our device labeling that dermabond adhesive acts as a barrier to microbial penetration 
clinically  this provides for the potential reduction of infection rates  as long as the adhesive remains intact  when closing incisions and lacerations with dermabond adhesive versus the traditional use of sutures and staples which have not been shown to protect against microbial penetration 
we believe that this claim has supported the increased penetration of dermabond adhesive  particularly in the operating room 
in addition  we completed the enrollment and follow up of an patient definitive clinical trial for a high viscosity  or thicker  version of dermabond adhesive 
this version is our second product line extension and will allow for more precise application without the rundown experienced with the less viscous versions 
we received approval from the us food drug administration to market the high viscosity dermabond topical skin adhesive in january as a result of the effort during also  during the summer of  ethicon initiated a direct to consumer television and print campaign  the first time ever for any of its products  to increase awareness and preference for dermabond adhesive among consumers 
also  our marketing partner  cpc  launched our liquid bandage under the name band aid r brand liquid bandage during the spring of cpc executed a print and television advertising campaign during the summer months to increase consumer awareness of the liquid bandage 
we believe the efforts of cpc were effective in establishing band aid r brand liquid bandage in the consumer bandage market 
in addition  band aid r brand liquid bandage was one of only seven products to receive a good housekeeping good buy award for best new household products introduced during  and was the only personal healthcare product to win the award 
during  we continued the development of our internal adhesive and wound management projects 
our vascular sealant product is based on our core cyanoacrylate technology and is intended for use inside the human body 
we plan to file an investigational device exemption with the fda in  with human clinical trials to follow 
we are continuing to evaluate other opportunities  such as our elvr product  to use our cyanoacrylate technology inside the body 
we have continued the development of our liquid occlusive dressing  or lod  to treat partial thickness wounds such as pressure ulcers and skin tears 
to date  we have completed animal research as well as a patient human pilot clinical study for pressure ulcers 
a second pilot clinical study is ongoing to further define the lod wear time and wound healing rates versus leading dressings in the category 
based on the outcomes from the pilot studies  we anticipate the initiation of a definitive  multi center  human clinical study allowing for fda approval through the k premarket clearance 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
total revenues for were  compared to  for product revenues increased by which is primarily due to sales of band aid r brand liquid bandage  launched in april by cpc as well as increased shipments of dermabond adhesive 
in  dermabond adhesive continued to represent the majority of total revenues  approximately 
license and product development revenues increased during to  from  in as revenue previously deferred was recognized ratably over the lives of various contracts with our marketing partners 
in and  and of product sales were to one customer  respectively 
cost of products sold 
cost of products sold for was  compared to  for cost of products sold as a percentage of revenues was approximately for and for the decrease is attributable to increased production volumes and cost containment 
also  our product sales mix continues to be heavily weighted with the dermabond product  which has significantly higher margins than our over the counter products 
we expect that future gross margins on product sales will fluctuate based on production volumes and the relative proportion of professional and otc products 
operating expenses 
operating expenses were approximately  and  for and  respectively 
operating expenses consist of research  development and regulatory affairs expenses and general and administrative expenses 
during  research  development and regulatory affairs expenses were primarily focused on the development of dermabond adhesive line extensions  including the high viscosity clinical study  the development of an internal vascular sealant and wound management products and basic research 
we expect these expenses will increase as we expand our product pipeline and related development efforts and clinical trials for potential new products  in particular our internal adhesives 
overall  general and administrative expenses increased in primarily due to a charge of approximately  related to the transition of the ceo position 
the charge included approximately  related to transition services provided by our former ceo and his entering into a non competition agreement 
the remainder primarily related to the taxes and benefits on the transition services and recruitment costs associated with the selection of a new ceo 
in addition  general and administrative costs for increased due to additional outside professional services and personnel costs over the period 
interest income  net 
net interest income for decreased to  from  for total interest income decreased primarily due to lower investment yields as a result of market interest rate changes during interest expense also declined due to the continued reduction of our term loan balance and capital lease obligations through monthly principal payments coupled with a decline in interest rates associated with those obligations 
all capital lease obligations were retired during income taxes 
prior to  no deferred provision or benefit for income taxes was recorded because we were in a net deferred tax asset position and a full valuation allowance had been recorded 
during the fourth quarter of  we re evaluated the amount of valuation allowance required in light of numerous factors including the profitability achieved in recent years and expected in future years 
as a result  we reduced the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets to an amount that we believe is more likely than not of being realized based on our assessment of the likelihood of near term operating income coupled with uncertainties with respect to the impact of future market conditions 
at december   the valuation allowance primarily reflects uncertainties involving the realization of state tax credits and loss carryforwards 
the valuation allowance was reduced by  during  including  related to net operating losses generated by the exercise of stock options prior to this portion of the reduction in the valuation allowance  along with  in similar tax benefits from stock option exercises during  was credited to additional paid in capital 
we estimate that we would need to generate future taxable income of approximately million to fully utilize our federal net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards existing as of december  year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
total revenues for were  compared to  for product revenues increased by which is primarily due to increased shipments of dermabond adhesive 
also contributing to this increase was the launch of soothe n seal r adhesive  including a significant amount of samples  into the consumer market in the second quarter of by colgate 
license and product development revenues increased during to  from  in as revenue previously deferred was recognized ratably over the lives of various contracts with our marketing partners  including those entered into during cost of products sold 
cost of products sold for was  compared to  for cost of products sold as a percentage of product sales remained fairly constant at approximately for and although sales volume increased  this percentage remained steady due to the mix of the products during which included the lower margin soothe n seal r adhesive and related samples 
we expect that future gross margins on product sales will fluctuate based on production volumes and the relative proportion of professional and otc products 
operating expenses 
operating expenses were approximately  and  for and  respectively 
operating expenses primarily consist of research  development and regulatory affairs expenses and general and administrative expenses and  in  included expenses related to a voluntary packaging recall 
during  research  development and regulatory affairs expenses were primarily focused on the development of dermabond adhesive line extensions  the development of a liquid occlusive dressing  other product development and basic research 
during  we were not involved in any clinical trials 
during  research  development and regulatory affairs expenses were primarily focused on clinical trials for band aid r brand liquid bandage  the development of dermabond adhesive line extensions  other product development and basic research 
we expect these expenses will increase as we expand our product pipeline and related development efforts and clinical trials for potential new products  in particular our internal adhesive products 
overall  general and administrative expenses remained fairly consistent with the exception of salary expenses which increased during the period due to increased headcount 
also in  we recorded a special charge related to the voluntary packaging recall of three production lots of dermabond adhesive due to blister packaging seals that may have been compromised due to a mechanized packaging problem 
the related costs of this recall were estimated to be approximately  and consist primarily of costs to notify customers  cost of replacement product and shipping expenses 
interest income  net 
net interest income for decreased to  from  for total interest income decreased primarily due to lower investment yields as a result of market interest rate changes during interest expense also declined due to the continued reduction of our term loan balance and capital lease obligations through monthly principal payments coupled with a decline in interest rates associated with those obligations 
income taxes 
during  tax expense was recorded for the first time by closure in the amount of  this amount represents alternative minimum taxes that cannot be eliminated through the use of net operating loss carryforwards 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations to date primarily through the sale of equity securities  borrowings from lenders  license and product development revenues and product sales 
our principal sources of liquidity include cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments  which totaled million at december in may  our equipment term loan and line of credit matured and the outstanding balance of approximately  was refinanced as a borrowing within our million line of credit  which was simultaneously renewed for a two year period 
the renewed agreement contains certain restrictive covenants including  but not limited to  maintenance of certain levels of unencumbered liquid assets and a minimum tangible net worth requirement 
the agreement is secured by certain trade accounts receivable  inventory and equipment 
the december  outstanding balance of  was classified as long term debt as the agreement does not require principal payments within the next months 
although our current payment pattern will allow for extinguishment of debt by june   we are not required to pay all outstanding principal plus accrued and unpaid interest until maturity at may  future minimum lease payments under noncancellable operating leases are approximately million over the next five years 
the majority of operating lease obligations relate to our facility lease 
capital expenditures there are no individually material capital expenditure commitments outstanding as of december  however  we estimate that capital investments for could be at least million to support manufacturing scale up initiatives 
we believe that our balances of cash  cash equivalents  and investments together with funds generated from operations and existing borrowing facilities will be sufficient to meet our operating cash requirements and fund required capital expenditures for the foreseeable future 
research and development during  closure spent approximately million in research  development and regulatory affairs expenses compared to million in the increase was primarily due to development and regulatory expenses surrounding the high viscosity dermabond clinical and regulatory approval process as well as ongoing research related to the internal adhesive and liquid occlusive dressing products 
we continued to increase our research and development activities to maintain a competitive advantage and we anticipate that research and development expenses will increase for the next several years as we develop new products and line extensions for existing products 
we also expect that clinical trials related to new products and line extensions will be costly and represent a significant part of future expenses 
research  development and regulatory affairs expenses consist of items related to personnel  costs of supplies  clinical trials  facility costs and fees paid to consultants and outside contractors and providers and are expensed as incurred 
we have arrangements with certain marketing partners in which we share certain research  development and regulatory affairs expenses related to approved projects 
during  and we were reimbursed   and  respectively  in accordance with these cost sharing arrangements 
we cannot estimate the costs to complete our internal research and development projects due to uncertainties regarding successful completion of projects  clinical trial outcomes  regulatory approvals and cost sharing arrangements with partners 
we believe that funds for future research and development needs can be obtained from existing cash and investment balances and from cash generated from operations 
however  no assurance can be given that we may not require additional funds to support the completion of new product development  conduct clinical trials and obtain regulatory approvals 
cash flows net cash provided by operating activities was  for compared to  for the increase in cash provided by operations was primarily due to the increase in net income during the period offset by the change in deferred taxes 
net cash used by investing activities was  during and  during the period 
the increase in net cash used during primarily related to the increased net investment in marketable securities whereas net cash used in primarily related to purchases of fixed assets and the investment in intangible assets 
net cash used by financing activities was  during compared to  for our primary financing activities during both years were the repayment of debt and capital lease obligations  offset by the proceeds from the sale of stock under our stock option and other benefit plans 
based on our current plans  we believe that existing cash  cash equivalents and investments  which totaled million at december   will be sufficient to finance our operating and capital requirements for at least months 
we anticipate that our recurring operating expenses will increase for the next several years  as we expect research  development and regulatory affairs and general and administrative expenses to increase in order to develop new products  manufacture in commercial quantities and fund additional clinical trials 
we also may invest in long term assets such as intangible assets and capital expenditures to expand our manufacturing capabilities 
our future capital requirements  however  will depend on numerous factors  including but not limited to the following 
our ability to manufacture and commercialize successfully our existing products  including dermabond adhesive and liquid bandage  
the progress of our research and product development programs for future nonabsorbable and internal adhesive products  including clinical studies  
the effectiveness of product commercialization activities and marketing agreements for our future products  including the scale up of manufacturing capabilities for increased capacity in anticipation of product commercialization and development as well as progress of sales and marketing efforts  
our ability to maintain existing marketing agreements  including our agreement with ethicon for dermabond adhesive  and establish and maintain new marketing agreements  
our ability to achieve product development milestones  
the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing intellectual property rights and complying with regulatory requirements  
the effect of competing technological and market developments  
timely receipt of regulatory clearances and approvals  
general acceptance of our products by the medical community and consumers  and 
general economic conditions 
we may be required to seek additional capital to finance our operations in the future 
if our currently available funds and internally generated cash flow are not sufficient to satisfy our financing and operating needs  we will be required to seek additional funding through bank borrowings  additional public or private sales of our securities  including equity securities  or through other arrangements with marketing partners 
other than our working capital line of credit  we have no credit facility or other committed sources of capital 
there can be no assurance that additional funds  if required  will be available to us on favorable terms  if at all
