item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes in item of this report 
the discussion contains forward looking statements that involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties  including those set forth below under factors that may affect future results 
overview we develop hardware and software platforms that original equipment manufacturers  or oems  developers and corporate information technology managers build into their communications systems 
customers incorporate our products into applications  systems and services that allow voice  fax and data to be distributed over both internet protocol  or ip  packet based networks  which we refer to as the new network  and the traditional circuit based telephone network 
we supply products for media processing  network interface  call control and signal processing  including protocols that allow internet and traditional telephony systems to communicate 
we measure our operating success using both financial and market metrics 
the financial metrics include revenue  gross margin  operating expenses  income from continuing operations and cash provided by operating activities 
other key metrics include the total number of enterprise and service provider customers  customers whose purchases exceed  and the portion of our revenue that is generated by the sales of products for applications in the new network 
our long term business model stresses our commitment to establishing and maintaining close customer relationships and to continuing to develop innovative products 
the most significant trend that has impacted our business during the past two years has been the unfavorable economic conditions affecting most technology sectors and the communications sector in particular 
this has resulted in a decrease in our revenue in and compared to prior years 
sales of products  particularly for applications in the new network  sold to oems for use by large service providers have declined most significantly 
in response to the revenue decreases  we implemented expense control programs to reduce operating expenses  while at the same time  we have continued to invest in developing products that we believe our customers will need when the economy improves 
despite these difficult economic conditions  we have been able to increase our cash and marketable debt securities balances from million at december  to million at december  this was accomplished primarily through operating expense reductions  the sale of a business segment and income tax refunds 
if current adverse economic conditions continue for an extended period of time or worsen  we may experience adverse effects on our business  operating results  and cash and marketable debt securities 
application of critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we make estimates and assumptions in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenue and expenses  and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions the following critical accounting policies require the use of significant judgment and estimates in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
this listing is not a comprehensive list of all of our significant accounting policies 
for further information regarding the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales is recognized upon shipment to the customer which constitutes delivery  provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
in determining when to recognize revenue we often are required to exercise judgment 
to the extent that one or more of these criteria are not met  which has occurred from time to time  revenue is deferred until such time as all four conditions are satisfied 
we record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product sales in the same period as the related revenue is recorded 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data and other known factors 
actual results could differ from these estimates and could therefore impact our results of operations and cash flows 
allowances for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
the estimated allowance for doubtful amounts is based primarily on a specific analysis of accounts in the receivable portfolio and a general reserve based on the aging of receivables 
while management believes the allowance to be adequate  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required and could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
inventory allowances we evaluate our ending inventories for estimated excess quantities and obsolescence 
this evaluation includes analyses of sales levels by product and projections of future demand 
in addition  we assess the impact of changing technology on our inventory on hand 
we provide reserves for inventories that are considered excess or obsolete 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory reserves may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period in which the revision is made 
these actions could impact both our results of operations and our cash flows 
intangible assets we review our intangible assets for impairment periodically and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the evaluation of the fair value of our intangible assets includes assumptions regarding estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with these assets and other factors 
if these estimates or assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
such an impairment charge would impact the results of operations  but would not directly impact our cash flows 
deferred tax assets we assess the carrying value of our deferred tax assets to determine if it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions in order to realize these assets 
when necessary we have reduced the deferred tax asset to its estimated realizable value by recording a valuation allowance 
this assessment requires us to make estimates and assumptions about our future profitability 
in determining the carrying value of the deferred tax assets as of december   we are assuming profitability in the future and that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize these assets 
this assumption is based in part upon our history of profitability 
if current economic conditions deteriorate or future results of operations are less than expected  future assessments may result in a determination that all or a portion of the remaining deferred tax assets are not realizable 
as a result  we may need to establish additional valuation allowances for all or a portion of the deferred tax assets  which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
accrued warranty costs we accrue for warranty costs based on historical trends in product return rates and the expected material and labor costs to provide warranty services 
if we were to experience an increase in warranty claims compared with our historical experience  or costs of servicing warranty claims were greater than the expectations on which the accrual had been based  our gross margins could be adversely affected 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report for activity in our reserves for estimated warranty costs 
discontinued operations prior to february   we were organized and reported the results of our operations in three operating segments  brooktrout technology  brooktrout software  and interspeed 
on february   our board of directors adopted formal plans to discontinue our brooktrout software and interspeed segments 
we have accounted for these businesses as discontinued operations 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded total gains from discontinued operations of million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   we had a million loss from discontinued operations 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
results of operations the following discussion focuses on our results from continuing operations 
the table below sets forth certain consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of total revenue for the periods presented 
years ended december  domestic revenue international revenue total revenue cost of product sold gross margin operating expenses research and development in process research and development selling  general and administrative total operating expenses operating income loss other income expense  net net loss on investments equity in loss of affiliates interest income  net and other total other income expense  net income loss before income taxes income tax provision benefit income loss from continuing operations revenue the following table presents our domestic and international revenue years ended december  dollars in thousands domestic revenue    international revenue    total revenue    vs 
revenue in was million compared to million in  a decrease of approximately 
the decrease in revenue is primarily attributed to a million sale to a service provider customer in the first quarter of this customer has not purchased any additional product since  leading to lower quarterly revenue since the first quarter of during the past two years  revenue from enterprise customers has remained consistent while revenue from service provider customers has declined 
during  sales of products for applications in the new network accounted for approximately of total revenue  as compared to of total revenue for in  domestic revenue decreased slightly while international revenue remained constant  at approximately million per year  representing an increase from of total revenue in to of total revenue in revenue from captaris accounted for of total revenue in compared to in we expect that revenue from captaris will continue to be greater than of total revenue for revenue from lucent represented of revenue in  but represented less than of total revenue for in  we sold products to over customers 
approximately of these customers each purchased over  of products  in aggregate representing of total revenue 
in  we sold products to over  customers 
approximately of these customers each purchased over  of products  in aggregate representing approximately of total revenue 
vs 
revenue during was million compared to million in  a decrease of approximately 
the decline in revenue resulted primarily from the overall economic slowdown in the united states and international economies and  in particular  the weakness of the communications market 
the decrease in sales extended across all product lines and markets 
sales of products for applications in the new network  specifically those sold to oems for use by large service providers  declined most significantly 
international revenue decreased from million in to million in  although international revenue as a percent of total revenue increased from of total revenue in to in during  sales of products for applications in the new network accounted for approximately of total revenue  as compared to of total revenue for the same period in revenue from captaris accounted for of total revenue in compared to in revenue from lucent represented of revenue in  however  revenue from lucent represented of total revenue in cost of product sold and gross margin the following table presents cost of product sold and gross margin information years ended december  dollars in thousands cost of product sold    gross profit    gross margin vs 
the decrease in cost of product sold from to was primarily the result of a million decrease in inventory obsolescence expense  combined with direct material cost reductions achieved from using new manufacturing subcontractors 
the decrease in inventory obsolescence expense is primarily due to lower levels of excess service provider product inventory in these factors contributed to a slight improvement in gross margin  year over year 
vs 
the decrease in gross margin from to was primarily due to the decrease in revenue  increased inventory obsolescence expense  and the impact of reduced revenue on a base of relatively fixed manufacturing expenses 
inventory obsolescence increased in to million compared to million in this increase in inventory obsolescence was  in part  a result of an industry wide shift from industry standard architecture  or isa  to peripheral component interconnect  or pci  and compactpci  or cpci  technology 
the value of isa inventory was reduced to its net realizable value 
in addition  the inventory obsolescence expense was increased due to the decline in sales volume and decreases in forecasted demand 
our manufacturing facilities  which are primarily fixed expenses  represented a larger percentage of cost of product sold in in comparison to operating expenses the following table presents our operating expenses years ended december  dollars in thousands research and development    in process research and development  selling  general and administrative    total operating expenses    research and development expenses vs 
research and development expense was of revenue in  compared with of revenue in the dollar decrease was primarily the result of reduced consulting  contract labor  and depreciation expense  offset partially by increases in spending on new product prototypes and equipment purchases 
our continuing development efforts are focused on hardware and software for media processing products voice  fax and data  network interface products  call control products and signal processing products 
vs 
research and development expense was of revenue in  compared with of revenue in the dollar decrease was primarily attributable to decreased spending on consulting and contract labor  employee recruiting expense and to a lesser extent  expendable materials and supplies 
in process research and development expenses during  we recorded an in process research and development charge of million for the purchase of rights to certain in process technology that  upon completion  was intended to result in a single cpci circuit board that would provide an sts interface 
at the time of the purchase the sts project had not yet reached technological feasibility and successful development of this technology was uncertain 
on the acquisition date  the technology acquired had no alternative future use 
during  we ceased development of the product for which this technology was originally intended 
expenses associated with this project  through the date we ceased development  were not a significant portion of our overall research and development expenses in either or selling  general and administrative expenses vs 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expense from to was primarily due to a decrease in bad debt expense as a result of improved collectability of accounts receivable  along with reduced spending for variable incentive compensation  travel and entertainment  and depreciation 
these expense decreases were partially offset by increases in marketing expenses associated with the partner access network program 
vs 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expense from to was primarily the result of reduced spending for variable incentive compensation  consulting and contract labor  employee recruiting expenses  travel and entertainment expenses  advertising and promotion expenses  and expendable materials and supplies 
other income expense  net the following table presents our other income expense  net years ended december  dollars in thousands net loss on investments  equity in loss of affiliates   interest income  net and other   total other income expense  net   net loss on investments during  we had a pretax loss on investments of million 
of this total expense  million was due to a permanent reduction of the carrying value of the sonexis preferred stock as a result of a decrease in the appraised value of these shares 
we received this preferred stock  along with cash  as consideration for the sale of brooktrout software in april in addition  we realized a loss of approximately million related to the sale of an equity investment in a privately held technology company that had been accounted for using the cost method 
we had no pretax gains or losses on investments during or equity in loss of affiliates vs 
we recorded equity in loss of affiliates of million in and million in related to net losses of our equity investees  pelago and telchemy 
as of december   the investment in pelago had been written down to zero  and since we have no further funding commitment  we have ceased recording our share of pelago s losses 
our interest in pelago was further reduced below following an equity financing by pelago during we now use the cost method to account for pelago  which has a carrying value of zero at december  we did not recognize additional losses in related to telchemy since we disposed of our equity interest in that business on december  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
we recorded no equity in losses of affiliates during interest income  net and other vs 
the decrease in interest income  net and other from to was the result of a decline in short term interest rates  which offset the favorable impact of increased cash and marketable debt securities balances 
vs 
the decrease in interest income  net and other from to was the result of a significant decline in short term interest rates  which offset the favorable impact from increased marketable debt securities balances 
income tax provision benefit the following table presents our income tax provision benefit and effective tax rate years ended december  dollars in thousands income tax provision benefit    effective tax rate vs 
in both and  we were able to record an income tax benefit  along with an income tax receivable  since we can carry back the loss before income taxes for and to prior years in which we were profitable 
the reduction in the income tax benefit rate in was due to recording a valuation allowance related to long term investments 
the valuation allowance is necessary since it is more likely than not that a portion of our deferred tax assets related to long term investments may not be realized 
vs 
the increase in the effective tax rate from to was principally due to a research and development tax credit 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows for the years ended december    and net cash provided by operating activities was million in this increase primarily resulted from tax refunds of million and inventory reductions that were offset by changes in other components of working capital 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in this primarily resulted from reductions in inventory  accounts receivable and net liabilities of discontinued operations 
net cash used in operating activities was million in we used cash primarily to purchase inventory 
net cash used in investing activities was million in this primarily resulted from net purchases of marketable debt securities of million and capital equipment purchases of million 
net cash used in investing activities was million in this primarily resulted from net purchases of marketable debt securities of million and purchases of investments of million  offset by the million of proceeds from the sale of brooktrout software to sonexis in april net cash used in investing activities was million in this primarily resulted from capital purchases of million  purchases of investments of million  and purchases of acquired software of million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million and million in and  respectively  all attributable to proceeds from the sale of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan in both periods 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  million of which was attributable to proceeds from the sale of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan and stock option plans 
contractual obligations and capital expenditures the following table presents our future contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  total thereafter dollars in thousands operating leases     we have operating lease commitments for our primary office and manufacturing facilities that expire between and in addition  we lease office space for sales and support functions that expire beyond certain lease agreements require us to pay all of the building s taxes  insurance and maintenance costs 
we purchased million of capital equipment in  million in  and million in we currently have no material commitments for additional capital expenditures  but we do have certain inventory purchase commitments that are part of our ordinary course of business 
our purchasing arrangements with vendors typically allow for cancellations without significant adverse financial implications 
we had no long term debt as of december  or february  cash and cash requirements years ended december  dollars in thousands cash and cash equivalents    marketable debt securities    total    working capital quick ratio tax refunds received  available line of credit    working capital decreased by approximately million from to this decrease was the result of decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses due to reduced inventory purchases and lower operating expenses  offset by a decrease in current deferred tax assets 
our quick ratio improved from in to in  due primarily to a reduction of current liabilities by  from million as of december  to million as of december   while we increased cash and marketable debt securities balances 
we have a million working capital line of credit available from a commercial bank 
availability of funds under this line of credit is subject to compliance with certain covenants  and borrowings bear interest at the lender s prime rate 
the line of credit is secured by a pledge of substantially all of our assets 
as of december  and february   letters of credit issued against the existing line totaled million  representing the collateral required for certain lease obligations 
other than the issuance of letters of credit and using the credit line to secure immaterial foreign currency forward contracts  there have been no borrowings under the line during the past three years 
the line of credit expires on june  we anticipate that the line of credit will be renewed on substantially the same terms as the existing line of credit 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable debt securities increased from million as of december  to million as of december  we are expecting to receive tax refunds in and believe that these tax refunds  along with our anticipated cash flows from operating activities  are likely to meet our needs for the foreseeable future 
in addition  though we do not expect to make any major capital expenditures in  we are always looking for opportunities to expand the business  which could include acquisitions or organic expansion into new markets 
if we find that our cash  marketable debt securities and funds available from our bank line of credit are not sufficient  we may choose to utilize or to seek other sources of financing 
if we were to seek future equity financings  the terms may be dilutive to our stockholders and may contain restrictive covenants  which could limit our ability to pursue certain courses of action 
it is possible that  should the need arise  we will not be able to obtain additional financing  or that the financing made available to us will not be on acceptable terms 
the pricing of our products and the costs of our goods can be significantly affected by current market conditions 
market conditions can be impacted by inflation  however  we believe that inflation has not had a significant effect on our operations to date 
recent accounting pronouncements we have adopted statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
these pronouncements provide guidance on the accounting for the acquisition of businesses and intangible assets  including goodwill  which arise from such activities 
sfas no 
provides that goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite useful lives resulting from business combinations can no longer be amortized to expense  but rather requires an annual assessment of impairment and  if necessary  adjustments to the carrying value of goodwill 
the adoption of sfas nos 
and did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
as of january   we had no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
included in intangible assets are amounts allocated to workforce in place  which sfas no 
requires be reclassified to goodwill  such assets were fully amortized prior to january   and as a result  no adjustments or reclassifications were required 
we have adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
establishes a single accounting model for impairment or disposal of long lived assets  including discontinued operations 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements and had no effect on the accounting applied to the discontinued businesses described above under discontinued operations 
we will continue to account for and present discontinued operations relative to these businesses in accordance with accounting principles board opinion  or apb  no 
in june  the financial accounting standard board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this pronouncement is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   and requires these costs to be recognized when the liability is incurred and not at project initiation 
we are reviewing the provisions of sfas no 
 but do not expect that it will have a material impact on our operations or financial position 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which expands previously issued accounting guidance and disclosure requirements for certain guarantees 
the interpretation requires an entity to recognize an initial liability for the fair value of an obligation assumed by issuing a guarantee 
the provision for initial recognition and measurement of the liability will be applied on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  we do not expect that interpretation no 
will have a material impact on our operations or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which provides optional transition guidance for those companies electing to voluntarily adopt the accounting provisions of sfas no 
in addition  the statement mandates certain interim disclosures that are incremental to those required by sfas no 
we will continue to apply the intrinsic value based method to account for stock option awards granted to employees in accordance with apb opinion no 
and account for stock option awards to non employees in accordance with sfas no 
as such  we do not expect this standard to have a material impact on our operations or financial position 
we have adopted the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 
as of december  factors that may affect future results the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these factors  in which case you could lose all or part of your investment 
you should also refer to the other information in this report  including the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect us 
additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of  or that we currently deem immaterial  also may become important factors that affect us 
risks related to our business downturns in the economy generally  and in sectors of the telecommunications industry in particular  make it difficult to anticipate or expand sales 
as a result of the unfavorable economic conditions affecting most technology sectors and the telecommunications sector in particular  many of our customers are seeking aggressively to increase efficiency in their supply chains and reduce their inventory levels 
additionally  the slowdown in the telecommunications industry and the resulting decrease in spending by companies in our target markets have reduced the rate of growth of data traffic and the use of the internet  which are driving the convergence of data and telephony that we expect will give rise to demand for new network applications 
the economic downturn has adversely affected our business and operating results  including a reduction in revenue of million in  or  from and million  or  from if current economic conditions continue for an extended period of time or worsen  we may experience additional adverse effects on our revenue  net income and cash flow 
for example  as the rate at which our customers order products decreases  it becomes more likely that our current inventories will be exposed to technological obsolescence  which would require us to reduce the value of those inventories on our balance sheet 
if we fail to compete successfully in the highly competitive telecommunications market  our revenue and profitability will suffer 
the market for telecommunications equipment is highly competitive 
if we are unable to differentiate our products from existing and future offerings of our competitors  and thereby effectively compete in the market for telecommunications equipment  our operating results could be materially adversely affected 
many of our current and potential competitors have significantly greater selling and marketing  technical  manufacturing  financial  and other resources 
we expect our current competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their existing products and to introduce new products and enhancements with improved price and performance characteristics 
our product sales may be threatened by new technologies  products or market trends  and we may have to reduce the prices of our products to stay competitive 
in addition  new competitors may emerge in the markets we serve 
an acquisition of  or by  one of our competitors may result in a substantially strengthened competitor with greater financial  engineering  manufacturing  marketing  and customer service and support resources than we have 
if our current or future competitors enter into strategic relationships with leading manufacturers covering products similar to those sold or being developed by us  our ability to sell products to those manufacturers may be adversely affected 
capitalizing on our technology will require a continued high level of investment in research and development  marketing  and customer service and support 
we may be unable  or otherwise fail  to allocate sufficient resources to achieve the technological advances necessary to compete successfully with existing competitors or new entrants 
internal development efforts by our customers may adversely affect demand for our products 
many of our customers  including the large original equipment manufacturers on which we focus a significant portion of our sales and marketing efforts  have the technical and financial ability to design and produce components replicating or improving on the functionality of most of our products 
these customers often consider in house development of technologies and products as an alternative to doing business with us 
we cannot assure you that our existing or potential customers will do business with us  rather than attempting to develop similar technology and products internally or obtaining technology or products through acquisitions 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to find customers to replace the revenue lost as a result of customers developing technologies or products in house 
any such occurrence could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or operating results 
if we fail to develop and sell new or enhanced products for the telecommunications hardware and software market  we will not be able to compete effectively 
the telecommunications hardware and software market is characterized by rapid technological advances  evolving industry standards  changes in customer requirements  frequent new product introductions  declining prices  intense competition  and evolving offerings by telecommunications service providers 
our future success depends in large part on our ability to offer products that address the sophisticated and varied needs of our current and prospective customers and to respond to technological advances and evolving industry standards on a timely and cost effective basis 
the timely development of new or enhanced products is a complex and uncertain process 
we intend to continue to invest significantly in product and technology development 
we may experience design  manufacturing  marketing and other difficulties that could delay or prevent our development  introduction or commercialization of any new and enhanced products 
we may also not be able to incorporate new technologies on a cost effective or timely basis  which may result in unexpected expenses 
we may not anticipate technological or market trends accurately or manage long development cycles successfully 
we may be required to collaborate with third parties to develop products and may not be able to do so on a timely and cost effective basis  if at all 
the introduction of new or enhanced products also requires that we manage the transition from older products so as to minimize the disruption to customers and ensure that adequate supplies of new products can be delivered to meet anticipated customer demand 
if we are unable to develop new products or enhancements on a timely and cost effective basis  or if the new products or enhancements that we introduce fail to achieve market acceptance  our ability to grow our business would be harmed and competitors could achieve greater market share 
our revenue could decline significantly if we lose a major customer or if a major customer cancels  reduces or delays an order 
one customer accounted for more than of our revenue in each of and the loss of this or any other major customer or the cancellation  reduction or delay of significant orders from such customers  even if only temporary  could significantly reduce our revenue and cash flow and could harm our reputation in the industry 
our dependence on sole and single source suppliers and independent manufacturers could result in increased costs or delays in the manufacture and delivery of our products 
although we generally use standard parts and components for our products  some key components are purchased from sole or single source vendors for which alternative sources are not currently available or are difficult to obtain 
our inability to obtain sufficient quantities of these components may result in future delays or reductions in product shipments that could cause us to lose sales  incur additional costs and suffer harm to our reputation 
we currently purchase proprietary components from a number of suppliers for which there are no direct substitutes 
these components could be replaced with alternatives from other suppliers  but that might require redesign of our products 
if such a redesign were required  we would incur considerable delay and expenses 
we currently enter into purchase orders with our suppliers for materials based on forecasts of need  but have no guaranteed supply arrangements with these suppliers 
in addition  we currently use a number of independent manufacturers to manufacture printed circuit boards  chassis and subassemblies in accordance with our design and specification 
our reliance on independent manufacturers involves a number of risks  including the potential for inadequate capacity of  unavailability of  or interruptions in access to  process technologies  and reduced control over delivery schedules  manufacturing yields and costs 
if our manufacturers are unable or unwilling to continue manufacturing our components in required quantities or to our quality expectations  we will have to transfer manufacturing to acceptable alternative manufacturers that we have identified  which could result in significant delays in shipment of products to customers 
moreover  the manufacture of these components is extremely complex  and our reliance on the suppliers of these components exposes us to potential production difficulties and quality variations  which could negatively affect the cost and timely delivery of our products 
we currently enter into purchase orders with independent manufacturers of materials based on forecasts of need  but have no guaranteed arrangements with these manufacturers 
any significant interruption in the supply  or degradation in the quality  of any component could cause us to lose sales  incur additional costs and suffer harm to our reputation 
defects in our products or problems arising from the use of our products may seriously harm our business and reputation 
products as complex as ours may contain known and undetected errors  bugs  or other performance problems 
defects are frequently found during the period immediately following introduction and initial implementation of new products or enhancements to existing products 
although we attempt to resolve all bugs that we believe would be considered serious by our customers before implementation  our products may not be bug free 
we also provide warranties against defects in materials and workmanship on our hardware products for five years 
errors  bugs or performance problems  however  could result in lost revenue or customer relationships and could be detrimental to our business and reputation generally 
in addition  our customers generally use our products together with their own products and products from other vendors 
as a result  when problems occur  it may be difficult to identify the source of the problem 
these problems may cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs  divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems 
changes to regulations affecting the telecommunications or internet industries could reduce demand for our products or increase our costs 
laws and regulations governing telecommunications  electronic commerce and the internet are emerging  but remain largely unsettled  even in the areas where there has been some legislative action 
regulation may focus on  among other things  assessing access or settlement charges  or imposing tariffs or regulations based on the characteristics and quality of products  either of which could restrict our business or increase our cost of doing business 
any changes to existing laws or the adoption of new regulations by federal or state regulatory authorities or any legal challenges to existing laws or regulations relating to the telecommunications industry could materially adversely affect the market for our products 
moreover  our value added resellers or other customers may require  or we may otherwise deem it necessary or advisable  for us to alter our products to address actual or anticipated changes in the regulatory environment 
our inability to alter our products or address any regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or operating results 
limitations on our ability to adequately protect our proprietary rights may prevent us from retaining our competitive advantage and negatively affect our future operating results 
our success and ability to compete are dependent  in part  upon our proprietary technology 
taken as a whole  we believe our intellectual property rights are significant and any failure to adequately protect the unauthorized use of our proprietary rights could result in our competitors offering similar products  potentially resulting in loss of a competitive advantage and decreased revenue 
we rely upon a combination of patents  trademark law  trade secret protections  copyright law and confidentiality agreements with consultants and third parties to protect our proprietary rights 
notwithstanding our efforts  third parties may infringe or misappropriate our proprietary rights 
in addition  we generally require each of our employees to execute a proprietary information agreement designed to protect our trade secrets  our inventions created in the course of employment with us and other proprietary information of our company 
moreover  effective patent  trademark  copyright or trade secret protections may not be available in every country in which we operate or intend to operate to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
also  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy or reverse engineer aspects of our products  develop similar technology independently or otherwise obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
furthermore  detecting unauthorized use of our proprietary rights is difficult 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our proprietary rights 
such litigation could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources and could have a material adverse effect on our future operating results 
intellectual property claims against us can be costly and negatively affect our business 
in the telecommunications business  there is frequent litigation based on allegations of patent infringement 
as the number of entrants in our market increases and the functionality of our products is enhanced and overlaps with the products of other companies  we may become subject to claims of infringement or misappropriation of the intellectual property rights of others 
as a result  from time to time  third parties may claim exclusive patent or other intellectual property rights to technologies that we use 
although we believe that we do not face material liability related to infringement of the intellectual property of others  any claims asserting that our products infringe or may infringe proprietary rights of third parties  if determined adversely to us  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or operating results 
any claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  divert the efforts of our engineering and management personnel  cause delays in product shipments or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  any of which could have a material adverse effect upon our operating results 
if any legal action claiming patent infringement is commenced against us  we cannot assure you that we would prevail in such litigation given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in patent litigation 
in the event a claim against us was successful  and we could not obtain a license on acceptable terms or license a substitute technology or redesign to avoid infringement  we may be unable to market our affected products 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
certain of our products depend upon the continued availability of licensed technology from third parties 
we currently license and will continue to license certain technology integral to certain of our products from third parties 
for example  we have obtained licenses from third parties for software for certain of our voice and fax products 
while we believe that much of this technology is available from multiple sources  any difficulties in acquiring third party technology licenses  or integrating the related third party technology into our products  could result in delays in product development or upgrades until equivalent technology can be identified  licensed and integrated 
we may require new licenses in the future as our business grows and technology evolves 
we cannot assure you that these licenses will continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  if at all  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
if we are unable to attract or retain key personnel  we may be unable to operate our business successfully 
our success depends in large part upon the continued contributions of our key management  sales  marketing  and engineering personnel  many of whom perform important functions and would be difficult to replace 
if we lose one or more members of our senior management team our business and operating results would be harmed 
we do not have employment contracts with our key personnel 
there has been significant competition in our industry for qualified personnel  and  at times  we have experienced difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel 
we may not be able to attract and retain the necessary personnel to accomplish our business objectives  and we may experience constraints that will adversely affect our ability to satisfy customer demand in a timely fashion or to support our customers and operations 
our inability to hire qualified personnel on a timely basis  or to retain our key personnel  could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
our products typically have long sales cycles  causing us to expend significant resources before recognizing revenue 
the length of our sales cycle typically ranges from six to eighteen months and varies substantially from customer to customer 
prospective customers generally must commit significant resources to test and evaluate our products and integrate them into larger systems 
this evaluation period is often prolonged due to delays associated with approval processes that typically accompany the design and testing of new communications equipment by our customers 
in addition  the rapidly emerging and evolving nature of the markets in which we and our customers compete may cause prospective customers to delay their purchase decisions as they evaluate new technologies and develop and implement new systems 
during the period in which our customers are evaluating whether to place an order with us  we often incur substantial sales and marketing expenses  without any assurance of future orders or their timing 
even after a customer places an order  the timing of the development  introduction and implementation of the customer s product or service using our product is controlled by  and can vary significantly with the needs of  the customer 
in some circumstances  the customer will not require the product for several months 
this continuing uncertainty can complicate our planning processes and reduce the predictability of our earnings and cash flows 
our business and operating results could be adversely affected by downturns in economic conditions in countries outside the united states and other risks associated with international operations 
sales of our products to customers outside the united states accounted for of our revenue in we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue 
because of our dependence upon international sales  we are subject to a number of risks  including volatility in currency exchange rates  political and economic instability in other countries  the imposition of trade and tariff regulations by foreign governments  difficulties in accounts receivable collections  extended payment terms beyond those customarily offered in the united states  potentially adverse tax consequences  and the difficulties in managing operations across disparate geographic areas 
in addition  most countries require technical approvals from their telecommunications regulatory agencies for products that operate in conjunction with the local telephone system 
obtaining these approvals is generally a prerequisite for sales in a given jurisdiction 
obtaining requisite approvals takes from two months to a year or more depending on the product and the jurisdiction 
these or other factors may limit our ability to sell our products in other countries  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
we may seek to expand through acquisitions of complementary businesses  and we may not be able to successfully integrate acquired companies 
we may seek to acquire complementary companies in the future 
in addition to the difficulties we may face in identifying and consummating acquisitions  we will also be required to integrate and consolidate any acquired businesses or assets with our existing operations 
managing an acquired business entails numerous operational and financial risks  including difficulties in integrating disparate administrative  accounting and finance  and information systems  difficulties in assimilating acquired operations and new personnel  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  and potential loss of key employees or customers of any acquired operations 
accordingly  we may be unable to successfully identify  consummate and integrate future acquisitions or operate acquired businesses profitably 
our success will depend  to a significant extent  on the ability of our executive officers and other members of senior management to respond to these challenges effectively 
if we are unable to integrate successfully an acquired company  our future growth may suffer  and our results of operations could be harmed 
risks related to our financial results our operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly and cause our stock price to be volatile  which could cause the value of your investment to decline 
our operating results are likely to fluctuate in the future due to a variety of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
if our operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts  the trading price of our common stock could significantly decline 
this may cause the value of your investment in our company to decline 
in addition  the value of your investment could be affected by investor perception of our industry or our prospects generally  independent of our operating performance 
some of the factors that could affect our operating results or the market price of our common stock include our ability to cope with difficult conditions in the economy in general  and the telecommunications market in particular  our ability to formulate and implement effective strategies to respond to changing market requirements and conditions  cancellation or rescheduling of orders for our products  our ability to collect accounts receivable from customers that have been adversely affected by the difficult economic conditions  our ability to develop  manufacture  market and support our products and product enhancements  the timing and number of orders for our products  which have historically been weighted more heavily toward the last month of each quarter and the second and fourth quarters of each year  we typically experience lower revenue in the third quarter  due to customer summer vacation schedules  particularly in europe  and to a lesser extent  the first quarter of each year  our ability to hire  train and retain key management  sales  marketing and engineering personnel  announcements or technological innovations by our competitors or in competing technologies  our ability to obtain sufficient supplies of sole or limited source components for our products  a decrease in the average selling prices of our products  changes in costs of components that we include in our products  the mix of products that we sell and the mix of distribution channels through which they are sold  and a decrease in the demand for our common stock 
due to these and other factors  revenue  expenses and operating results could vary significantly in the future  and period to period comparisons should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
the market price of our common stock is volatile  which could lead to losses for individual investors 
stock markets in general  and the market for technology stocks  including our common stock  in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that often have been unrelated  or disproportionate  to the operating performance of those companies 
the market for our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile 
many factors could cause the trading price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially  including the following future announcements concerning our business  technology  acquisitions  strategic partnerships  management  customers or competitors  introduction of new products or changes in product pricing policies by us  our competitors or our customers  changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts or announcements of results of operations that are not aligned with the expectations of analysts and investors  changes in market valuations of similar companies  reduced spending for telecommunications hardware and software  the economic and competitive conditions in the telecommunications sectors in which our customers operate  and general economic conditions and stock market trends 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been brought against that company 
many technology companies have been subject to this type of litigation 
this type of litigation  if instituted against us  could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources 
our corporate documents may prevent a change in control or management that stockholders consider desirable 
our charter and by laws contain provisions that might enable our management to resist a takeover of our company 
in addition  our board of directors has adopted a shareholder rights plan 
these provisions and our shareholder rights plan could have the effect of delaying  deferring  or preventing a change in control of brooktrout or a change in our management that stockholders consider favorable or beneficial 
they could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions 
they also could limit the price that investors may be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
we may need additional financing in the future  and any additional financing may result in restrictions on our operations or substantial dilution to our stockholders 
we may need to raise additional funds in the future  for example  to develop new technologies  support our expansion  respond to competitive pressures  acquire complementary businesses or respond to unanticipated situations 
we may try to raise additional funds through public or private financings  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
our ability to obtain debt or equity funding will depend on a number of factors  including market conditions  our operating performance and investor interest 
additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to revise our business plan to reduce expenditures  including curtailing our growth strategies  foregoing acquisitions or reducing our product development efforts 
if we succeed in raising additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible securities  the issuance could result in substantial dilution to existing stockholders 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of debt securities or preferred stock  these new securities would have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
the terms of these securities  as well as any borrowings under our bank line of credit agreement  could impose restrictions on our operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest cash balances in excess of operating requirements in short term securities  generally with maturities of days or less on the date of purchase 
these securities consist of us government notes and bonds  commercial paper  and certificates of deposit 
we invest in marketable debt securities that consist of notes and bonds of various federal agencies  as well as corporate commercial paper  with maturities greater than days on the date of purchase 
if we were to experience a increase in the effective interest rate  the effect on the carrying value of marketable debt securities would be a decrease of  our securities are considered available for sale for accounting purposes and any unrealized gain or loss is deferred as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
in addition  our working capital line of credit provides for borrowings that bear interest at a variable rate equal to the lender s prime rate 
as of december   the company did not have any borrowings outstanding under this line of credit and was not exposed to market risk 
other than the issuance of letters of credit and using the credit line to secure immaterial foreign currency forward contracts  there have been no borrowings under the line during the past three years 
the line of credit expires on june  we anticipate that the line of credit will be renewed on substantially the same terms as the existing line of credit 
we believe that the effects  if any  of possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows will not be material 
the company generally conducts business denominated in us dollars 
we do  however  operate facilities overseas and we therefore also conduct some business in other currencies 
the impact of changes in currency rates on our consolidated results of operations has not been significant in any period presented 
substantially all of our revenue is denominated in us dollars  as are the significant majority of our expenses 
we manage our exposure to foreign currency market risks through regular operating and financing activities  and occasionally through the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
as of december   a appreciation or depreciation in foreign currency exchange rates from the prevailing market rates would have had an immaterial impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows  due to the relatively immaterial number of transactions occurring in currencies other than the us dollar
