our fiscal year ended on february  and contained weeks 
all references herein to fiscal relate to the weeks ending january  changes in accounting principle cooperative advertising allowances in november  the eitf reached consensus on issue  accounting by a customer including a reseller for cash consideration received from a vendor 
issue addresses the accounting for cash consideration received by a customer from a vendor eg  slotting fees  cooperative advertising payments  buydowns and rebates or refunds from a vendor that are payable only if the customer completes a specified cumulative level of purchases or remains a customer for a specified time period 
issue is effective for new arrangements or modifications to existing arrangements entered into after december   although early adoption is permitted 
we elected to adopt early  effective february   the provisions of issue in the preparation of this annual report on form k 
accordingly  in fiscal  we recorded a cumulative effect of accounting change of million  million net of income tax  for the impact of this adoption on prior fiscal years 
as of february   million of our cooperative advertising allowances has been deferred into inventory and will be recognized as inventory is sold 
this adoption has also resulted in the reclassification of our cooperative advertising payments earned in fiscal from selling  general  and administrative expense to cost of sales and occupancy expense retroactively as of the beginning of fiscal the fiscal impact on income before cumulative effect of accounting change was immaterial 
the following pro forma financial information for fiscal years and reflects the impact of issue as if it had been adopted prior to fiscal fiscal year as reported pro forma as reported pro forma in thousands except per share data net sales     cost of sales and occupancy expense   gross profit     selling  general  and administrative expense   store pre opening costs     litigation settlement   operating income     interest expense     other income and expense  net     income before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change provision for income taxes     income before cumulative effect of accounting change   cumulative effect of accounting change for revenue recognition  net of income tax of    net income     earnings per common share basic diluted selected balance sheet information merchandise inventories     retained earnings     custom frame sales effective october   we changed our method of accounting for custom frame sales in accordance with guidance provided in the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
historically  we recognized sales for custom frame orders at the time that the order was placed by the customer 
under the new accounting method adopted retroactive to january   we now effectively recognize revenue for custom frame orders at the time of delivery 
the cumulative effect of the change on prior years resulted in a charge to income of million after reduction for income taxes of million which is included in the results of operations for fiscal the effect of the change on fiscal was to recognize million in revenue and increase income before the cumulative effect of the accounting change by  results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationship to net sales of each line item of our consolidated statements of income 
this table should be read in conjunction with the following discussion and with our consolidated financial statements  including the related notes 
fiscal year net sales cost of sales and occupancy expense gross profit selling  general  and administrative expense store pre opening costs litigation settlements operating income interest expense other income and expense  net income before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change provision for income taxes income before cumulative effect of accounting change cumulative effect of accounting change for cooperative advertising allowances  net of income tax cumulative effect of accounting change for revenue recognition  net of income tax net income fiscal compared to fiscal net sales for fiscal increased million  or  over fiscal the results for fiscal included sales from michaels and aaron brothers stores that were opened during the year  more than offsetting lost sales from seven michaels and four aaron brothers store closures 
sales at the new stores  net of closures  during fiscal accounted for million of the increase in net sales 
comparable store sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal  which contributed million to the net sales increase 
the improvement in comparable store sales was due to a strong performance in our core categories of books  art supplies  kids crafts  framing  and seasonal 
cost of sales and occupancy expense  as a percentage of net sales  for fiscal was  a decrease of compared to fiscal this decrease was due in part to a reclassification of million  or of net sales  of fiscal cooperative advertising allowances from selling  general  and administrative expense in connection with our change in accounting policy 
in addition  this decrease as a percentage of net sales was due to improved merchandise margins and a leveraging of store occupancy expense on higher average net sales per store compared to fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a million markdown reserve to reflect the net realizable value of certain merchandise that did not conform to each store s specific planogram sku program 
as of the end of the second quarter of fiscal  essentially all of this merchandise had been liquidated and the related markdown reserve was fully utilized as part of the liquidation process 
selling  general  and administrative expense was million  or of net sales  in fiscal compared with million  or of net sales  in fiscal the increase as a percentage of net sales was due in part to a reclassification of million  or of net sales  of fiscal cooperative advertising allowances to cost of sales and occupancy expense in connection with our change in accounting policy 
this increase was partially offset by a leveraging of certain store and corporate expenses  which are fixed in nature  resulting from higher average net sales per store in fiscal compared with fiscal fiscal includes costs of approximately million related to executive severance 
furthermore  as a result of our adoption of the provisions of sfas no 
in the first quarter of fiscal  amortization expense decreased million in fiscal compared with fiscal see recent accounting pronouncements for an explanation of our adoption of the provisions of sfas no 
store pre opening costs  as a percentage of net sales  decreased from fiscal to fiscal in fiscal  we opened or relocated michaels and aaron brothers stores compared to michaels and aaron brothers stores in fiscal on june   we negotiated a settlement of the purported class action brought by one of our former assistant managers  taiyeb raniwala 
as a result  we recorded a litigation settlement charge of million in fiscal  covering all claims  attorneys fees  and estimated payroll taxes 
the settlement  in exchange for a full release of claims  received final approval from the court on november   and distribution of the settlement proceeds was made on january  on march   aaron brothers negotiated a settlement of the purported class action brought by suzanne collins  a former aaron brothers assistant manager 
as a result  aaron brothers recorded a litigation settlement charge of million in fiscal  covering all claims  attorneys fees  and estimated payroll taxes 
the settlement  in exchange for a full release of claims  received final approval from the court on june   and distribution of the settlement proceeds was made to the settlement administrator on august  operating income increased on a increase in net sales to million  or of net sales  in fiscal from million  or of net sales  in fiscal operating income for fiscal was positively impacted by sales growth of  the expansion of our gross margin  and leveraging our selling  general  and administrative costs 
operating income for fiscal was negatively impacted by a markdown reserve charge of million  executive severance costs of million  and litigation settlement charges of million 
interest expense net of interest income decreased to million  or of net sales  in fiscal from million  or of net sales  in fiscal  primarily due to a million charge recorded in fiscal in connection with the early extinguishment of our senior notes due and a decrease in interest expense for borrowings under the credit agreement 
borrowings under the credit agreement were outstanding for days with a average interest rate for fiscal compared to days with a average interest rate for fiscal in addition  in fiscal  we incurred million of incremental interest expense while the senior notes due and the senior notes due were both outstanding for a day period 
the above decreases from fiscal were partially offset by an increase in interest expense for fiscal due to the higher principal amount of the senior notes due compared to the senior notes due we changed our accounting policy with respect to recording cooperative advertising allowances effective retroactively as of the beginning of fiscal as a result  we recorded a non cash charge of million  net of income tax  in the first quarter of fiscal for the cumulative effect of the change on fiscal years prior to fiscal net income for fiscal increased to million  or per diluted share  from million  or per diluted share  for fiscal excluding the cumulative effect of accounting change with respect to cooperative advertising allowances  net income for fiscal was million  or per diluted share  an increase of from fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal net sales in fiscal increased million  or  over fiscal fiscal net sales includes a rd week totaling million 
excluding the rd week of net sales in fiscal  net sales in fiscal increased million  or  from fiscal the results for fiscal included sales from michaels and aaron brothers stores that were opened during the year  more than offsetting lost sales from eight michaels store closures 
sales at the new stores  net of closures  accounted for million of the increase in net sales 
comparable store sales  on a week basis  increased in fiscal compared to fiscal  which contributed million to the net sales increase 
the improvement in comparable store sales was due to a strong performance in our core categories of seasonal products as well as general crafts  framing  art supplies  and d cor accents 
cost of sales and occupancy expense  as a percentage of net sales  for fiscal was  a decrease of compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to lower fiscal seasonal inventory markdowns related to holiday clearance merchandise  partially offset by higher occupancy costs associated with new and relocated stores and higher utility costs 
in addition  we recorded a charge of million  or as a percentage of net sales  in the fourth quarter of fiscal to record a markdown reserve to reflect the net realizable value of certain merchandise that did not conform to each store s specific planogram sku program 
selling  general  and administrative expense remained relatively constant as a percentage of net sales in fiscal compared with fiscal fiscal selling  general  and administrative expense includes costs of million related to executive severance 
store pre opening costs  as a percentage of net sales  decreased by in fiscal compared to fiscal  as we opened or relocated michaels and aaron brothers stores in fiscal compared to michaels and aaron brothers stores in the prior fiscal year 
on june   we negotiated a settlement of the purported class action brought by one of our former assistant managers  taiyeb raniwala 
as a result  we recorded a litigation settlement charge of million in fiscal  covering all claims  attorneys fees  and estimated payroll taxes 
the settlement  in exchange for a full release of claims  received final approval from the court on november   and distribution of the settlement proceeds was made on january  on march   aaron brothers negotiated a settlement of the purported class action brought by suzanne collins  a former aaron brothers assistant manager 
as a result  aaron brothers recorded a litigation settlement charge of million in fiscal  covering all claims  attorneys fees  and estimated payroll taxes 
the settlement  in exchange for a full release of claims  received final approval from the court on june   and distribution of the settlement proceeds was made to the settlement administrator on august  operating income increased on a increase in net sales to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  even though operating income for fiscal was negatively impacted by a markdown reserve charge of million  executive severance costs of million  and litigation settlement charges totaling million 
interest expense  net of interest income  in fiscal was million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal on august   we redeemed our senior notes due in aggregate principal amount of million 
as a result  we recorded a loss from the early extinguishment of debt in the amount of million in the third quarter of fiscal fiscal expense includes incremental interest expense of million incurred while the senior notes due and the senior notes due were both outstanding for a day period during fiscal in addition  interest expense increased due to the increased principal amount of the senior notes due compared to the senior notes due  interest on higher outstanding borrowings against the credit agreement  and lower average cash balances during fiscal these increases in net interest expense were partially offset by interest savings of million related to the conversion and redemption of the convertible subordinated notes in june we changed our accounting policy with respect to revenue recognition related to the sale of custom frames effective retroactively as of the beginning of fiscal as a result  we recorded a non cash charge of million  net of income tax  in the first quarter of fiscal for the cumulative effect of the change on fiscal years prior to fiscal net income for fiscal increased to million  or per diluted share  from million  or per diluted share  for fiscal net income for fiscal increased from fiscal income before the cumulative effect of accounting change of million  or per diluted share 
liquidity and capital resources changes in cash and equivalents cash flow provided by operating activities in fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to an increase in the change in merchandise inventories and accounts payable of million and a decrease in the change in income taxes payable and accrued liabilities and other totaling million  partially offset by an increase of million in net income 
inventories per michaels store of million at february  increased from  at february  cash flow used in investing activities in fiscal was million compared to million during fiscal in fiscal  we incurred capital expenditures related to the completion of our new hazleton  pennsylvania distribution center  the expansion of our lancaster  california distribution center  the opening of michaels and aaron brothers stores  and the relocation of michaels and one aaron brothers store 
in addition  we received a landlord reimbursement in the amount of million for the expansion of our lancaster  california distribution center  which was completed in fiscal in fiscal  we incurred capital expenditures related to the construction of our new hazleton  pennsylvania distribution center  which was completed in fiscal  the opening of michaels and aaron brothers stores  and the relocation of michaels and five aaron brothers stores 
in fiscal  we received proceeds in the amount of million from the completion of a sale leaseback transaction for two distribution center properties which we purchased in december the following table sets forth capital expenditures fiscal year in thousands new and relocated stores and stores not yet opened   existing stores    distribution system expansion  net of landlord reimbursements  information systems    corporate and other    proceeds from sale leaseback transaction  we anticipate capital expenditures for fiscal to total approximately million 
in fiscal  we plan to open approximately michaels and aaron brothers stores and relocate michaels stores 
in addition  we plan to begin construction of a new distribution facility to be located in the chicago  illinois area  which we anticipate will be completed in fiscal and will replace our kentucky distribution center 
cash flow provided by financing activities in fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal cash provided by financing activities was higher in fiscal primarily due to the issuance of the senior notes due totaling million  net of expenses  partially offset by the early redemption of the senior notes due totaling million 
proceeds from the exercise of stock options were million for approximately million shares of our common stock in fiscal and million for approximately million shares of our common stock in fiscal bank credit facility effective may   we signed a new million unsecured revolving bank credit facility with fleet national bank and other lending institutions  which replaced the previous million unsecured revolving bank credit facility 
the credit agreement had an original term of three years with a maturity extension for one additional year available under certain conditions and contains a million competitive bid feature and a million letter of credit sub facility 
effective may   pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement  our lenders agreed to extend the term of the credit agreement from april  to april  we are in compliance with all terms and conditions of the credit agreement 
no borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement as of february  or february  borrowings available under the credit agreement are reduced by the aggregate amount of letters of credit outstanding under the credit agreement million as of february  and million as of april  
the following table sets forth certain data related to borrowings under our credit agreement and our previous million bank credit facility fiscal year days of borrowings outstanding average outstanding borrowings in thousands   weighted average interest rate equity on december   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of million shares of our outstanding common stock 
during fiscal  we repurchased and subsequently retired  shares of our common stock at an average cost of per share 
after the close of fiscal  we repurchased and subsequently retired  shares of our common stock at an average cost of per share 
as of april   we have repurchased and retired a total of million shares under the purchase plan at an average cost of per share  and  as a result  we have used the entire fixed portion of the authority originally provided in the repurchase plan 
the repurchase plan also provides that the proceeds of the exercise of options under our general stock option plan may be used to repurchase shares under the repurchase plan and that the maximum number of shares authorized to be repurchased under the repurchase plan will be increased to the extent necessary to so use the proceeds from such option exercises 
as of april   no repurchases from proceeds of stock option exercises under the general stock option plan had been made since no options outstanding under the general stock option plan had been exercised as of that date 
on september   our board of directors also authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of our outstanding common stock in addition to shares available for repurchase under the repurchase plan 
after the close of fiscal  we repurchased  shares of our common stock under the repurchase plan at an average cost of per share 
as of april   we have  shares of our common stock available for repurchase under the repurchase plan 
under the agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness  we can only repurchase shares of our common stock if we maintain or comply with specified financial ratios and other covenants 
we may also be restricted by regulations of the securities and exchange commission from making future repurchases during certain time periods 
proceeds from the exercise of outstanding stock options have served as a source of cash for us  and we expect to receive proceeds from the exercise of outstanding stock options and options to be granted under our stock option plans in the future 
proceeds from the exercise of stock options were million in fiscal and million in fiscal proceeds from the exercise of stock options under our general stock option plan are required to be used to repurchase shares of our own common stock under the repurchase plan  except where not permitted by law or there is a compelling need to use the proceeds for other corporate purposes 
in october  we began issuing our common stock through our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan  which provides owners of shares of our common stock with a convenient and economical means of purchasing our common stock 
we may establish a discount of to in certain transactions to purchase shares under the plan 
the amounts issued under this plan during fiscal   and were not material 
in october  we began issuing our common stock through our employees stock purchase plan  which provides our employees with a convenient and economical means of purchasing our common stock 
the amounts issued under this plan during fiscal   and were not material 
prior to october  shares for the employees stock purchase plan were acquired through open market purchases 
debt in july  we issued million in principal amount of senior notes due july  in a private placement under securities and exchange commission rule a to a limited number of qualified institutional buyers 
the senior notes due are unsecured and interest thereon is payable semi annually on each january and july  beginning on january  in october  as required by the contract with the purchasers of the senior notes due  we completed a registered exchange of all the privately placed senior notes due for an equal principal amount of senior notes due having substantially identical terms 
on august   we used a portion of the proceeds of the senior notes due offering described above to redeem our senior notes due  of which million aggregate principal amount was then outstanding 
the redemption price was  per  principal amount of the senior notes due  plus accrued interest to august  we incurred a loss from the early extinguishment of debt in the amount of million in fiscal general we require cash principally to finance capital investments  inventory for new stores  and for seasonal working capital needs 
we opened michaels and aaron brothers stores in fiscal and stores in fiscal  and relocated michaels and aaron brothers stores in fiscal and stores in fiscal in recent years  we have financed our operations and new store openings primarily with cash from operations  and borrowings under our credit agreement 
we currently estimate that our capital expenditures will be approximately million in fiscal we anticipate spending approximately million to open approximately new michaels and new aaron brothers stores  million for store relocations and improvements in existing stores  million for new and existing distribution centers  million on information systems projects  million on corporate expansion  and million for various other capital investment activities 
we expect to spend on average approximately million to open a new michaels store  which includes  in net inventory and  of pre opening costs and  to open a new aaron brothers store  which includes  in net inventory and  of pre opening costs 
we anticipate that our new michaels stores  as a group  will become profitable within the first months of operation of each store 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we entered into an agreement to purchase our new midwest distribution center once construction is completed 
the estimated purchase price is million 
we believe that our available cash  funds generated by operating activities  funds available under the credit agreement  and proceeds from the exercise of stock options will be sufficient to fund anticipated capital expenditures  working capital requirements  and any stock repurchases for the foreseeable future 
critical accounting policies we have prepared our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  and these financial statements necessarily include some amounts that are based on our informed judgments and estimates 
our senior management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates  and the disclosure in this section of this report regarding them  with the audit committee of our board of directors in connection with our fiscal year end close 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies are subject to judgments and uncertainties  which affect the application of these policies 
as discussed below  our financial position and results of operations may be materially different when reported under different conditions or when using different assumptions in the application of these policies 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual amounts  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
our critical accounting policies include merchandise inventories we value our inventories at michaels stores at the lower of cost or market as determined using a retail inventory method 
because we do not have perpetual inventory records for inventory in our michaels stores  we are required to perform complete physical inventories for a significant sample of stores at the end of each fiscal quarter to estimate ending inventories valued at retail for all michaels stores 
our sampling process is designed to count a selection of stores  which are representative of the size  age  and geographic location of the entire chain of stores 
an actual physical count of merchandise is made by third party inventory counting service firms in substantially every store each fiscal year 
we believe our sampling process results in reasonable estimates of our retail inventory on hand at period end 
additionally  in determining our cost of goods sold and ending inventory at cost  we utilize a single pool of inventory for our michaels stores inventories 
at this time  we have no formal plans to move to a single pool for each of our stores or departmental pools to determine cost of sales and ending inventory  however  we may do so in the future as further enhancements are made to our inventory systems in connection with our efforts to move toward having store level perpetual inventory capabilities 
our success in managing our inventories is dependent on our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing customer demand and preferences for products and supplies used in creative activities 
if we misjudge the market  we may significantly overstock unpopular products and be forced to take significant inventory markdowns 
permanent markdowns are recorded in the period in which management determines that markdowns will need to be taken to sell certain merchandise 
prior to fiscal  markdowns were generally determined based on sample retail counts of the affected merchandise on hand 
beginning in fiscal  markdowns are determined based on a sample of stores perpetual inventory records 
these markdowns are estimates  which could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual requirements if future economic conditions or competitive conditions differ from our expectations 
goodwill we have made acquisitions in the past that included a significant amount of goodwill 
under generally accepted accounting principles in effect through fiscal  goodwill was amortized over its estimated useful life  and was tested periodically to determine if it was recoverable from operating earnings on an undiscounted basis over its useful life 
beginning in fiscal  goodwill is no longer amortized but is subject to an annual or  under certain circumstances  more frequent impairment test based on the estimated fair value of our reporting units with goodwill 
estimated fair value is typically less than values based on undiscounted operating earnings because fair value estimates include a discount factor in valuing future cash flows 
there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment loss 
another estimate using different  but still reasonable  assumptions could produce a significantly different result 
to date  we have not experienced any impairment of our goodwill  however  there can be no assurance that future impairment will not result should our operating results deteriorate for reasons such as those described under risk factors herein 
reserve for closed facilities we maintain a reserve for future rental obligations  carrying costs  and other closing costs related to closed facilities  primarily closed and relocated stores 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 through the end of the third quarter of fiscal  our accounting policy was to record reserves for these obligations when management committed to closing or relocating a store or facility 
beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 costs associated with disposal activities  and began recognizing exit costs for any store closures not already identified and recorded by the end of the third quarter of fiscal at the time the store is closed 
as of february   we have a liability totaling million  of which million has been recorded for stores to be closed after the end of fiscal while the adoption of sfas no 
does not change our policy for calculating store closure reserves  it does change the timing of the recognition of the related expense in future periods 
the cost of closing a store or facility is calculated as the sum of the lesser of future rental obligations remaining under the lease less estimated sublease rental income or the lease termination fee and the net book value of the assets located in the closed store or facility that are not reused in another store or facility less estimated asset resale income 
the determination of the reserves is dependent on our ability to make reasonable estimates of costs to be incurred post closure and of sublease rental income to be received from subleases 
the reserves could vary materially if market conditions were to vary significantly from our assumptions 
the following is a detail of account activity related to closed facilities in thousands fiscal year balance at beginning of fiscal year    additions charged to costs and expenses    payment of rental obligations and other    balance at end of fiscal year    stock based compensation we have elected to follow apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related guidance in accounting for our employee stock options 
the exercise price of our employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant and  as a result  we do not recognize compensation expense for stock option grants 
pro forma information regarding net income and earnings per common share  as required by the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  has been determined as if we had accounted for our employee stock options under the fair value method 
for purposes of pro forma disclosures  the estimated fair value of the options is amortized over the options vesting periods 
our pro forma information is as follows fiscal year in thousands except per share data net income  as reported    stock based employee compensation cost as if fair value method were applied  net of income tax  pro forma net income    earnings per common share  as reported basic diluted pro forma earnings per common share basic diluted the fiscal net income amount includes the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle  net of income tax  related to cooperative advertising allowances 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the fiscal net income amount includes the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle  net of income tax  related to custom framing sales recognition 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
seasonality our business is highly seasonal  with higher sales in the third and fourth fiscal quarters 
for the last six fiscal years  our fourth quarter  which includes the christmas selling season  has accounted for approximately of our sales and approximately of our operating income 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  as an amendment to sfas no 
and to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
our policy is to account for stock based employee compensation using the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb opinion no 
prior to the adoption of the provisions of sfas no 
 we reported the pro forma effect of the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation under the provisions of sfas no 
we have adopted the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
in the preparation of this annual report on form k 
while this adoption does not change our policy of accounting for stock based employee compensation using the intrinsic value method  we have more prominently disclosed our stock based employee compensation as part of our significant accounting policies in note of notes to consolidated financial statements and have revised our presentation format of the pro forma effect of the fair value method of accounting 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
sfas no 
addresses the accounting and financial statement classification for gains and losses related to the extinguishment of debt and the accounting for certain lease modifications and makes various technical corrections to existing pronouncements 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after may  we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
in fiscal and  as a requirement under those provisions  we reclassified the million charge million after tax taken in fiscal in connection with the early extinguishment of our senior notes due from extraordinary loss  net of income tax  to interest expense and the provision for income taxes on the consolidated statements of income 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  under the provisions of sfas no 
and no 
 goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests 
other intangible assets with finite useful lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
we adopted these provisions in the first quarter of fiscal we have performed the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  and the tests have not resulted in an impairment charge 
the following pro forma financial information reflects net income and diluted earnings per common share as if goodwill were not subject to amortization in fiscal and fiscal year in thousands except per share data net income  as reported    add back goodwill amortization  net of income taxes   pro forma net income    pro forma earnings per common share basic diluted risk factors our growth depends on our ability to open new stores our key business strategy is to expand our base of michaels and aaron brothers stores 
if we were unable to implement this strategy  our ability to increase our sales  profitability  and cash flow could be impaired significantly 
to the extent that we are unable to open new stores as we anticipate  our sales growth would come only from increases in comparable store sales 
growth in profitability in that case would depend significantly on our ability to reduce our costs as a percentage of our sales 
we may be unable to implement our strategy if we cannot identify suitable sites for additional stores  negotiate acceptable leases  access sufficient capital to support store growth  or hire and train a sufficient number of qualified associates 
our success will depend on how well we manage our growth even if we are able to implement  to a significant degree  our key business strategy of expanding our store base  we may experience problems  which may prevent any significant increase in profitability or negatively impact our cash flow 
for example the costs of opening and operating new stores may offset the increased sales generated by the additional stores  the closure of unsuccessful stores may result in the retention of liability for expensive leases  a significant portion of our management s time and energy may be consumed with issues unrelated to advancing our core business strategy which could possibly result in a deterioration of our operating results  our expansion may outpace our planned technological advances with the possible consequences of breakdowns in our supply chain management and reduced effectiveness of our operational controls  we may be unable to hire and train qualified managers and other associates  our suppliers may be unable to meet the increased demand of additional stores in a timely manner  and we may be unable to expand our existing distribution centers or use third party distribution centers on a cost effective basis to provide merchandise for sale by our new stores 
we may be unsuccessful in our implementation of our perpetual inventory and automated replenishment systems we are in the process of rolling out a perpetual inventory system  which we believe is extremely important in the management of a large retail chain offering thousands of products 
in conjunction with our perpetual inventory system  we are implementing an automated inventory replenishment system that we believe is necessary to improve store in stock positions and better forecast and manage inventory levels and merchandise ordering quantities for our growing number of stores 
delays in bringing these new systems on line  or disruptions from an imperfect introduction of these new systems  could have a materially adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results 
improvements to our supply chain may not be fully successful an important part of our efforts to achieve efficiencies  cost reductions  and sales and cash flow growth is the identification and implementation of improvements to our supply chain  including merchandise ordering  transportation  and receipt processing 
significant changes to our supply chain could have a materially adverse impact on our operating results 
we may fail to anticipate customer demands our success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing customer demand and preferences for products and supplies used in creative activities 
if we misjudge the market  we may significantly overstock unpopular products and be forced to take significant inventory markdowns  which would have a negative impact on our operating results and cash flow 
conversely  shortages of key items could have a materially adverse impact on our operating results 
our suppliers may fail us many of our suppliers are small firms that produce a limited number of items 
given their limited resources  these firms are susceptible to cash flow issues  production difficulties  quality control issues  and problems in delivering agreed upon quantities on schedule 
we cannot assure you that we would be able  if necessary  to return product to these suppliers and obtain refunds of our purchase price or obtain reimbursement or indemnification from them if their products prove defective 
in addition  these suppliers may be unable to withstand a downturn in economic conditions 
significant failures on the part of our key suppliers could have a materially adverse affect on our operating results 
in addition  many of these suppliers require extensive advance notice of our requirements in order to supply products in the quantities we desire 
this long lead time requires us to place orders far in advance of the time when certain products will be offered for sale  exposing us to shifts in demand 
risks relating to foreign suppliers we rely to a significant extent on foreign manufacturers of various products that we sell 
in addition  many of our domestic suppliers purchase a portion of their products from foreign sources 
this reliance increases the risk that we will not have adequate and timely supplies of various products due to local political  economic  social  or environmental conditions  transportation delays  restrictive actions by foreign governments  or united states laws and regulations affecting imports 
reliance on foreign manufacturers also increases our exposure to fluctuations in exchange rates and trade infringement claims and reduces our ability to return product for various reasons 
all of our products manufactured overseas and imported into the united states are subject to duties collected by the united states customs service 
we may be subjected to additional duties  significant monetary penalties  the seizure and the forfeiture of the products we are attempting to import  or the loss of import privileges if we or our suppliers are found to be in violation of us laws and regulations applicable to the importation of our products 
our information systems may prove inadequate we depend on our management information systems for many aspects of our business 
we will be materially adversely affected if our management information systems are disrupted or we are unable to improve  upgrade  maintain  and expand our systems  particularly in light of our continued significant increases in the number of stores 
a weak fourth quarter would materially adversely affect our operating results our business is highly seasonal 
our inventories and short term borrowings  if any  grow in the second and third fiscal quarters as we prepare for our peak selling season in the third and fourth fiscal quarters 
our most important quarter in terms of sales  profitability  and cash flow historically has been the fourth fiscal quarter 
if for any reason our fourth fiscal quarter results were substantially below expectations  our operating results for the full year would be materially adversely affected  and we could have substantial excess inventory  especially in seasonal merchandise that is difficult to liquidate 
competition could negatively impact our operations the retail arts and crafts industry is competitive  which could result in the reduction of our prices and our loss of market share 
we must remain competitive in the areas of quality  price  breadth of selection  customer service  and convenience 
our primary competition is comprised of specialty arts and crafts retailers  which include hobby lobby  ac moore arts crafts  inc  jo ann etc 
operated by jo ann stores  inc  and garden ridge corporation 
we also compete with mass merchants  who dedicate a portion of their selling space to a limited selection of craft supplies and seasonal and holiday merchandise  regional chains  and local merchants 
some of our competitors  particularly the mass merchants  are larger and have greater financial resources than we do 
in addition  alternative methods of selling crafts  such as over the internet  could result in additional competitors in the future and increased price competition since our customers could more readily comparison shop 
furthermore  we ultimately compete with alternative sources of entertainment and leisure for our customers 
the amount of debt we have could adversely affect us by reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions our needs for cash in the future will depend on many factors that are difficult to predict  including our results of operations and efforts to expand our existing operations 
we believe  based on current circumstances  that our cash flow from operations  together with available borrowing under our bank credit facility  and proceeds from the exercise of stock options  will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
however  we cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow at or above current levels 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to repay our debt as it becomes due and make necessary investments  we may be required to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our existing debt  seek new borrowings  reduce or delay capital expenditures  sell assets  seek additional equity capital  or delay  scale back  or eliminate some aspects of our operations  including delaying our plans for new store openings 
moreover  it is possible that we may not be able to satisfy all of the conditions and covenants of our debt 
in addition  to the extent we seek to replace or refinance our current debt  replacement financing may not be available on terms that are favorable to us 
in addition  we may not be able to obtain acceptable financing upon the expiration of our bank credit facility 
our ability to obtain additional or replacement financing will be significantly impacted by  among other things  any changes in the ratings assigned to us by nationally recognized ratings agencies 
any of these events  if they were to occur  could have a materially adverse affect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
the covenant restrictions in our debt restrict our operations we and our subsidiaries are subject to significant operating and financial restrictions contained in the instruments governing the senior notes due and our other indebtedness 
those restrictions affect  and in many respects significantly limit or prohibit  among other things  our ability to incur additional indebtedness  make various investments  issue or sell our restricted subsidiaries capital stock  engage in transactions with affiliates  make various distributions  sell or securitize accounts receivable  provide negative pledges  make capital expenditures beyond specific limitations  engage in derivative transactions other than in the ordinary course of business  create various liens  or merge  consolidate  and sell assets 
in addition  our credit agreement requires us to maintain specified financial ratios 
these restrictions could also limit our ability to obtain financing in the future  make needed capital expenditures  withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general  or conduct necessary corporate activities 
if we or our subsidiaries fail to comply with these restrictions  we may be in default under the terms of our indebtedness  even if we are otherwise able to meet our debt service obligations 
in the event of a default  the holders of the indebtedness could elect to declare all of that indebtedness  together with accrued interest  to be due and payable and a significant portion of our other indebtedness may become immediately due and payable as a result of cross default clauses contained in documentation evidencing debt 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to make those payments or borrow sufficient funds from alternative sources to make those payments 
even if we were to obtain additional financing  that financing may be on terms unfavorable to us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest cash balances in excess of operating requirements primarily in money market mutual funds and short term interest bearing securities  generally with maturities of days or less 
the fair value of our cash and short term investment portfolio at february  approximated carrying value 
the interest rates on our revolving line of credit are repriced frequently  at market rates  which would result in carrying amounts that approximate fair value 
we had no borrowings outstanding under the line of credit at february  we believe that the effect  if any  of possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows would not be material 
the fair value of our senior notes due was estimated to be million at february   which was million greater than carrying value 
generally  the fair value of our fixed interest rate long term debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
market risk was estimated as the potential increase in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical decrease in the interest rates used by the dealers to quote the fair value of our long term debt at february   which would result in an increase in fair value of approximately million 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the table below presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates of our long term debt at february   by year of maturity dollars in thousands fiscal year thereafter long term debt  weighted average interest rate
