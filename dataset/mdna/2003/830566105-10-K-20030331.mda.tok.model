overview we design  market and sell contemporary footwear for men  women and children under the skechers brand 
our footwear is sold through a wide range of department stores and leading specialty retail stores  a growing network of our own retail stores and our e commerce website 
our objective is to continue to profitably grow our domestic operations  while leveraging our brand name to expand internationally 

table of contents we generate revenues from three principal sources and have the following reportable segments wholesale 
we sell footwear directly to department stores and specialty retail stores both domestically and internationally 
retail 
we own and operate our own retail stores both domestically and  on a smaller scale  internationally through three integrated retail formats 
our three distinct retail formats are as follows concept stores 
our concept stores are located in marquee street locations and high performing regional malls  promote awareness of the skechers brand and showcase a broad assortment of our in season footwear styles 
the products offered in our concept stores are full price in season products and typically attract fashion conscious customers 
our proto typical concept store is approximately  square feet and generates gross margins that are the highest of our three retail formats 
factory outlet stores 
our factory outlet stores are generally located in manufacturers outlet centers and provide opportunities to sell an assortment of in season  discontinued and excess merchandise at lower price points 
our factory outlet stores range in size from  square feet to  square feet and generally have price points less of or lower 
gross margins generated from our factory outlet stores are less than those in our concept stores 
warehouse outlet stores 
our freestanding warehouse outlet stores appeal to our most value conscious customers and enable us to liquidate excess merchandise  discontinued lines and odd size inventory in a cost efficient manner 
our warehouse outlet stores are typically located in manufacturers direct outlet centers throughout the us these stores allows us to sell discontinued and excess merchandise  thereby reducing the need to sell merchandise to discounters at excessively low prices  which could compromise the skechers brand 
distributors 
internationally  we sell our footwear to our foreign distributors who distribute such footwear to department stores and specialty retail stores in europe  asia  latin america  south america and numerous other countries and territories 
approximately  and of our net sales were derived from our domestic wholesale segment for the years ended december    and  respectively 
typically  our retail sales achieve higher gross margins as a percentage of net sales than domestic wholesale sales 
sales through foreign distributors result in lower gross margins as a percentage of net sales than retail or wholesale sales 
none of our domestic retail sales formats  international wholesale sales  international retail sales  or international distributor sales comprised more than of our consolidated net sales for either fiscal  or we have implemented a strategy of controlling the growth of the distribution channels through which our products are sold in order to protect the skechers brand name  properly secure customer accounts and better manage the growth of the business 
we seek wholesale accounts that we believe can best support the skechers brand name in the market as part of our efforts to expand our wholesale distribution 
we seek to selectively open retail stores in high profile  high traffic locations in major metropolitan areas both domestically and internationally 
domestically  we are currently planning to open approximately to retail stores during fiscal as compared to in fiscal we seek to increase the number of international wholesale accounts that we sell directly to  thereby reducing our reliance on foreign distributors and we anticipate opening two to four international retail stores in  one of which was opened in manchester  england in february we have realized rapid growth since inception  increasing net sales from million in to million in however  during our revenues declined when compared to  due to the economic slowdown in both the us and in some international countries where our product is distributed and from the elimination of our mail order sales 
also  based on our current estimates  we currently anticipate sales levels during the first quarter of to be to lower than sales during the first quarter of we currently expect sales for the first six months of to be lower than sales in the comparable period in we currently anticipate sales for the second half of to be higher than the second half of these estimates may be affected by a number of factors within and out of our control  including but limited to  the continued threat of terrorist attacks throughout the world  the war with iraq  and any additional military action taken  or contemplated  by the united states and other nations that could cause additional significant disruption to commerce throughout the world 
as our sales growth accelerated  we focused on investing in our infrastructure to support continued expansion in a disciplined manner 
the infrastructure additions are included in both selling and general and administrative type expenses 
during and  we expanded our administrative facilities  hired additional personnel  developed product sourcing and quality control offices in china and taiwan  upgraded our management information systems  opened additional retail stores  established an internally managed distribution center in belgium  expanded our international direct selling efforts by establishing subsidiaries in the united kingdom  
table of contents france  germany  spain  switzerland  canada  the netherlands  and in march in italy 
not all of the fixed costs incurred during this expansion period have been leveraged over a full year s sales 
we established this infrastructure to achieve economies of scale in anticipation of continued increases in sales 
because expenses relating to this infrastructure are fixed  at least in the short term  operating results and margins would be adversely affected if we do not achieve our anticipated sales growth 
for example  during the fourth quarter of  we saw a de leveraging of our expenses as sales declined when compared to the fourth quarter of we anticipate additional de leveraging of our costs as we currently expect first quarter sales to be to lower than sales in the first quarter of our gross margins during fiscal decreased to compared to in during the fourth quarter ended december   our gross margins were compared to in the fourth quarter ended december  given the continuing weak retail environment  we currently anticipate that margins during the first half of fiscal will be lower than those in the first half of operating margin as a percentage of net sales decreased from in  to in  and to in in addition  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we realized our first quarterly loss  since becoming a public company in june  of million compared to net income of million in the fourth quarter of increasing sales and maintaining or improving gross margins and operating margins depends on various factors  including  strength of our brand name  competitive conditions and our ability to efficiently manage sales through all distribution channels 
in the future  sales and earnings growth will be dependent upon  among other things  the continued success of our efforts to expand our footwear offerings within the skechers brand or developing alternative  successful brands 
we can not assure you that the rate of growth will not continue to decline in future periods or that we will improve or maintain gross margins or operating margins 
notwithstanding our net loss during the fourth quarter  and the anticipated results for the first quarter of  we remain committed to the overall marketing strategy that has been largely responsible for the increase in the development of the skechers brand of products 
we have and continue to adjust our advertising budget based on projected sales  which has included such avenues as magazines  television  trade shows  radio spots  billboards  and buses 
we endeavor to spend approximately to of annual net sales in the marketing of skechers footwear through advertising  promotions  public relations  trade shows and other marketing efforts 
we believe that selective licensing of the skechers brand name to non footwear related manufacturers may broaden and enhance the skechers image without requiring us to expend significant capital investments or incur significant incremental operating expenses 
although we have licensed certain manufacturers to produce and market certain skechers products on a limited basis  to date we have not derived any significant royalty income from these licensing arrangements 
royalty income is recognized as revenue when earned and is offset by related expenses 
during  we entered into three licensing arrangements  within the apparel and accessories market  for socks and hosiery items  watches  and children s apparel  and in march  we signed an additional licensing agreement  to compliment our skechers collection product line  for outwear 
although licensing royalties may increase in dollar value on a go forward basis  we do not anticipate that they will become a significant portion of our consolidated net sales 
we contract with third parties for the manufacture of all our products 
we do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities 
in  the top four suppliers of our products accounted for of our total purchases  and one vendor accounted for over of our purchases 
to date  substantially all products are purchased in us dollars  but this may not continue to be the case 
we believe the use of independent manufacturers increases our production flexibility and capacity yet at the same time allows us to substantially reduce capital expenditures and avoid the costs of managing a large production work force 
substantially all of our products are produced in china 
we finance our production activities in part through the use of interest bearing open purchase arrangements with certain of our asian suppliers 
these facilities currently bear interest at a rate between and with financing for to days 
we believe that the use of these arrangements affords us additional liquidity and flexibility 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net sales net sales for decreased to million compared to million in the decrease in net sales was primarily due to reduced domestic wholesale segment sales which were million for  compared to million in the decrease in the domestic wholesale segment sales during was primarily due to decreases in both the men s and women s lines  partially offset by increases in our kids lines  and sales from the skechers work line launched in  and to a lesser extent  the wheelers line started in the third quarter of domestic wholesale segment volume decreased to million pairs in from million pairs in distributor net sales decreased primarily due to decreased sales into the south american market place 
international wholesale net sales increased in compared to the increase was primarily due to our direct 
table of contents sales efforts in place for the full year in compared to approximately nine months in domestic retail sales increased in over  due to the addition of retail stores added during international retail sales increased due to most stores being opened the entire months period in  compared to only a portion in  and to a lesser extent  new flagship stores opened in frankfurt  germany and toronto  canada during the fourth quarter of our direct mail sales decreased over  in compared to due to the elimination of our mail order and catalog operations in october during  we continued to expand internationally by establishing subsidiaries in canada  spain  the benelux region  and in the first quarter of  in italy 
our international subsidiary s infrastructure typically includes a sales and support staff and showroom to present the full range of our product offerings to prospective accounts 
we continuously evaluate international regions where we can profitably transition our business model 
we also anticipate opening two to four international retail stores in  one of which was opened in manchester  england in february during the year ended december   we opened domestic retails stores five concept stores  five warehouse outlet stores  and three factory outlet stores 
we anticipate opening approximately to domestic retail stores during  five of which have already been opened to date 
gross profit gross profit for was compared to gross profit of million in gross margin was for compared to for gross margin for the domestic wholesale segment was in compared to in the decrease in gross margin in the domestic wholesale segment was due primarily to concessions given to our wholesale accounts to stimulate sales at retail during this sluggish retail environment  additional costs related to the domestic west coast port strike which lead to additional airfreight costs from our international manufacturers  rerouting of freight to east coast and canadian ports  and the subsequent trucking costs from those ports to our distribution center in ontario  california 
in addition we realized lower margins from our company owned retail stores due to additional sales promotions during compared to selling expenses selling expenses for the were million compared to million in  a decrease of million or 
selling expense as a percentage of net sales decreased to compared to in the decrease in selling expense was primarily due to decreased advertising  which was of sales in compared to in advertising reductions were realized from fewer domestic print ads  and cable tv ads  other selling expense reductions were derived from reduced commissions  samples  and reductions in general and point of purchase promotional items 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for were million compared to million for as a percentage of net sales general and administrative expenses were in  compared to in the increase in general and administrative expenses during compared to was due to increased rent approximately million and depreciation charges approximately million related to the addition of retail stores and the full year s effect of the stores added in  infrastructure additions to support our direct selling efforts in the united kingdom  germany  france  and new subsidiaries added in  including spain  canada  and the netherlands and  to a lesser extent  legal reserves and the move into our internally managed distribution center in liege  belgium in the fourth quarter of however  the expense increases noted were partially offset by reduced temporary help costs approximately million at our distribution facility in ontario  california 
the costs added during this expansion period have not been leveraged over a full year s sales 
we established this infrastructure to achieve economies of scale in anticipation of continued increases in sales 
because expenses relating to this infrastructure are fixed  at least in the short term  operating results and margins would be adversely affected if we do not achieve our anticipated sales growth 
interest expense interest expense decreased to million in compared to million in the decrease is due to the elimination of our short term borrowings whose interest rate was tied to the prime rate of interest  which has decreased over the last two years and reduced interest rates charged on amounts outstanding with our foreign manufacturers 

table of contents other income other income for was million compared to million in the slight increase in other income was due to foreign exchange gains  offset by decreased rent revenue from the leasing of office space at one of our administrative facilities 
income taxes the effective tax rate in was compared to in the decrease in the effective tax rate is due to changes in income in differing tax jurisdictions as a result of our international expansion 
we are expanding our international operations and plan to reinvest any undistributed earnings from our non us subsidiaries  thereby indefinitely postponing their remittance 
as a result  we do not plan to provide for deferred income taxes on any accumulated undistributed earnings that our non us subsidiaries earn in the future 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net sales net sales for increased to million compared to million in the increase in net sales was due to an increase in domestic wholesale segment sales of million in to million  compared to million in the increase was due to increased sales in all product lines  primarily women s sport and kids lines  the introduction of three new product lines during  and additional styles added within each product line 
domestic wholesale volume increased to million pairs in from million pairs in domestic retail sales increased over levels largely due to the addition of retail stores during net sales from our direct mail and web based distribution channels remained consistent in as compared to however  in october  we elected to discontinue our mail order and catalog operations  which represented less of net sales in  although we continue to offer a selected assortment of merchandise through our interactive website 
during  total international sales increased over levels 
international sales consist of distributor sales  which increased due to continued acceptance of our product offerings in the international marketplace 
international wholesale revenues increased substantially from nominal levels in due to marketing and advertising campaigns in support of the establishment of our three international subsidiaries located in the united kingdom  france and germany  where we began to sell direct to department stores and specialty retailers in during  we generated our first international retail sales as we opened our first three international flagship retail stores located in the united kingdom  france and germany 
gross profit gross profit for was million  an increase of over million in gross margin was for compared to for gross margins for the domestic wholesale segment was in compared to in the slight margin increase in the domestic wholesale segment was the result of reduced cargo costs partly offset by reduced margins during the three months ended december  for price concessions given to our wholesale customers 
also  offsetting the slight increase to gross margins were price reductions at our factory outlet and warehouse outlet stores to help stimulate inventory sell through at the retail level 
selling expenses selling expenses for were million  an increase of over last year s million 
selling expenses as a percent of net sales increased slightly to from in the increase in the level of spending was primarily due to increased advertising in both print and television media and additional advertising to support the increase in sales activities in the united kingdom  germany and france where we commenced selling direct to department stores and specialty retailers 
during advertising expenses were million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales in general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for were million compared to million in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was in compared to in the increase in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales was due to planned infrastructure additions to support the domestic retail stores added during and to establish operating entities  and flagship retail stores  in the united kingdom  
table of contents france and germany to support our direct selling efforts in those countries 
in addition  we increased our distribution capacity with facility and capital asset additions and enhanced our information systems to support the increase in sales volume 
interest expense interest expense increased to million in from million in the increase was due to increased short term borrowings to support our working capital requirements and retail store additions and increased capital asset financing to support the increase in sales volume and capacity expansion 
other income other income increased to million in compared to  in the increase in other income is due to rental income related to the leasing of offices at our administrative office building and legal settlements  partially offset by the disposal of fixed assets 
we expect rental income to decrease during as tenant leases expire 
income taxes the effective tax rate in was compared to in the decrease in the effective tax rate is due to changes in income in differing tax jurisdictions as a result of our international expansion 
we are expanding our international operations and plan to reinvest any undistributed earnings from our non us subsidiaries  thereby indefinitely postponing their remittance 
as a result  we do not plan to provide for deferred income taxes on any accumulated undistributed earnings that our non us subsidiaries earn in the future 
liquidity and capital resources our working capital at december  was million  an increase of million from million at december  the increase in working capital was primarily due to the elimination of our short term borrowings of approximately million with a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of million of long term convertible subordinated notes in april in addition to refinancing our short term borrowings  we increased our cash balances by million in our working capital increase was offset by an million decrease in receivables primarily attributed to reduced wholesale sales of approximately million during the fourth quarter ended december  and a million increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was approximately million  compared to cash used in operating activities of million for the year ended december  the decrease in sales in over and especially the fourth quarter of as compared to the fourth quarter of  resulted in a decrease of million in our investment in accounts receivable and inventories compared to a corresponding build up of million of these accounts in the prior year 
we experienced an increase in net sales of million in over  which drove the increase in accounts receivable and inventories in as a consequence of these trends  we were able to generate million in operating cash flow 
as a result of our improved operating cash flow and million in reduced capital expenditures  we were able to refinance all of our short term borrowings of million with the issuance of million of convertible subordinated notes due in april  and generate available borrowings under our line of credit of million at december  net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was due to reduced capital expenditures requirements resulting from fewer retail store openings in than in  in compared to in  and prior year investing activities including the acquisition of real properties in manhattan beach  california 
we anticipate an increase cash used in investing activities during  compared to  due to our current forecast of to domestic retail store additions and two to four international retail store additions in in  we have already opened one international retail store and four domestic retail stores 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in cash provided by financing activities was due to the reduction of net financing derived from our short term borrowings  which was repaid with a portion of the proceeds from the issuance of our convertible subordinated notes issued in april  and reduced use of the line of credit facility due to increased cash flows provided by operating activities of million and to lesser extent  the reduction in capital expenditures from a decrease in store openings 

table of contents in april  we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due april  the notes are convertible into shares of our class a common stock 
interest on the notes is paid semi annually on april and october of each year  which commenced october  the notes are convertible at the option of the holder into shares of class a common stock at a conversion rate of shares of class a common stock per  principal amount of notes  which is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share 
the conversion rate is subject to adjustment 
the notes may be converted at any time on or before the close of business on the maturity date  unless the notes have been previously redeemed or repurchased  provided  however  that if a note is called for redemption or repurchase  the holder will be entitled to convert the notes at any time before the close of business on the date immediately preceding the date fixed for redemption or repurchase  as the case may be 
the notes are unsecured and subordinated to our present and future senior debt 
the notes are also structurally subordinated in right of payment to all indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries 
the indenture does not restrict our incurrence of indebtedness  including senior debt  or our subsidiaries incurrence of indebtedness 
net proceeds from the sale of the notes were million 
the refinancing of our short term borrowings with long term capital was done to provide us with long term capital to provide for the future growth of the business 
in july  we renegotiated our line of credit facility  which now provides for borrowings of up to million  with actual borrowings limited to available collateral and certain limitations on total indebtedness approximately million of availability as of december  with the cit group  as agents for the lenders 
at december   no amounts were outstanding under the revolving line of credit 
the revolving line of credit bears interest at prime rate at december  minus 
interest on the line of credit is payable monthly in arrears 
the revolving line of credit expires on december  the revolving line of credit provides a sub limit for letters of credit of up to million to finance our foreign purchases of merchandise inventory 
as of december   we had approximately million of letters of credit under the revolving line of credit 
the credit facility provides that stockholders equity shall not decrease by more than in any calendar quarter  contains a tangible net worth requirement  as defined in the agreement  and limits the payment of dividends if we are in default of any provision of the agreement 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of december  we believe that anticipated cash flows from operations  available borrowings under our revolving line of credit  cash on hand  proceeds from the issuance of the notes and our financing arrangements will be sufficient to provide us with the liquidity necessary to fund our anticipated working capital and capital requirements through fiscal however  in connection with our growth strategy  we will incur significant working capital requirements and capital expenditures 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including  but not limited to  the levels at which we maintain inventory  the market acceptance of our footwear  the success of our international expansion  the levels of promotion and advertising required to promote our footwear  the extent to which we invest in new product design and improvements to our existing product design and the number and timing of new store openings 
to the extent that available funds are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financing 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available or that  if available  it can be obtained on terms favorable to our stockholders and us 
failure to obtain such financing could delay or prevent our planned expansion  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  if additional capital is raised through the sale of additional equity or convertible securities  dilution to our stockholders could occur 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
the company derives its revenue from the sale of footwear 
in general  revenue is recognized upon shipment of the merchandise 
domestically  goods are shipped directly from our domestic distribution center in ontario  california  and revenue is recognized upon shipment from the distribution center fob shipping point 
for our international wholesale accounts  product is shipped direct from our distribution center in liege  belgium  and revenue is recognized upon shipment from the distribution center 
for our distributor sales  the goods are delivered directly from the independent factories to the distributors on an fob shipping point basis and revenue is recognized upon shipment from the factory 
in all of the above cases  each of the following have been met prior to revenue recognition persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
use of estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
specifically  management must make estimates in the following areas allowance for bad debts  returns  and customer chargebacks 
we insure selected customer account balances both greater than  and accepted by the insurance company should our customer not pay 
we also provide a reserve against our receivables for 
table of contents estimated losses that may result from our customers inability to pay  and disputed and returned items 
we determine the amount of the reserve by analyzing known uncollectible accounts  aged receivables  economic conditions in the customers country or industry  historical losses and our customers credit worthiness 
amounts later determined and specifically identified to be uncollectible are charged or written off against this reserve 
to minimize the likelihood of uncollectibility  customers credit worthiness is reviewed periodically based on external credit reporting services and our experience with the account and adjusted accordingly 
should a customer s account become past due  we generally place a hold on the account and discontinue further shipments to that customer  minimizing further risk of loss 
the likelihood of a material loss on an uncollectible account would be mainly dependent on deterioration in the overall economic conditions in a particular country or environment 
reserves are fully provided for all probable losses of this nature 
gross trade accounts receivable balance was million and the allowance for bad debts  returns  and customer chargebacks was million at december  inventory adjustments 
inventories are stated at lower of cost or market 
we review our inventory on a regular basis for excess and slow moving inventory based on prior sales and net realizable value 
a write down of inventory is considered permanent and creates a new cost basis for those units 
the likelihood of any material inventory write down is dependent primarily on consumer demand and competitor product offerings 
inventories were stated at million at december  valuation of intangible and other long lived assets 
when circumstances warrant  we assess the impairment of intangible and other long lived assets that require us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying value of these assets 
the assets are considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon our assessment of the following events or changes in circumstances the asset s ability to continue to generate income  loss of legal ownership or title to the asset  significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the asset s  or the impact of significant negative industry or economic trends if the assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment we recognize is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
in addition  we base the useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used by us 
if a change were to occur in any of the above mentioned factors or estimates  the likelihood of a material change in our reported results would increase 
litigation reserves 
estimated amounts for claims that are probable and can be reasonably estimated are recorded as liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
the likelihood of a material change in these estimated reserves would be dependent on new claims as they may arise and the favorable or unfavorable outcome of the particular litigation 
both the amount and range of loss on the remaining pending litigation is uncertain 
as such  we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from unfavorable outcomes in litigation 
as additional information becomes available  we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates 
such revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operation and financial position 
valuation of deferred income taxes 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
the likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of these assets depends on future taxable income  and the effectiveness of our tax planning and strategies among the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
inflation we do not believe that the relatively moderate rates of inflation experienced in the united states over the last three years have had a significant effect on our sales or profitability 
however  we cannot accurately predict the effect of inflation on future operating results 
although higher rates of inflation have been experienced in a number of foreign countries in which our products are manufactured  we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our sales or profitability 
while we have been able to offset our foreign product cost increases by increasing prices or changing suppliers in the past  we cannot assure you that we will be able to continue to make such increases or changes in the future 
exchange rates 
table of contents we receive us dollars for substantially all of our product sales and our royalty income 
inventory purchases from offshore contract manufacturers are primarily denominated in us dollars  however  purchase prices for our products may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the local currencies of the contract manufacturers  which may have the effect of increasing our cost of goods in the future 
during and  exchange rate fluctuations did not have a material impact on our inventory costs 
we do not engage in hedging activities with respect to such exchange rate risk 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we do not hold any derivative securities 
market risk is the potential loss arising from the adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
changes in interest rates and  in the future  changes in foreign currency exchange rates have and will have an impact on our results of operations 
interest rate fluctuations 
at december   no amounts were outstanding that were subject to changes in interest rates  however  the interest rate charged on our line of credit facility is based on the prime rate of interest and changes in the prime rate of interest will have an effect on the interest charged on outstanding balances 
no amounts are currently outstanding 
foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
we face market risk to the extent that changes in foreign currency exchange rates affect our non us dollar functional currency foreign subsidiary s assets and liabilities 
in addition  changes in foreign exchange rates may affect the value of our inventory commitments 
also  inventory purchases of our products may be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rates between the us dollar and the local currencies of the contract manufacturers  which could have the effect of increasing cost of goods sold in the future 
we manage these risks by primarily denominating these purchases and commitments in us dollars 
we do not engage in hedging activities with respect to such exchange rate risks
