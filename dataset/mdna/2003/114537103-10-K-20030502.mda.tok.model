item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting estimates preparation of the company s financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the company reviews its estimates on an ongoing basis and makes judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities based on a number of factors 
these factors include historical experience  guidance provided by outside experts and assumptions made by management that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the most significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates are described below 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue from sales of merchandise at the time of customer receipt 
for its direct to customer segment  the company recognizes the revenue from these sales on the third business day after shipment as a result of delivery time 
revenue is recognized net of estimated merchandise returns and allowances 
inventory reserves 
the company maintains information about its merchandise performance at the item level 
this level of detail enables the management team to assess the viability of each item and to estimate the company s ability to sell through each item 
the company recognizes the write down of slow moving or obsolete inventory in cost of sales when the write down is probable and estimable 
management s estimates can be affected by many factors  some of which are outside the company s control  which include but are not limited to  consumer buying trends and general economic conditions 
the company takes a physical inventory at least twice a year at its retail store locations and distribution center 
the second of these inventories is conducted near the end of the fiscal year 
the company maintains a reserve for inventory shrinkage for the periods between physical inventories 
management establishes this reserve based on historical results of previous physical inventories  shrinkage trends or other judgments that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
deferred tax assets 
the carrying value of the company s net deferred tax assets assumes that the company will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets resulting in income tax expense in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assesses the need for valuation allowances periodically 

table of contents valuation of long lived assets 
the company reviews long lived assets for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
each impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted net cash flows of individual stores  and consolidated net cash flows for long lived assets not identifiable to individual stores  to the recorded value of the asset 
significant judgments are made in projecting future cash flows and are based on a number of factors  including the maturity of the store  historical experience  recent trends and general economic assumptions 
if impairment is indicated  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value on a discounted cash flow basis 
while the company believes that its estimates of future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially affect the company s evaluations 
pension and other post retirement benefit plans 
the company sponsors defined benefit pension and other post retirement benefit plans 
major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  rate of increase in employee compensation levels and health care cost increase projections 
assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators  and are evaluated each year as of the plans measurement date 
a change in any of these assumptions would have an effect on net periodic pension and post retirement benefit costs reported in the consolidated financial statements 
deferred catalog costs 
the company accounts for the costs associated with the production and distribution of its catalogs over the life of the catalog which is estimated to be six months 
these costs are amortized over the life of the catalog based on the estimated sales curve over this time frame 
workers compensation insurance 
the company retains risk with respect to workers compensation claims up to a maximum of  per claim and  on aggregate claims during the policy year 
the provision for estimated workers compensation claims includes estimates of the ultimate costs for both reported claims and claims incurred but not reported 
these estimates incorporate the company s past experience as well as other considerations

seasonality the seasonal nature of the company s business increased in fiscal and is expected to continue to increase in fiscal as the company opens additional retail stores and continues its program to operate a significant number of small  temporary locations during the winter holiday selling season 
in fiscal  most of the company s new stores were opened in the second half of the fiscal year 
the company s sales in the second fiscal quarter are generally higher than sales during the first and third quarters as a result of sales in connection with father s day 
the fourth fiscal quarter  which includes the winter holiday selling season has historically produced a disproportionate amount of the company s net sales and all of its income from operations 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources during fiscal  the company generated a total of million of cash including million from operations and million from the exercise of stock options 
in addition  the company s working capital decreased approximately million principally due to the increase in other current liabilities  primarily due to increased income taxes payable due to higher pre tax income in fiscal and increased compensation payable in as a result of fiscal s improved financial performance

at the end of fiscal  the company s cash position decreased to million  a million decrease from the end of the prior fiscal year 
the company s primary short term liquidity needs consist of financing seasonal merchandise inventory build ups 
the company s primary sources of financing for such needs are from operations  borrowings under its revolving credit facility and trade credit 
the company typically has no borrowings under the revolving credit facility from january through august  however borrowings typically increase from september through november to finance purchases of merchandise inventory in advance of the winter holiday selling season 
the company generally repays all outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility prior to christmas and relies on cash from operations obtained during the winter holiday selling season until it begins to borrow again under its revolving credit facility the following fiscal year 
at february  and february   the company had no outstanding borrowings under its revolving credit facility  although certain letters of credit in an aggregate amount of approximately million and million were outstanding  respectively 
during fiscal and  the company s borrowings peaked at million and million under the revolving credit facility  respectively 
additionally  the maximum amount outstanding during fiscal and still would have allowed the company to borrow an additional million and million  respectively under the borrowing base calculation as defined in the revolving credit facility 
the company s revolving credit facility provides for borrowings of up to million for letters of credit and working capital as long as the company meets a borrowing base test equal to of the amount of eligible inventory and outstanding documentary letters of credit increasing to june through july and to august through november 
amounts available for borrowings are reduced by the aggregate amount of outstanding 
table of contents letters of credit  which may not exceed million  and borrowings 
the facility requires the company to have no borrowings excluding letters of credit outstanding for at least consecutive days during the period of december  to april  thereafter  during the december th to april th time frame  the company must have no more than million in borrowings excluding letters of credit outstanding for consecutive days 
borrowings under the facility bear interest that is dependent on the level of the company s fixed charge coverage ratio 
depending on the calculated ratio of the company s fixed charge coverage  there are four different levels that have different fees and different margin rates on the applicable borrowings 
under the facility  the interest rates on the facility  at the company s option  were either the agent bank s base lending rate plus   or  or the eurodollar rate for the applicable period plus   or 
in addition  the company is obligated to pay a fee of   or on the unused portion of the commitment     or on the documentary letters of credit and   or on the standby letters of credit 
amounts due under the facility are secured by the personal property of the company  tangible or intangible including all stock of brookstone  inc s subsidiaries  but excluding real property  machinery and equipment encumbered on february   and general intangibles 
the security interest in the facility is subject to collateral release conditions dependent upon four consecutive quarters fixed charge coverage ratio of to and consolidated ebitda for the four quarters then ended of at least million 
at the lender s option  all positive cash balances held by the lender s banks may be applied to the outstanding balance of the revolving line of credit 
the facility contains a number of restrictive covenants  including limitations on incurring additional indebtedness  granting liens  selling assets  engaging in mergers and other similar transactions  engaging in new business lines and making capital expenditures 
in addition  the facility prohibits the payment of cash dividends on common stock and requires that the company maintain certain financial ratios  including tests pertaining to consolidated net worth  fixed charge coverage and cash flow leverage 
this facility has a term that expires february   although it contains an option to extend for one additional year 
for all four quarters of fiscal  the company was in compliance with these covenants 
lower market interest rates and plan asset returns have resulted in declines in pension plan asset performance and funded status 
the discount rate used for the calculation of plan liabilities at year end was lowered to reflecting current economic conditions 
the expected long term rate of return for fiscal year will be versus the fiscal year rate of 
the rate was developed by examining historical return rates based on plans asset allocation and other factors 
as a result  pension expense in is expected to be negatively impacted 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the company has never paid a cash dividend and currently plans to retain any earnings for use in the operations of the business 
any determination by the board of directors to pay future cash dividends will be based upon conditions then existing  including the company s earnings  financial condition and requirements  restrictions in its financing arrangements and other factors

borrowing under the company s amended credit agreement may also be limited by the following factors inventory obsolescence issues resulting from decreased revenues  that would affect the borrowing base assets  as eligible inventory in the borrowing base would decrease borrowings under the agreement are limited to a borrowing base calculation which may impact the ability of the company to fund its business the agreement contains a number of restrictive covenants 
if the company fails to meet any of these covenants  it may severely limit the company s ability to conduct its business the agreement contains a requirement for the company to have no more than million in borrowings for thirty consecutive days between the december th and april th timeframe 
failure to do so may severely limit the company s ability to borrow under its credit facility 
fiscal store openings and capital expenditure expectations the following discussion includes certain forward looking statements of management s expectations for store growth and related capital expenditures 
these statements should be read in light of the considerations presented under the caption outlook important factors and uncertainties found on pages of this document 

table of contents the company expects to add approximately to new brookstone stores  including up to nine airport locations and up to two gardeners eden retail stores  in fiscal the company anticipates the cost of opening a new brookstone store based on the new store design  including leasehold improvements net of landlord allowances  furniture and fixtures  and pre opening expenses  to average approximately  and a gardeners eden store to average approximately  in addition  the company expects a new brookstone store to require  and a gardeners eden new store to require  of working capital per store 
the company anticipates the cost of opening airport stores  including leasehold improvements  furniture and fixtures  and pre opening expenses  to average approximately  and expects airport stores to require  of working capital per store 
the company expects to identify between and stores for remodeling  and update and maintain other stores  during fiscal  incurring capital expenditures of approximately million 
the company plans to operate approximately seasonal stores during the fiscal winter holiday season subject to the availability of acceptable sites 
after a comprehensive review of the company s anticipated distribution requirements for the next five years  management has decided to physically expand its current distribution center in mexico  missouri by an incremental  square feet of high bay  high density space 
this additional space will replace up to approximately  square feet of un racked space 
this un racked space is covered under several short term leases and temporary seasonal rental arrangements 
phase i of this expansion was initiated in fiscal through the enhancement of the warehouse management system to increase the efficiency of receiving and shipping goods 
phase ii will consist of the physical expansion of the distribution center to occur in fiscal the company also anticipates completing phase iii of the expansion in fiscal during phase iii  the company will replace its current material handling system inside the distribution center with a state of the art materials handling system to further enhance productivity by increasing automation and reducing the amount of physical handling of product 
the company anticipates expending approximately million on the phase ii expansion and plans on financing this expansion 
these costs are expected to be partially offset by rent savings on leased space and production efficiencies 
in addition to the capital expenditures listed above  the company anticipates making capital expenditures of approximately million in fiscal  primarily to enhance the company s management information and other support systems 
in fiscal  the company expects to open most of its new stores in the second half of the year 
the company s retail operations are not generally profitable until the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 

table of contents outlook important factors and uncertainties the private securities litigation reform act of the act provides a safe harbor for forward looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information about themselves without fear of litigation so long as the forward looking information is accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statement 
statements in this annual report on form k which are not historical facts  including statements about the company s or management s confidence or expectations  seasonality of the company s future sales and earnings  plans for opening new stores and other retail locations  introduction of new or updated products  opportunities for sales growth or cost reductions and other statements about the company s operational outlook  are forward looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to vary materially 
the following are important factors  among others  that should be considered in evaluating these forward looking statements  as well as in evaluating the company s business prospects generally concentration of sales in winter holiday season 
a high percentage of the company s annual sales and all or substantially all of its annual income from operations have historically been attributable to the winter holiday selling season 
in addition  like many retailers  the company must make merchandising and inventory decisions for the winter holiday selling season well in advance of actual sales 
accordingly  unfavorable economic conditions and or deviations from projected demand for products during this season could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations for the entire fiscal year 
while the company has implemented certain measures to improve its results during periods outside of the winter holiday selling season  such as the opening of stores in airports and the development of gardeners eden stores  the company expects that its annual results of operations will remain dependent on the company s performance during the winter holiday selling season 
dependence on innovative merchandising 
successful implementation of the company s merchandising strategy depends on its ability to introduce in a timely manner new or updated products which are affordable  functional in purpose  distinctive in quality and design and not widely available from other retailers 
if the company s products or substitutes for such products become widely available from other retailers especially department stores or discount retailers  demand for these products from the company may decline or the company may be required to reduce their retail prices 
a decline in the demand for  or a reduction in the retail prices of  the company s important existing products can cause declines in the company s sales and profitability if the company is unable to introduce in a timely fashion new or replacement products of similar sales levels and profitability 
even with innovative merchandising  there remains a risk that the products will not sell at planned levels 

table of contents product risks 
although the company seeks to maintain quality standards at a high level  its products may have defects that could result in high rates of return  recalls or product liability claims 
such returns  recalls or claims could adversely affect profitability 
third parties may assert claims for patent or trademark infringement  or violation of other proprietary rights 
if successful  such claims could result in the inability to sell a particular product or  in the case of a settlement or royalty  adversely impact the profitability of the product 
such claims could entail significant legal expenses even if they are ultimately determined to be meritless 
gardeners eden stores 
the gardeners eden stores represent an initiative by the company to develop a new store model focused on a market that is different from that of the traditional brookstone store  and to help decrease the concentration of sales in the winter holiday season by generating more sales in the spring and summer 
the success of this new model could vary based on a wide variety of factors including the selection of optimum locations  innovative merchandising  increasing profitability  accurate prediction of customer response in a new market  and the overall condition of the economy 
new stores and temporary locations 
the company s ability to open new stores  including airport locations and the new gardeners eden concept stores  and to operate its temporary location program successfully depends upon  among other things  the company s capital resources and its ability to locate suitable sites  negotiate favorable rents and other lease terms and implement its operational strategy 
in addition  because the company s store designs must evolve over time so that the company may effectively compete for customers in top malls  airports and other retail locations  actual store related capital expenditures may vary from historical levels and projections based thereon due to such factors as the scope of remodeling projects  general increases in the costs of labor and materials and unusual product display requirements 
competition 
the company faces intense competition for customers  personnel and innovative products 
this competition comes primarily from other specialty retailers  department stores  discount retailers and direct marketers  including internet sites 
many of the company s competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing and other resources than the company 
retention of qualified employees 
the company s success depends upon its ability to attract and retain highly skilled and motivated  full time and temporary associates with appropriate retail experience to work in management and in its stores and temporary locations 
further  because of the limited time periods during which temporary locations are open each year  the availability of suitable associates for such locations is limited 
seasonal fluctuation of operating results 
the company s quarterly results of operations fluctuate based upon such factors as the amount and timing of sales contributed by new stores  the success of its temporary location program  capital expenditures and the timing of catalog mailings and associated expenses 

table of contents terrorism 
the federal government terror alerts have a negative effect on retail sales as they cause a disruption of consumer shopping patterns 
the company s stores are located predominantly in large public areas such as malls and airports  which experience a significant decrease in traffic during periods of high alert 
the company s stores are dependent on pedestrian traffic for sales volume 
terror alerts and acts of terrorism that affect such traffic could have an adverse impact on sales 
poor economic conditions 
the company s business has in the past and may be impacted by economic conditions that tend to reduce the level of discretionary consumer spending 
these conditions include high interest rates  inflation  unemployment  stock market uncertainty  and low consumer confidence 
information and communications infrastructure 
the success of the company is dependent upon its computer hardware and software systems  and its telecommunications systems 
the internet portion of the direct marketing business relies heavily on the proper operation of these systems  as well as on the continued operation of the external components of the internet  to market goods and to receive and process orders 
the retail business utilizes point of sale computers located in the stores 
the company s headquarters and distribution center rely on a wide variety of applications to carry on the business 
these systems are subject to damage from natural disasters  power failures  hardware and software failures  security breaches  network failures  computer viruses and operator negligence 
the company is also dependent on certain vendors of its key information systems 
should these vendors experience financial difficulties  the support of these key systems could be negatively impacted 
centralized distribution 
the company conducts all of its distribution operations and a significant portion of its direct marketing processing functions from multiple facilities in mexico  missouri and through a third party distribution center for its internet operation 
a disruption in operations at the distribution center or its third party distributor may significantly increase the company s distribution costs and prevent goods from flowing to stores and customers 
the company utilizes third party carriers for its product shipments 
the distribution of products is vulnerable to disruption from employee strikes and labor unrest  in particular  potential strikes by ups employees and or longshoremen  which could increase costs and impede or restrict the supply of goods 
direct marketing 
the success of the company s catalog operation hinges on the achievement of adequate response rates to mailings  merchandising and catalog presentation that appeal to mail order customers  and the expansion of the potential customer base in a cost effective manner 
lack of consumer response to particular catalog mailings could increase the costs and decrease the profitability of the direct marketing business 
significant costs relative to paper  postage and inventory are associated with the direct marketing business 
rising paper and postal rates can negatively impact the business and the failure to accurately predict consumer response or to achieve the optimum cost effective level of catalog circulation could adversely affect revenues and growth of the business 

table of contents dependence on key vendors 
because the company strives to sell only unique merchandise  adequate substitutes for certain key products may not be widely available in the marketplace 
because of this  there can be no assurance that vendor manufacturing or distribution problems  or the loss of the company s exclusive rights to distribute important products  would not have a material adverse effect on the company s performance 
in fiscal  the company had one vendor who supplied products representing approximately of net sales  with the largest vendors representing approximately of net sales 
the company s operating results could be adversely affected if any of its largest vendors were unable to continue to fill the company s orders for such vendor s products or failed to fill those orders in a timely way 
foreign vendors 
the company is purchasing an increasing portion of its merchandise from foreign vendors 
although management expects this strategy to increase profit margins for these products  the company s reliance on such vendors subjects the company to associated legal  social  political and economic risks  including import  licensing and trade restrictions 
in addition  the company is highly dependent upon steamship lines and air cargo companies to transport this merchandise from overseas to the united states and as such  the company remains vulnerable to equipment shortages and labor stoppage 
in such a situation  the company could face inventory shortages in certain products  increased transportation costs and increased interest expense as a result of moving inventory receipts forward 
increased petroleum prices 
in recent years  increases in petroleum prices have resulted in increased transportation and shipping costs for the company 
further increases in petroleum prices  or failure of such prices to decline  could continue to increase the company s costs for transportation and shipping and also cause increases in the cost of goods that are manufactured from plastics and other petroleum based products 
increased reliance on e commerce 
as a greater proportion of the company s sales are made via the internet  and as the company begins to look more to that channel to increase overall sales  the company will become increasingly subject to the uncertainties inherent in the quickly developing area of e commerce 
such uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the extent to which the company s customers will adopt the internet as their method of purchase  the effect that government regulation of the internet or lack thereof will have on the internet as a medium of commerce 
airline travel 
a significant portion of the company s sales is generated at its airport store locations 
additionally  the company markets a wide range of products attractive to the traveling public 
a decrease in traffic due to war  terrorism  health epidemics or the consolidation of the airline industry caused by merger and bankruptcy and the consequent reduction of flights and available destinations could negatively affect the volume of business at the company s airport store locations and could depress the sales of travel related merchandise 

table of contents health epidemics 
the outbreak of unexpected disease threats such as severe acute respiratory syndrome sars  influenza  and insect borne diseases such as encephalitis and the west nile virus could negatively impact the company s sales 
travel restrictions to certain parts of the world could impair the company s activities with some of its vendors that could result in product shortages and could slow new product development 
additionally  any reduction in travel could depress sales at the company s airport locations and reduce sales of its travel related merchandise 
curtailment of outdoor activities in response to the threat of insect borne illnesses could shrink sales of the company s recreational  garden  and outdoor products 
fear of contagion could cause a drop in traffic at all of its store locations with a consequent drop in sales
