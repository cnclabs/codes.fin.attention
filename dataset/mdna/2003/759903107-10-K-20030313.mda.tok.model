review of significant accounting policies in response to a guidance document that was recently issued by the securities and exchange commission  the company completed a review of its significant accounting policies  including those listed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the results of the review indicated that the accounting policies that the company has adopted are appropriate for the operations of the company and that the company has correctly applied the accounting policies 
management s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  if any exist 
the company evaluates its estimates  on an on going basis  including those related to inventories  investments  assets held for sale  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  bad debts  product returns  long lived assets and contingencies  if any 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values and disclosure o f amounts recorded or disclosed in the consolidated financial statements of the company 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
policies related to items that are not considered to be material to the consolidated financial statements are not discussed in detail here  but the policies applicable to these items are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition generally  revenues from the sale of products and services are recognized when products are shipped or services are provided  and the collection of such amount is considered probable 
if the company has unfulfilled obligations under the purchase orders  such as acceptance by the customer  revenue is deferred until such obligations are satisfied  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
inventory obsolescence slow moving inventory is reviewed monthly and the company writes off or establishes reserves for excess or obsolete inventories based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions and historical obsolescence data 
if actual future market conditions are less favorable than those forecasted by management  additional inventory write downs may be recorded 
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amounts that are more likely than not to be realized in the future 
the company and its subsidiary  as of december   had carried back all eligible operating losses 
at a time in the future when profits exceed cumulative losses  the company will be able to realize tax benefits and the applicable reduction in the valuation allowance will be credited to income in the period that the tax benefit is realized 
long lived assets the company evaluates the recoverability of its long lived assets when indications of impairment exist by recognizing impairment of long lived assets in the event the net book value of such assets exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets 
if such assets are considered impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
marketable securities the company owns certain marketable equity securities and records a provision  as a separate component of stockholders equity  to adjust the values of such securities to the quoted market price at each balance sheet date 
the company records an investment impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
other the company establishes allowances or reserves for bad debts  warranty obligations  product returns  and foreign currency gains or losses  and the impact of these items is generally immaterial to the consolidated financial statements because the amounts of the reserves and allowances have been  in the past  and are currently estimated to be  immaterial as they relate to the applicable assets or liabilities and the consolidated financial position of the company 
results of operations overview reliability s principal business is designing  manufacturing  and marketing high performance equipment used to condition and test integrated circuits and providing conditioning and test services to manufacturers and large users of integrated circuits 
the company s business depends significantly on capital equipment expenditures of ic manufacturers and overall demand for products utilizing ics 
the semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and the company is experiencing the effects of the current downturn 
the global economy remains weak and market conditions continue to be challenging 
individuals and companies continue to delay or reduce expenditures 
as a result  semiconductor industry revenues have declined from to and semiconductor capital equipment expenditures have declined over this same period 
softening demand for the company s products and services caused by this ongoing downturn has significantly contributed to decreases in revenues and earnings 
managem ent continues to review expenses and take actions to control cost  including the restructuring of the power sources segment and company wide reductions in staffing levels 
despite these challenging times  the company continues to invest in its future via capital asset investments and research and development in order to position the company for growth when its markets recover 
net revenues revenues for each of the company s three operating segments declined in the year ended december  due in large part to a sharp semiconductor market downturn during and a continuing global economic slowdown 
revenues for the test and conditioning products segment declined as a result of reduced demand for the company s criteria and intersect products 
reduced capital spending by the company s customers  dram overcapacity  reductions in burn in times by a major customer of the company s criteria products  and reduced demand for new criteria systems during and  partially offset by an increase in demand for upgrades to existing installed systems  have adversely affected this segment s revenues 
revenues in the services segment declined during fiscal   and the decrease in demand for the services provided by the company s singapore subsidiary are largely the result of dram overcapacity due to the sharp industry downturn  competitive price pressures in an overcapacity market  the loss of a new customer that relocated its production from singapore in  and significant reductions in burn in times and a move away from conventional burn in by a major customer during revenues in the power sources segment declined due to softening demand for products sold by the telecommunications and computer industries and competitive price pressures in a challenging market 
gross profit gross profit gp consists of net revenues less the cost of the materials  labor and operations overhead used in producing the products and providing the services supplied by the company 
gross profit decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal each of the company s three operating segments experienced a decline in gross profit as a result of fixed overhead cost increasing as a percentage of revenues  due to an overall decline in revenues and volumes during and additionally  changes in product mix and competitive price pressures  particularly in the services and power sources segments  have unfavorably affected gp 
marketing  general and administrative marketing  general and administrative mg a expenses primarily consist of employee salaries and payroll related costs  product promotion and customer support costs  employee and independent sales representative commissions  and legal  accounting and other professional services 
mg a decreased million or  in fiscal expense reductions are largely the result of cost controls and reductions in personnel  resulting in a decrease in payroll cost of 
million in fiscal additionally  certain revenue related marketing costs such as warranty reserves  installation cost  and commissions decreased 
million as a result of lower revenues 
for  mg a expenses decreased by million compared to fiscal year lower expenses are primarily the result of a million decrease in incentive bonuses and a million decrease in certain revenue related marketing costs  such as installation and commissions 
research and development research and development r d consists primarily of salaries and payroll related costs of employees involved in ongoing product research  design and development activities  engineering supplies  and professional contract design services 
the company s r d expense was million for fiscal compared to million in and million in r d expenses declined during as a result of a 
million reduction in professional contract design expenses and a 
million reduction in payroll  resulting from reductions in personnel 
a significant portion of the company s r d expenditures in  and the increase in  is associated with the development activities in the test and conditioning products segment  including the development of the criteria  the company s next generation micrologic test during burn in platform which was introduced in july of  and incremental improvements to the existing criteria product line 
additionally  the company increased its r d expenditures for development on new models of power sources during fiscal and by and  respectively 
the company anticipates that it will continue to have significant research and development expenditures in the future to provide new products and enhancements to existing products  including the criteria asset impairments and restructuring in fiscal  management approved restructuring actions in response to the continuing global economic slowdown and to improve the company s cost structure through reductions in personnel across all operating segments  the consolidation of the power sources operations in houston and the closure of its facility in costa rica 
the company recorded asset impairment and restructuring charges of million to reflect these actions 
these charges consisted primarily of severance costs of 
million  impairment costs of 
million on assets held for sale  million write off of a preferred stock investment in a start up company  and other related costs

million related to a acquisition  and a 
million write down of a marketable security of a company in bankruptcy 
see note o f the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional financial information regarding impairments and restructuring 
interest income and expense interest income decreased for fiscal and due primarily to lower average rates of return on investments and lower cash and investment balances 
provision for income taxes the company s tax benefit rate was in  in and its tax rate was in the principal items affecting the company s tax rate in were benefits associated with the dissolution of the company s subsidiary in costa rica  additional carryback benefits realized as a result of tax legislation enacted in  partially offset by the inability to deduct the losses of the company s foreign subsidiaries  and a provision to increase the company s valuation allowance on deferred tax assets 
the principal items affecting the company s tax rate in were tax benefits not available to a foreign subsidiary due to net operating loss limitations and a lower effective benefit rate related to a loss at the singapore subsidiary 
in addition  the rate was affected by a valuation allowance related to a capital loss  the fact that a tax benefit was not available for a portion of the singapore subsidiary s loss  us tax on a dividend from the singapore subsidiary and non deductible goodwill 
the p rincipal items affecting the company s tax rate in were foreign losses for which a tax benefit was not available and lower effective income tax rates related to undistributed foreign earnings 
at december   the company had carried back all eligible losses for tax years that had taxable income available to offset the losses 
in no carryback benefit is available  thus the company will not record income tax benefits related to future losses until future profits are available to offset the losses 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of liquidity have been cash provided by operations and working capital 
as of december  the company s working capital was million  of which million was cash and short term investments 
changes in the company s financial condition and liquidity during the three year period ended december  are generally attributable to changes in cash flows from operating activities  including the effects of significant research and development expenditures while experiencing a decline in revenues during and  the repurchase of  shares of common stock during fiscal and  and capital expenditures for property and equipment  primarily related to equipment purchases for the company s singapore facility 
net cash used by operating activities for the year ended december  was million  compared to million provided by operations during and million provided by operations in for the fiscal year ended december   the principal items affecting operating cash flow were the net loss of million  offset by depreciation expense of million  the non cash portion of the provision for impairment  restructuring and severance costs of million and a decrease in accounts receivable of million 
operating cash flow was also impacted by the increase in refundable income taxes of million  which are not expected to be received until the second quarter of net cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended december  was 
million  compared to million used in and million used in net cash used for fiscal was primarily capital expenditures for property and equipment of 
million  compared to million in  and million in in february  the company announced a plan to repurchase up to million shares of its common stock 
as of december  the company has repurchased a total of  shares  in and  in 
the net cash used in this financing activity was million in and million in the number of shares purchased was affected by the company limiting purchases to prices below certain per share amounts and certain regulatory requirements  including daily volume limitations 
although the company did not repurchase additional shares during  it may do so from time to time in the future subject to various factors  including market conditions and cash requirements to support operations 
the company s singapore subsidiary maintains a million line of credit facility to support the subsidiary s credit commitments 
as of december   million of the commitment was being utilized under letter of credit commitments 
the company  from time to time  evaluates potential acquisitions of businesses  products  and technologies that complement the company s business 
any such transactions  if consummated  may use a portion of the company s working capital or require the issuance of equity 
the company has no present commitments or agreements with respect to any material acquisitions 
the company has sustained significant negative financial trends  including substantial decreases in revenues  net income  backlog  and cash flows from operating activities 
key customers have continued to delay or reduce expenditures for the company s products and services 
management believes such trends may continue in the near term 
as discussed more fully in note  management has taken steps to restructure the operations of the company  including shutting down the costa rica facility in the third quarter of and downsizing its houston and singapore operations during the fourth quarter of in addition  significant impairment charges have been recorded during to reflect management s best estimate of the fair value of certain real estate and other investments 
the company s future strategy is primarily dependent on its ability to sell its newest generation of burn in and test systems for medium and high power micrologic devices  the criteria as a result of the current and ongoing downturn of the semiconductor industry  target customers for the criteria have continued to delay capital expenditures for new capacity  and no sales have been made to date 
while management believes that the first sales of the criteria will occur in late  no assurances can be made that market demand will return or that market acceptance can be achieved in that time frame 
the company has reviewed its forecasted operations for fiscal considering the results of management s recent cost cutting and restructuring actions  the company s limited financial obligations  its current cash balances  and proceeds from the tax refund expected in  management believes that it has sufficient cash to meet its working capital and capital equipment needs through fiscal and into depending on the company s growth  profitability and other factors  including market conditions  the company may require additional capital resources after fiscal there can be no assurances that additional financing will be available when required or that such financing can be obtained on terms satisfactory to the company 
certain ratios and amounts monitored by management in evaluating the company s financial resources and performance are presented in the following table working capital working capital thousands current ratio to to to equity ratios total liabilities to equity assets to equity profitability ratios gross profit return on revenues return on assets return on equity factors that may affect future results dependence on key customers a significant portion of the company s net sales is attributable to a few customers 
the company s ability to maintain or increase its sales in the future will depend in part upon its ability to obtain orders from existing and new customers as well as the financial success of its existing customers 
there can be no assurances that the company will be able to maintain or increase the level of its revenues in the future or that the company will be able to retain existing customers or to attract new customers 
because the company s products and services have been extensively customized to differing key customer requirements  the market for such products and services may be limited 
in addition  since development costs for such products are high  the company only develops products for  and provides services to  customers that it believes have the financial capacity to buy large enough quantities of products to provide the company a return on its investment 
cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry the company s revenues  gross margins and net income depend significantly on capital equipment expenditures of manufacturers of integrated circuits ics and products utilizing ics 
the semiconductor industry is cyclical in nature and has experienced periodic downturns which can have a severe effect on the demand for capital equipment 
the current and prior semiconductor industry downturns  oversupply  and excess production capacity have adversely affected demand for products and services sold by the company 
the need to continue investment in research and development and maintain customer service and support capability may limit the company s ability to reduce expenses 
rapid technological changes and product development rapid technological advances resulting in changing customer requirements and evolving industry standards requiring frequent new product introductions and enhancements characterize the semiconductor industry 
the company s future success will depend in large part on its ability to enhance its current products and to develop and introduce new products that keep pace with technological developments  achieve market acceptance and respond to constantly evolving customer requirements 
the company will need to continue to make substantial investments in research and product development in order to respond to rapid technological changes and to develop and introduce new products to meet customers expanding needs and evolving industry standards 
any failure by the company to anticipate or respond adequately to technological developments and customer requirements or any significant delays in product development or introduction could result in a loss of competitiveness and could have a material adverse effect on the co mpany 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully develop and manufacture new products or that any product enhancements or new products developed by the company will gain market acceptance 
competition the markets in which the company s products and services are sold are subject to intense competition and are characterized by rapid changing technology 
the company s competitors can be expected to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive price and performance characteristics 
competitive pressures often necessitate price reductions that can adversely affect operating results 
although the company believes that it has certain technological and other advantages over its competitors  maintaining such advantages will require a continued high level of investment by the company in research and development  marketing and service 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in the future 
fluctuation of operating results the company s operating results fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis because of a number of factors 
not only does the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry affect the company s operating results  but the status of world economic conditions and the timing of product shipments can also affect results 
for example  because the company s test and conditioning products have relatively high unit prices  the acceleration or delay of a small number of shipments from one quarter to the next can significantly affect the company s operating results for that quarter or that year 
dependence on skilled employees the company is dependent  in part  on its ability to attract and retain highly skilled managerial  marketing and technical personnel  including skilled applications and sales engineers 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel it requires to design  manufacture  market and support new and enhanced products and services 
limited sources of supplies although there is more than one potential supplier of all material component parts for the company s products  the company currently relies on a single source of supply for several components 
in most cases  the company is not a significant purchaser of raw materials from its suppliers and therefore has little control over either the availability or pricing of component parts 
accordingly  the company is vulnerable to delays in shipments caused by either a business interruption of a supplier or an undersupply of parts  and the company could experience production delays while an alternate supplier is procured 
such delays  if encountered for an extended period  could have a material adverse effect on the company 
intellectual property the company attempts to protect its intellectual property through patents  copyrights  trade secrets  trademarks  and other means the company believes however  that its success will depend to a greater extent upon innovation  technological expertise  service after the sale and customer relationships 
there can be no assurances that the company will be able to protect its proprietary rights or that competitors will not be able to develop similar or superior technology independently 
no assurance can be given that the claims allowed on any patents held by the company will be sufficiently broad to protect the company s technology 
no assurance can be given that any patents issued to the company will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to the company or that third parties patents will not adversely affect the company 
international operations the company operates a service facility in singapore and sells to customers for delivery outside of the us consequently  the company is subject to risk customarily found in international business operations  such as fluctuation of currency exchange rates  import and export controls  regulatory policies of foreign governments  longer receivable collection periods and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collections 
the company attempts to conduct its business and financial affairs so as to protect against political and economic risk  but there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in protecting itself 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company does not engage in speculative transactions and does not use derivative instruments or engage in hedging activities 
see the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the company s accounting policies and other information related to these financial instruments 
in the normal course of business the company is exposed to market risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and equity price changes that could impact the company s operating results 
as of december   fluctuations in interest rates  exchange rates  and equity price changes would not have significant material effect on the company s financial position or operating results 
the sensitivity analyses below do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall economic activity  nor do they consider additional actions management may take to mitigate the company s exposure to such changes 
interest rate risk the company places its short term investments  which generally have a term of less than days  with high quality financial institutions  limits the amount of credit exposure to any one institution  and has investment guidelines relative to diversification and maturities designed to maintain safety and liquidity 
as of december   the company had short term investments totaling million 
due to the short term nature of these instruments  the carrying value approximates market value 
if  during  average short term interest rates decrease by over average rates  the company s projected interest income from short term investments would decrease by approximately  assuming a similar level of investments in equity price risk as of december   the company held marketable equity securities with aggregate fair market values of  in the event that the carrying value of the company s equity investment exceeds its fair market value  and the decline in value is determined to be other than temporary  the carrying value is reduced to its current fair market value 
had market prices of such securities declined as of december  the values of these instruments would have decreased  foreign currency risk the company has a subsidiary located in singapore 
the subsidiary s functional currency and a significant portion of the assets  including cash investments  are denominated in us dollars 
during fiscal approximately of its singapore subsidiary s revenues and of its expenses were denominated in us dollars 
the balance of revenues and expenses were denominated in singapore dollars 
historically  fluctuations in the singapore dollar us dollar exchange rates have not had a material effect on the company 
the effects of foreign currency exchange rates were a loss of  a gain of  and a loss of  in fiscal  and respectively
