the company s business is seasonal 
demand for peanut and other nut products is highest during the months of october  november and december 
peanuts  pecans  walnuts  almonds and cashews  the company s principal raw materials  are purchased primarily during the period from august to february and are processed throughout the year 
as a result of this seasonality  the company s personnel and working capital requirements peak during the last four months of the calendar year 
also  due primarily to the seasonal nature of the company s business  the company maintains significant inventories of peanuts  pecans  walnuts  almonds and other nuts at certain times of the year  especially during the second and third quarters of the company s fiscal year 
fluctuations in the market prices of such nuts may affect the value of the company s inventory and thus the company s profitability 
there can be no assurance that future write downs of the company s inventory may not be required from time to time because of market price fluctuations  competitive pricing pressures  the effects of various laws or regulations or other factors 
see forward looking statements factors that may affect future results availability of raw materials and market price fluctuations 
at june   the company s inventories totaled approximately million compared to approximately million at june  the increase in inventories at june  when compared to june  is primarily due to i an increase in finished goods to support the increase in sales volume  ii an increase in the quantity of almonds on hand due to higher purchases during fiscal than fiscal  and iii an increase in the purchase price of pecans 
these increases in inventories were partially offset by decreases in inshell peanuts on hand due to a smaller domestic crop in fiscal see forward looking statements factors that may affect future results availability of raw materials and market price fluctuations 
to enhance consumer awareness of dietary issues associated with the consumption of peanuts and other nut products  the company has taken steps to educate consumers about the benefits of nut consumption 
also  there have been various medical studies detailing the healthy attributes of nuts and the mediterranean diet pyramid promotes the daily consumption of nuts as part of a healthy diet 
the company has no experience or data that indicates that the growth in the number of health conscious consumers will cause a change in nut consumption 
also  over the last few years there has been some publicity concerning allergic reactions to peanuts and other nuts 
however  the company has no experience or data that indicates peanut and other nut related allergies have affected the company s business 
furthermore  the company does not presently believe that nut related allergies will have a material adverse affect on the company s financial results in the foreseeable future 
critical accounting policies the accounting policies as disclosed in the notes to consolidated financial statements are applied in the preparation of the company s financial statements and accounting for the underlying transactions and balances 
the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical for an understanding of the company s financial statements because the application of these policies places the most significant demands on management s judgment  with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
specific risks  if applicable  for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
preparation of this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are stated at the amounts charged to customers  less i an allowance for doubtful accounts  ii a reserve for estimated cash discounts  and iii a reserve for customer deductions 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated by specifically identifying customers that are credit risks 
the reserve for estimated cash discounts is estimated using historical payment patterns 
the reserve for customer deductions represents an estimate of future credit memos that will be issued to customers and is based on historical experience 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
fluctuations in the market price of peanuts  pecans  walnuts  almonds and other nuts may affect the value of the company s inventory and thus the company s gross profit and gross profit margin 
if market prices were to move below cost  the company would record adjustments to write down the carrying values of inventories to fair market value 
customer incentives the ability to sell to certain retail customers often requires upfront payments by the company 
such payments are made pursuant to contracts that usually stipulate the term of the agreement  the quantity and type of products to be sold and any exclusivity requirements 
the cost of these payments is initially recorded as an asset and is amortized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract as a reduction in revenues 
related party transactions as discussed in note and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  the company leases space from related parties and transacts with other related parties in the normal course of business 
these related party transactions are conducted on an arm s length basis

forward looking statements the statements contained in this annual report on form k  and in the chairman s letter to stockholders accompanying the annual report on form k delivered to stockholders  that are not historical including statements concerning the company s expectations regarding market risk are forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements  which generally are followed and therefore identified by a cross reference to factors that may affect future results or are identified by the use of forward looking words and phrases such as intend  may  believes and expects  represent the company s present expectations or beliefs concerning future events 
the company cautions that such statements are qualified by important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements  including the factors described below under factors that may affect future results  as well as the timing and occurrence or non occurrence of transactions and events which may be subject to circumstances beyond the company s control 
consequently  results actually achieved may differ materially from the expected results included in these statements 
factors that may affect future results availability of raw materials and market price fluctuations the availability and cost of raw materials for the production of the company s products  including peanuts  pecans and other nuts are subject to crop size and yield fluctuations caused by factors beyond the company s control  such as weather conditions and plant diseases 
additionally  the supply of edible nuts and other raw materials used in the company s products could be reduced upon a determination by the united states department of agriculture the usda or other government agency that certain pesticides  herbicides or other chemicals used by growers have left harmful residues on portions of the crop or that the crop has been contaminated by aflatoxin or other agents 
shortages in the supply and resulting increases in the prices of nuts and other raw materials used by the company in its products to the extent that cost increases cannot be passed on to customers could have an adverse impact on the company s profitability 
furthermore  fluctuations in the market prices of nuts may affect the value of the company s inventories and the company s profitability 
the company has significant inventories of nuts that would be adversely affected by any decrease in the market price of such raw materials 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general 
competitive environment the company operates in a highly competitive environment 
the company s principal products compete against food and snack products manufactured and sold by numerous regional and national companies  some of which are substantially larger and have greater resources than the company  such as planters and ralcorp holdings  inc the company also competes with other shellers in the industrial market and with regional processors in the retail and wholesale markets 
in order to maintain or increase its market share  the company must continue to price its products competitively 
this competitive pricing may lower revenue per unit and cause declines in gross margin  if the company is unable to increase unit volumes as well as reduce its costs 
fixed price commitments from time to time  the company enters into fixed price commitments with its customers 
such commitments typically represent approximately of the company s annual net sales and are normally entered into after the company s cost to acquire the nut products necessary to satisfy the fixed price commitment is substantially fixed 
however  the company expects to continue to enter into fixed price commitments with respect to certain of its nut products prior to fixing its acquisition cost when  in management s judgment  market or crop harvest conditions so warrant 
to the extent the company does so  these fixed price commitments may result in losses 
historically  however  such losses have generally been offset by gains on other fixed price commitments 
however  there can be no assurance that losses from fixed price commitments may not have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
farm bill the farm security and rural investment act of the farm bill terminated the federal peanut quota program beginning with the crop year 
the farm bill replaced the federal peanut quota program with a fixed payment system through the crop year that can be either coupled or decoupled 
a coupled system is tied to the actual amount of production  while a decoupled system is not 
the series of loans and subsidies established by the farm bill is similar to the systems used for other crops such as grains and cotton 
to compensate farmers for the elimination of the peanut quota  the farm bill provides a buy out at a specified rate for each pound of peanuts that had been in that farmer s quota under the prior program 
additionally  among other provisions  the secretary of agriculture may make certain counter cyclical payments whenever the secretary believes that the effective price for peanuts is less than the target price 
the termination of the federal peanut quota program has resulted in a decrease in the company s cost for peanuts 
selling prices have not been adversely affected in a material manner during fiscal  resulting in a favorable impact on the company s gross profit and gross profit margin 
there are no assurances that selling prices for peanuts will not be adversely affected in the future or that the termination of the federal peanut quota program will not have an adverse effect on the company s business peanut shelling industry antitrust investigation on june   the company received a subpoena for the production of documents and records from the antitrust division of the us department of justice in connection with an antitrust investigation of the peanut shelling industry 
the company expects to cooperate fully in the investigation 
there can be no assurances as to the impact of the investigation on the peanut shelling industry or that the investigation will not have a material adverse effect on the company 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has not entered into transactions using derivative financial instruments 
the company believes that its exposure to market risk related to its other financial instruments which are the debt instruments under management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources is not material
