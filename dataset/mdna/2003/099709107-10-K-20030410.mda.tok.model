properties to be financed after the effective date of the new lease facility will be financed under that facility  and no additional properties will be financed under the original lease facility 
the lease financing facilities provide financing to lessors of properties leased to the company or its subsidiaries through loans from lenders for up to of a project s cost 
additionally  under the new lease facility  the unaffiliated lessor will make equity contributions approximating of the cost of each project 
the lessors under the original lease facility have made similar contributions

substantially all of the company s capital lease assets are related to properties financed under the original lease facility 
the company pays lessors who have financed properties under the original lease facility regular rental amounts for use of the properties 
these payments are equal to the carrying cost of the lessors borrowings for construction of the properties  and do not include amortization of the principal amounts of the lessors indebtedness relating to the properties 
the rental payments are categorized as occupancy expense  and as such are included as a component of cost of merchandise sold in the company s consolidated statements of operations

table of contents the company is subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations since interest on the company s borrowings is principally based on variable rates 
the company s objective in managing its exposure to interest rate fluctuations is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
the company primarily utilizes interest rate swaps to achieve this objective  effectively converting a portion of its variable rate exposures to fixed interest rates 
libor is the rate upon which the company s variable rate debt and its payments under the lease financing facilities are principally based 
if libor were to increase for the full year in as compared to the end of  the company s after tax earnings  after considering the effects of its existing interest rate swap agreements  would decrease approximately million based on the company s expected average outstanding debt  including its indirect borrowings under the original lease facility  as of january  a portion of the company s operations takes place in foreign jurisdictions  primarily the united kingdom  australia  new zealand and singapore 
as a result  the company s financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets where the company operates

actual results could differ from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes that the following discussion addresses 
table of contents the company s most critical accounting policies and estimates 
there have been no significant changes in these methodologies in as compared to the prior year 
asset impairments the carrying value of long lived assets is evaluated whenever changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
in performing such reviews for recoverability  the company compares the expected cash flows to the carrying value of long lived assets for the applicable stores 
if the expected future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of such assets  the company recognizes an impairment loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the estimated fair value 
expected future cash flows  which are estimated over each store s remaining lease term  contain estimates of sales and the impact those future sales will have upon cash flows 
future sales are estimated based upon a projection of each store s sales trend of the past several years 
additionally  each store s future cash contribution is based upon the most recent year s actual cash contribution  but is adjusted based upon projected sales trends 
fair value is estimated using expected discounted future cash flows  with the discount rate approximating the company s borrowing rate 
significant deterioration in the performance of the company s stores compared to projections could result in significant additional asset impairments 
goodwill impairment upon adoption of fas on january   the company s goodwill was tested for impairment  and no impairment existed 
the carrying amounts of the net assets of the applicable reporting units including goodwill were compared to the estimated fair values of those reporting units 
fair value was estimated using a discounted cash flow model which depended on  among other factors  estimates of future sales and expense trends  liquidity  and capitalization 
the discount rate used approximated the weighted average cost of capital of a hypothetical third party buyer 
changes in any of the assumptions underlying these estimates may result in the future impairment of goodwill 
the company s annual tests of goodwill impairment are based upon the methodology described above and are subject to the same risks and uncertainties 
inventory the carrying value of the company s inventory is affected by reserves for shrinkage and non returnable inventory 
projections of shrinkage are based upon the results of regular  periodic physical counts of the company s inventory 
the company s shrinkage reserve is adjusted as warranted based upon the trends yielded by the physical counts 
reserves for non returnable inventory are based upon the company s history of liquidating non returnable inventory 
the markdown percentages utilized in developing the reserve are evaluated against actual  ongoing markdowns of non returnable inventory to ensure that they remain consistent 
significant differences between future experience and that which was projected for either the shrinkage or non returnable inventory reserves could affect the recorded amounts of inventory and cost of sales 
the company includes certain distribution and other expenses in its inventory costs  particularly freight  distribution payroll  and certain occupancy expenses 
in addition  certain selling  general and administrative expenses are included in inventory costs 
these amounts totaled approximately million and million as of january  and january   respectively 
the extent to which these costs are included in inventory is based on certain estimates of space and labor allocation 
leases all leases  including those for properties financed through the lease financing facilities  are reviewed for capital or operating classification at their inception under the guidance of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for leases fas  as amended 
the leases of certain properties financed through the original lease facility were capitalized based upon this and other guidance

based on the results of analysis performed by the company  lessors of certain properties 
table of contents financed through the original lease facility are consolidated in the consolidated financial statements of the company 
advertising and vendor incentive programs the company receives payments and credits from vendors pursuant to co operative advertising programs  shared markdown programs  purchase volume incentive programs and magazine slotting programs 
these programs continue to be beneficial for both the company and vendors  and the company expects continued participation in these types of programs 
changes in vendor participation levels  as well as changes in the volume of merchandise purchased  among other factors  could adversely impact the company s results of operations and liquidity 
pursuant to co operative advertising programs offered by vendors  the company contracts with vendors to promote merchandise for specified time periods 
pursuant to the provisions of emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor eitf  which the company adopted effective january   vendor consideration which represents a reimbursement of specific  incremental  identifiable costs is included in the selling  general and administrative line on the consolidated statements of operations  along with the related costs  in the period the promotion takes place 
consideration which exceeds such costs is classified as a reduction of the cost of merchandise sold line on the consolidated statements of operations 
prior to the adoption of eitf  all consideration and costs pursuant to co operative advertising programs were included in the selling  general and administrative expenses line of the consolidated statements of operations 
the company also receives credits from vendors pursuant to shared markdown programs  purchase volume programs  and magazine slotting programs 
credits received pursuant to these programs are classified in the cost of merchandise sold line on the consolidated statements of operations  and are recognized upon certain product volume thresholds being met or product placements occurring
