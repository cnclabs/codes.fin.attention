earnings for increased by approximately from the  or per share reported for the company s earnings increase was generated primarily by the company s core banking segment 
german american s mortgage banking operations were adversely affected during the fourth quarter and throughout due to the impact of historic low levels of interest rates on the valuation of mortgage servicing rights and net interest income 
the mortgage banking segment experienced net losses of  during compared to nearly break even results in of  net income 
in  earnings increased by  or  from the  or per share reported for significantly contributing to the increase in earnings was  of after tax charges recorded in related to a balance sheet restructuring which occurred late in the fourth quarter of as described below 
the increase in net income was largely fueled by increases in insurance revenues and mortgage banking revenues and a decrease in provision for loan losses 
the increase in the non interest revenue sources helped to mitigate a decline of million  or in net interest income 
late in the fourth quarter of  the company initiated a repositioning of its balance sheet within the mortgage banking component of the company s operations 
approximately million of sub prime  out of market mortgage loans were reclassified as held for sale in december the sale of these loans was completed in february for a discussion of the expected effect on the company s net income  and net income per share  that may result in the event that the company purchases a material number of shares of its common stock pursuant to its pending self tender offer  see expected effects of purchase of shares pursuant to tender offer  below  in this item net interest income net interest income is the company s single largest source of earnings  and represents the difference between interest and fees realized on earning assets  less interest paid on deposits and borrowed funds 
several factors contribute to the determination of net interest income and net interest margin  including the volume and mix of earning assets  interest rates  and income taxes 
many factors affecting net interest income are subject to control by management policies and actions 
factors beyond the control of management include the general level of credit and deposit demand  federal reserve board monetary policy  and changes in tax laws 
net interest income declined modestly during by  or an increase of  on a tax equivalent basis compared with net interest margin is tax equivalent net interest income expressed as a percentage of average earning assets 
for the net interest margin improved to compared with for the improvement in net interest margin in was primarily attributable to the historically low interest rate environment that enabled the company to significantly lower its cost of funds 
the maturity of higher costing borrowed funds coupled with an increase in transaction deposits savings  money market  and demand deposit accounts were the most significant factors in the lower cost of funds 
an overall decline in interest earning assets primarily due to a lower level of residential mortgage loans and the effects of the low interest rate environment on loan and security yields tempered the effects of the lower cost of funds during the company s net interest income has been negatively impacted by the company s mortgage banking segment 
the mortgage banking segment s net interest income declined by million during compared with the decline resulted from the sale of sub prime residential real estate loans in combined with the prepayment of a significant amount of the segment s portfolio loans and the continued sale of a majority of the company s residential real estate production to the secondary market 
in contrast  the core banking segment s net interest income increased million during  primarily due to the decrease in the cost of funds discussed above 
the company has re invested some assets that resulted from the decline in loans in its mortgage banking segment in shorter term investment securities 
the company expects to apply the proceeds from the sale or redemption of approximately million of these investment securities to retire certain fhlb advances 
in the aggregate  the mortgage banking segment has approximately million of fhlb advances that mature in   and the interest rates payable by the company on these long term fhlb advances have been higher than the yields that have been earned by the company on the shorter term investments that have been internally matched to the repayment of those advances  resulting in a negative interest spread on this portion of the mortgage banking segment s balance sheet and a consequent negative impact on the segment s net interest income 
see note for a discussion of the cost of fhlb advances 
a portion of these shorter term investments were used in december to retire million of fhlb advances that matured in december or were scheduled to mature in january this million portion of the segment s balance sheet carried an approximately negative interest spread during a significant period of during  net interest income declined  or  or on a tax equivalent basis compared with the net interest margin for improved modestly from the in the decline in the company s net interest income during was largely attributable to a decline in the overall level of interest earning assets and an increase in federal funds sold and other short term investments 
the decline in interest earning assets was attributable to the call of investment securities during the first half of  refinance activity in the residential real estate loan portfolio  and the aforementioned sale of sub prime residential real estate loans 
average loans outstanding including loans held for sale declined million during compared with the decline in loans is attributable primarily to a significant reduction in the company s residential mortgage loan portfolio 
this reduction is attributable to the refinance activity in the residential loan industry that has been fueled by the historically low interest rate environment and the company s continued sale of a majority of residential loan production to the secondary market 
residential loans declined million during mitigating the decline in residential loans has been growth in the commercial loan portfolio of million during average loans outstanding including loans held for sale declined million during compared with the sale of sub prime residential mortgage loans previously discussed was a significant factor in the reduced level of average loans outstanding 
also contributing to the decline in average loans outstanding during has been the sale of a majority of the company s residential loan production to the secondary market

provision for loan losses the company provides for loan losses through regular provisions to the allowance for loan losses  which totaled   and   and  respectively 
these provisions were made at a level deemed necessary by management to absorb estimated  probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio 
the higher level of provision during relates primarily to estimated losses in the company s loan portfolio and the general increase in the company s commercial loan portfolio 
the lower level of provision during was primarily a result of the liquidation of the company s sub prime  out of market residential mortgage loan portfolio 
the higher provision in was due to an increase in estimated losses related to the mortgage division s sub prime  out of market residential mortgage loan portfolio and overall loan growth throughout the company 
as discussed previously  the company sold its sub prime  out of market residential real estate portfolio in february  and the company no longer originates these types of loans 
a detailed evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is completed quarterly by management  the results of which will be used to determine provisions for loan losses 
management estimates the allowance balance required using past loan loss experience  the nature and volume of the portfolio  information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values  economic conditions  and other factors 
refer also to the section entitled lending and loan administration for further discussion of the provision and allowance for loan losses 
non interest income non interest income declined in this decrease was primarily attributable to a decline in the company s insurance revenues 
non interest income  excluding securities gains losses and the net gains on sales of loans and related assets and provision for losses on loans held for sale  increased  or in increases in the company s insurance revenues and an increased level of service charge income on deposit accounts resulted in the overall increase in total non interest income  inclusive of asset sale gains  increased during the fluctuation in was primarily attributable to the provision for losses on loans held for sale related to the mortgage division s sub prime  out of market residential mortgage loans that were reclassified as held for sale in december and sold in february change from non interest income dollars in thousands prior year trust and investment product fees   service charges on deposit accounts   insurance revenues   other operating income   subtotal   net gains losses on sales of loans  related assets  and provision for losses on loans held for sale    n m securities gains losses  net total non interest income  n m not meaningful insurance revenues decreased in the decline in insurance revenues resulted from a decline in contingency income from the company s property and casualty insurance operations and a decline in revenues generated by the company s credit reinsurance operations 
contingency income will fluctuate  as it represents amounts received from insurance companies based on claims experience 
the decline in credit insurance and reinsurance revenues is largely attributable to a decline in consumer loan production and credit insurance sales penetration 
insurance revenues increased in due primarily to the expansion of the company s property and casualty insurance operations 
in addition  insurance revenues increased in due to the initiation during of the company s credit life and disability reinsurance operation through german american reinsurance company  ltd garc 
service charges on deposit accounts increased and in and  respectively 
a change in fee structure implemented mid year and a general increase in collections of fees were generally responsible for these increases 
german american financial advisors trust company gafa was formed mid year to provide expanded financial planning  full service brokerage  trust administration and other financial services 
the formation of gafa provides customers an enhanced ability to fulfill all their financial needs through the company s affiliate banks and associated financial services companies 
trust and investment product fees increased in after a decrease in of 
other operating income decreased and in and  respectively 
the declines were primarily the result of increased impairment adjustments on the mortgage banking segment s mortgage servicing rights portfolio 
the increased impairment adjustments are due to the historically low levels of mortgage loan rates and the significant refinance activity in the residential mortgage loan industry 
net gains on sales of loans and related assets  and the provision for losses on loans held for sale are derived from the company s core banking and mortgage banking segments 
the gain on sale of loans and related assets increased in historically low interest rates have fueled relatively strong mortgage loan sales during and loan sales remained stable in at million compared to million in excluding the sub prime sale discussed previously 
loan sales in were million 
net gains losses on sales of loans  related assets  and provision for losses on loans held for sale increased  exclusive of the sub prime sale in this increase was due to the significant increase in loan sales to the secondary market 
the provision for losses on loans held for sale on the market adjustment of sub prime loans reclassified in december totaled  resulting in the net loss on sales of loans  related assets  and provision for losses on loans held for sale of  during non interest expense non interest expense decreased  or in following an increase of  or during the decline in resulted primarily from decreased other operating expenses and advertising expenses tempered by an increase in salaries and employee benefits 
the increase in resulted largely from increased personnel costs

salaries and employee benefits increased in and in in  the increase in salaries and employee benefits was driven by increases in salary and retirement expenses  incentive compensation and employee insurance benefits 
the increases in salary and retirement benefits were attributable to adjustments occurring in the normal course of operations 
significant earnings improvements in the company s core banking segment resulted in increased employee incentive compensation 
in  the increase in salaries and employee benefits was attributed to two primary factors 
the company transitioned to a pay for performance incentive plan in late and resulting in increased incentive compensation expense while salary expense remained flat 
in addition  employee insurance benefit costs increased during professional fees increased during following a decrease of in a significant amount of increased professional fees in resulted from the formation of investment subsidiaries domiciled in the state of nevada by four of the company s subsidiary banks 
the increased professional fees expense was for investment portfolio management services and subsidiary management services provided by third parties 
the level of professional fees decreased during due in large part to the merger and acquisition activities in late data processing fees remaining relatively flat in during  data processing fees increased  or 
this level of increase is due to a general rise in the number of accounts serviced by the company s third party data processor and an increase in fees associated with the electronic banking services provided to the company s customers 
advertising and promotion expense decreased during this decline was attributable to the initiation of an image campaign by the company in the first quarter of and generally a lower level of advertising and promotional spending in advertising and promotion expense increased in due in large part to the introduction of the image campaign previously discussed 
other operating expenses decreased in this decrease was the result of several factors 
the company experienced a lower level of operating losses from its affordable housing tax credit limited partnership investments  reduced collection costs in the company s mortgage banking segment and a decreased allowance for insurance reserves required by the company s credit reinsurance subsidiary 
in addition  the company recognized a lower level of amortization expense for intangible assets in the decline in amortization expense for intangible assets resulted from the company s adoption of new accounting guidance in the company ceased amortizing goodwill as a result of this accounting change 
goodwill will be assessed at least annually for impairment and any such impairment will be recognized in the period identified 
other operating expenses remained flat in compared with collection costs declined  or during due primarily to the sale of the mortgage division s sub prime residential real estate loan portfolio in early the decline in collection costs was in large part offset by the building of insurance reserves for the company s credit reinsurance subsidiary 
provision for income taxes the company records a provision for current income taxes payable  along with a provision for deferred taxes payable in the future 
deferred taxes arise from temporary differences  which are items recorded for financial statement purposes in a different period than for income tax returns 
the company s effective tax rate was   and  respectively  in   and the effective tax rate in all periods is lower than the blended statutory rate of 
the lower effective rate in all periods primarily resulted from the company s tax exempt investment income on securities and loans  and from income tax credits generated by investments in affordable housing projects 
also contributing to the lower effective tax rate in compared with was state income tax savings resulting from the formation of investment subsidiaries domiciled in the state of nevada by four of the company s banking subsidiaries 
the lower effective tax rate in compared with the other years presented was attributable to a lower level of taxable income due primarily to the provision for losses on loans held for sale

the company does not have access at the parent company level to the sources of funds that are available to its bank subsidiaries to support their operations 
the company derives most of its parent company revenues from dividends or interest paid to the parent company by its bank subsidiaries 
these subsidiaries are subject to statutory restrictions on their ability to pay dividends to the parent company 
the frb possesses enforcement powers over bank holding companies and their non bank subsidiaries that enable it to prevent or remedy actions that in its view may represent unsafe or unsound practices or violations of applicable statutes and regulations 
among these powers is the ability in appropriate cases to proscribe the payment of dividends by banks and bank holding companies 
the fdic and dfi possess similar enforcement powers over the bank subsidiaries of the company 
the prompt corrective action provisions of federal banking law impose further restrictions on the payment of dividends by insured banks which fail to meet specified capital levels and  in some cases  their parent bank holding companies 
the company intends to fund approximately  of its potential obligation to purchase shares pursuant to its pending self tender offer and to pay related fees and expenses by applying cash and investments currently held by the parent company 
if the company requires more than  in order to purchase shares validly tendered under the offer and pay related fees and expenses  the company expects to finance the additional funds requirements by drawing against a revolving line of credit that it proposes to establish with bank one  na  chicago  illinois bank one 
bank one has issued a commitment letter to the company to establish a  revolving line of credit for the purpose of funding stock repurchases and parent company working capital needs  with a proposed maturity date for the repayment of principal and all accrued unpaid interest of two years from the date of establishment

for a description of expected additional terms and conditions of this proposed revolving line of credit  see item of this report 
although the parent company might not be required to borrow any funds under this line of credit if the tender offer is not fully subscribed  the parent company might borrow as much as  under this line of credit in connection with the consummation of the purchase of shares under the pending self tender offer  assuming that as many as  shares are tendered under the offer and the company purchases the  shares that it is obligated to purchase under that offer subject to the offer s terms and conditions and also elects to purchase all  additional shares that it may elect to purchase under the terms of the offer

these risks include credit risk  liquidity risk and interest rate risk 
various procedures are employed at the company s affiliate banks to monitor and mitigate risk in their loan and investment portfolios  as well as risks associated with changes in interest rates 
following is a discussion of the company s philosophies and procedures to address these risks 
lending and loan administration primary responsibility and accountability for day to day lending activities rests with the company s affiliate banks 
loan personnel at each bank have the authority to extend credit under guidelines approved by the bank s board of directors 
executive and board loan committees active at each bank serve as vehicles for communication and for the pooling of knowledge  judgment and experience of its members 
these committees provide valuable input to lending personnel  act as an approval body  and monitor the overall quality of the banks loan portfolios 
the corporate loan committee  comprised of members of the company s executive officers and board of directors  strive to ensure a consistent application of the company s lending policies 
the company also maintains a comprehensive risk weighting and loan review program for its affiliate banks  which includes quarterly reviews of problem loans  delinquencies and charge offs 
the purpose of this program is to evaluate loan administration  credit quality  loan documentation and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the company maintains an allowance for loan losses to cover probable credit losses identified during its loan review process 
the allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses and decreased by charge offs less recoveries 
management estimates the required level of allowance for loan losses using past loan loss experience  the nature and volume of the portfolio  information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values  economic conditions  and other factors 
allocations of the allowance may be made for specific loans  but the entire allowance is available for any loan that  in management s judgement  should be charged off 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed 
the allowance for loan losses is comprised of a specific reserves on individual credits  b allocated reserves for certain loan categories and industries  and overall historical loss experience  and c unallocated reserves based on performance trends in the loan portfolios  current economic conditions  and other factors that influence the level of estimated probable losses 
the need for specific reserves are considered for credits when a the customer s cash flow or net worth appears insufficient to repay the loan  b the loan has been criticized in a regulatory examination  c the loan is on non accrual  or  d other reasons where the ultimate collectibility of the loan is in question  or the loan characteristics require special monitoring

the increase in specific allocations resulted primarily from commercial loan growth and reclassification of individual loans identified in the company s comprehensive risk weighting and loan review program 
net charge offs have declined in both and the improved trend in net charge offs for were spread across all loan categories 
the trend in net charge offs improved during primarily as a result of a decline in residential real estate loan charge offs 
the upward trend in net charge offs in was primarily related to sub prime  out of market residential real estate loans at the company s mortgage banking division 
the company discontinued new sub prime  out of market residential real estate lending during  and the portfolio of these loans was sold in refer also to the section entitled provision for loan losses in the discussion regarding the results of operations 
non performing assets non performing assets consist of a non accrual loans  b loans which have been renegotiated to provide for a reduction or deferral of interest or principal because of deterioration in the financial condition of the borrower  c loans past due ninety days or more as to principal or interest  and  d other real estate owned

liquidity and interest rate risk management liquidity is a measure of the ability of the company s subsidiary banks to fund new loan demand  existing loan commitments and deposit withdrawals 
the purpose of liquidity management is to match sources of funds with anticipated customer borrowings and withdrawals and other obligations to ensure a dependable funding base  without unduly penalizing earnings 
failure to properly manage liquidity requirements can result in the need to satisfy customer withdrawals and other obligations on less than desirable terms 
the liquidity of the parent company is dependent upon the receipt of dividends from its bank subsidiaries  which are subject to certain regulatory limitations explained in note to the consolidated financial statements  included in item of this report  as enhanced by its ability to draw upon a line of credit established by the parent company in march with a correspondent bank lender  as described under sources of funds parent company funding sources  above 
the affiliate banks source of funding is predominately core deposits  maturities of securities  repayments of loan principal and interest  federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and borrowings from the federal home loan bank 
interest rate risk is the exposure of the company s financial condition to adverse changes in market interest rates 
in an effort to estimate the impact of sustained interest rate movements to the company s earnings  the company monitors interest rate risk through computer assisted simulation modeling of its net interest income 
the company s simulation modeling monitors the potential impact to net interest income under various interest rate scenarios 
the company s objective is to actively manage its asset liability position within a one year interval and to limit the risk in any of the interest rate scenarios to a reasonable level of tax equivalent net interest income within that interval 
funds management committees at the holding company and each affiliate bank monitor compliance within established guidelines of the funds management policy

expected effects of purchase of shares pursuant to tender offer the tender offer and its financing the company on february   commenced a tender offer for up to  of its common shares  at per share  net to the seller 
the company has reserved the right to purchase up to an additional  shares if they are tendered pursuant to the offer  but it is not obligated to do so 
the offer is scheduled to expire at pm cst on march   unless the company elects to extend the offer 
the complete terms and conditions of the offer are filed as exhibits to a tender offer statement on schedule to that was filed by the company on february   as amended  which is available free of charge by accessing the securities and exchange commission site on the world wide web  www

assuming the company purchases the maximum of  shares that it is obligated to purchase pursuant to the offer at a purchase price of per share  the company expects the maximum aggregate cost of such purchase to be approximately  including estimated fees and expenses of approximately  if as many as  shares are tendered under the offer and the company elects to purchase all of the additional  shares  the company expects the maximum aggregate cost to be approximately  including estimated fees and expenses of approximately the company intends to fund approximately  of its potential obligation to purchase shares pursuant to the offer and to pay related fees and expenses by applying cash and investments currently held by the parent company 
if the company requires more than  in order to purchase shares validly tendered under the offer and pay related fees and expenses  the company expects to finance the additional funds requirements by drawing against a revolving line of credit that it proposes to establish with bank one  na  chicago  illinois bank one 
bank one has issued a commitment letter to the company to establish a  revolving line of credit for the purpose of funding stock repurchases and parent company working capital needs  with a proposed maturity date for the repayment of principal and all accrued unpaid interest of two years from the date of establishment 
bank one has orally indicated a willingness to increase the amount of its revolving line of credit to an amount greater than  but not more than  and the company may request a line of credit greater than  in the event that the self tender offer is oversubscribed and the company elects to purchase more than the  shares that it is obligated to purchase 
in accordance with bank one s commitment letter  interest on the unpaid balance of the loan is expected to be payable quarterly at a rate of day libor plus basis points and there is expected to be a commitment fee on the unused balance of basis points per annum 
establishment of the credit facility is subject to the execution and delivery of a mutually acceptable loan agreement  which is expected to include usual and customary covenants  including an agreement by the company not to incur other debt without bank one s consent  an agreement that the company will not pledge to others its investments in its subsidiaries  and an agreement to maintain its capital and the capital of its subsidiaries at well capitalized levels as that term is defined by bank regulatory agencies 
purpose and expected effects of the offer the company made the tender offer because it believes that the purchase of its shares is an attractive use of a portion of its available capital on behalf of its shareholders 
the company s current capital base significantly exceeds the amount of capital that is required by applicable regulatory standards  and the amount of capital needed to support its current and anticipated future operations 
as interest rates have declined to year lows  the company s incremental current earnings on this excess capital is quite low 
the company therefore believes that the excess capital has had a detrimental effect on the level of the company s return on equity and earnings per share 
assuming continued profitability  the company believes that the repurchase of shares pursuant to the offer has the potential to increase the company s return on equity and earnings per share by reducing the amount of equity capital and the number of shares outstanding 
the company s statements  in this paragraph and elsewhere  regarding its expectations that its purchase of shares pursuant to the offer have the potential to increase its return on equity and earnings per share are forward looking statements 
with respect to these statements  readers are cautioned that the company s expectations regarding enhanced earnings per share and return on equity as a result of the offer assume that the company purchases a substantial portion of the maximum number of shares that it is seeking to purchase at the offer price  and that the company s earnings and financial condition are not materially different from its recent earnings and current financial condition  except to the extent that earnings and financial condition are affected by the purchase of the shares pursuant to the offer 
readers are further cautioned that a variety of factors could cause the company s actual results to differ from those described herein  including general and local economic conditions  interest rate changes  risks associated with acquisitions  credit risks  regulatory risks and competition 
for a more complete description of factors that could cause future results to differ from those described in forward looking statements  see the discussion captioned forward looking statements in item  business  which is incorporated herein by reference 
purchase of a material number of the company s shares under the offer will result in a decrease in the amount of cash and marketable investments held by the company  and in particular the amount of cash and marketable investments held by the parent company 
see sources of funds parent company funding sources  above  in this item further  the company s equity capital will be reduced to the extent that the company purchases shares and pays expenses and costs under the tender offer 
however  the company expects that it will continue to remain well capitalized as that term is defined by federal banking regulations and that its capital levels will continue to significantly exceed the minimum required capital levels for each measure of capital adequacy  even if the company elects to purchase the maximum number  of shares that it is permitted to buy without amending the offer 
see item of this report  business regulation and supervision  for additional discussion of the term well capitalized and of the capital adequacy requirements imposed by law on bank holding companies and banks 
the parent company expects to repay any amounts advanced to it by bank one under the line of credit on or before the line of credit s maturity through future dividends to be received from its subsidiaries 
as discussed under sources of funds parent company funding sources  above  in this item  the company s subsidiaries are subject to statutory restrictions on their ability to pay dividends to the parent company  and regulatory authorities have the power to restrict or prohibit the payment by such subsidiaries of dividends to the parent company in certain circumstances 
at december   the parent company s subsidiary banks had million in retained earnings available for dividends to the parent company without prior regulatory approval  and during the subsidiaries paid the parent company an aggregate of million in dividends 
therefore  the statutory and regulatory restrictions on the ability of the company s subsidiaries to pay dividends to the parent company have not historically had  and are not expected in the future to have  a material impact on the ability of the parent company to meet its cash obligations  even if the company elects to purchase the maximum number of shares  that it may purchase under the offer 
the company s expectations regarding the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends to the parent company in the future that are included in this paragraph are forward looking statements  however  and the company s actual experience may differ significantly from its expectations 
for a discussion of factors that could cause the asset quality  profitability  cash flow  and capital resources of the subsidiaries to be adversely affected and which therefore could adversely affect the ability of such subsidiaries to pay dividends to the parent company  see forward looking statements in item  business  above  which is incorporated herein by reference

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk is reviewed on a regular basis by the asset liability committees and boards of directors of the holding company and its affiliate banks 
primary market risks which impact the company s operations are liquidity risk and interest rate risk  as discussed above 
as discussed previously  the company monitors interest rate risk by the use of computer simulation modeling to estimate the potential impact on its net interest income under various interest rate scenarios 
another method by which the company s interest rate risk position can be estimated is by computing estimated changes in its net portfolio value npv 
this method estimates interest rate risk exposure from movements in interest rates by using interest rate sensitivity analysis to determine the change in the npv of discounted cash flows from assets and liabilities 
npv represents the market value of portfolio equity and is equal to the estimated market value of assets minus the estimated market value of liabilities 
computations are based on a number of assumptions  including the relative levels of market interest rates and prepayments in mortgage loans and certain types of investments 
these computations do not contemplate any actions management may undertake in response to changes in interest rates  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
in addition  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of computing npv 
should interest rates remain or decrease below current levels  the proportion of adjustable rate loans could decrease in future periods due to refinancing activity 
in the event of an interest rate change  prepayment levels would likely be different from those assumed in the table 
lastly  the ability of many borrowers to repay their adjustable rate debt may decline during a rising interest rate environment 
the following table provides an assessment of the risk to npv in the event of sudden and sustained and increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates 
the table indicates that as of december  the company s estimated npv might be expected to increase in the event of an increase in prevailing interest rates  and might be expected to decrease in the event of a decrease in prevailing interest rates dollars in thousands
