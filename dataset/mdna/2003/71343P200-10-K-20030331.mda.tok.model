item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we manufacture  distribute  and market a broad portfolio of primarily pepsico and cadbury schweppes brands in the us  central europe and the caribbean 
the following discussion and analysis includes six major categories critical accounting policies  related party transactions  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources  recently issued accounting pronouncements  and discussion of our market risks 
the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this form k 
forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains certain forward looking statements of expected future developments  as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of the forward looking statements in this form k refer to the expectations regarding continuing operating improvement and other matters 
these forward looking statements reflect our expectations and are based on currently available data  however  actual results are subject to future risks and uncertainties  which could materially affect actual performance 
risks and uncertainties that could affect such performance include  but are not limited to  the following competition  including product and pricing pressures  changing trends in consumer tastes  changes in our relationship and or support programs with pepsico and other brand owners  market acceptance of new product offerings  weather conditions  cost and availability of raw materials  availability of capital  labor and employee benefit costs  unfavorable interest rate and currency fluctuations  costs of legal proceedings  outcomes of environmental claims and litigation  and general economic  business and political conditions in the countries and territories where we operate 
these events and uncertainties are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many are beyond our control 
we assume no obligation to publicly release the result of any revisions that may be made to any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to use estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience  available information and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and revisions to estimates are included in our results for the period in which the actual amounts or revisions become known 
presented in our notes to the consolidated financial statements is a summary of our most significant accounting policies used in the preparation of such statements 
significant estimates in the consolidated financial statements include goodwill impairment  environmental liabilities  and income taxes goodwill impairment 
goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually  using a two step approach at the reporting unit level us  central europe and the caribbean 
first  we estimate the fair value of the reporting units primarily using discounted estimated future cash flows 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of the potential loss 
goodwill impairment is measured by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount 
we will estimate the fair value of all assets in determining the implied fair value of goodwill 
the impairment evaluation requires the use of considerable management judgment to determine the fair value of the reporting units using discounted future cash flows  including estimates and assumptions regarding amount and timing of cash flows  cost of capital and growth rates 
environmental liabilities 
we continue to be subject to certain indemnification obligations under agreements related to previously sold subsidiaries  including potential environmental liabilities see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have recorded our best estimate of our probable liability under those indemnification obligations  with the assistance of outside consultants and other professionals 
such estimates and the recorded liabilities are subject to various factors  including possible insurance recoveries  the allocation of liabilities among other potentially responsible parties  the advancement of technology for means of remediation  possible changes in the scope of work at the contaminated sites  as well as possible changes in related laws  regulations  and agency requirements 
income taxes 
our effective income tax rate and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities reflect management s best estimate of the outcome of future tax audits 
we have established valuation allowances using management s best judgment where expected results do not support the realization of deferred tax assets 
related party transactions transactions with pepsico 
pepsico and pepsiamericas share a business objective of increasing availability and consumption of their brands 
accordingly  pepsico provides us with various forms of marketing support to promote their brands

results of operations in the discussions of our results of operations below  the number of cases sold is referred to as volume 
net pricing is net sales divided by number of cases and gallons sold for our core businesses  which include bottles and cans including vending bottles and cans as well as food service 
changes in net pricing include the impact of sales price or rate changes  as well as the impact of brand  package and geographic mix 
net pricing and reported volume amounts exclude contract  commissary  private label  concentrate  and vending other than bottles and cans revenue and volume 
contract sales represent sales of manufactured product to other franchised bottlers and typically decline as excess manufacturing capacity is utilized 
cost of goods sold per unit is the cost of goods sold for our core businesses divided by related number of cases and gallons sold 
operating results compared with volume 
in  total volume increased percent  including us volume growth of percent and central europe volume growth of percent  while caribbean volume declined percent 
us volume growth of percent was driven by strong brand performance by mountain dew  sierra mist  aquafina and dr pepper 
mountain dew volume grew percent  driven mainly by continued growth in regular and diet mountain dew code red 
pepsi flavored soft drink volume grew almost percent  due mainly to the strong performance and expanded distribution of sierra mist  while aquafina continued to have strong volume growth of approximately percent 
the growth in pepsi branded products was partially offset by a percent volume decline in trademark pepsi  which accounts for approximately percent of the us volume mix 
dr pepper volume grew percent  led by diet dr pepper 
we experienced package volume growth for carbonated soft drinks in cans and take home polyethylene terehthalate pet packages or plastic bottle packages  led by the ounce non returnable pet package  which benefited from significant growth in the supermarkets and supercenters 
small format and on premise channel performance declined from the prior year  resulting primarily from continued softness in our single serve packages  primarily the ounce non returnable plastic bottles 
our central europe markets had volume growth of percent in  reflecting strong growth in all four countries 
new product innovation  including the introduction of pepsi twist  contributed to a percent growth in carbonated soft drinks  while water offerings experienced a strong percent growth 
carbonated soft drinks and water account for approximately percent and percent of total volume  respectively  in central europe 
both water and carbonated soft drinks experienced growth in the single serve and multi serve pet packages  primarily in the large format and wholesale channels  while on premise volume declined 
approximately percent of the total volume growth in central europe was achieved in still drinks  primarily due to the expanded distribution of the toma brand flavored still drinks in all our markets in central europe 
volume in the caribbean decreased percent in compared to  reflecting declines in puerto rico and jamaica 
overall  the pepsi trademark products declined  despite growth from new product introduction  while seven up  aquafina and other local flavored brands volume increased from the prior year 
net sales 
net sales in increased percent to  million compared to  million in excluding the million net sales of the beer business that was divested in the first quarter of  net sales increased million  or percent  primarily driven by the increase in net sales in the us and central europe 
us net sales increased percent to  million from  million 
excluding the net sales of the divested beer business in  us net sales increased percent  driven by volume growth of percent  as discussed above  and increased net pricing of percent from the prior year 
the increase in net pricing was driven by price increases of percent and package mix contribution of percent 
these factors were partially offset by a million  or percent  decrease in other revenue  including commissary and contract sales 
the growth in central europe net sales of million  or percent  to million from million in the prior year resulted from strong volume growth of percent  as well as favorable foreign exchange rates offset  in part  by a percent decline in net pricing 
the favorable foreign exchange rates contributed approximately million to central europe s net sales improvement 
the volume growth impact on net sales was mitigated  in part  by the percent decline in net pricing in central europe  principally led by declines in poland offset  in part  by increases in hungary 
in addition  other revenues declined million from the prior year  including decreases in contract sales and private label sales  as was anticipated 
caribbean net sales increased percent in to million from million in the prior year 
volume in the caribbean decreased percent in compared to the prior year  offset by an increase in net pricing of percent in pricing improvements were achieved in all markets 
other revenue increases  including concentrate and export sales contributed percent of the net sales growth in cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold increased million in to  million from  million in the prior year 
excluding costs associated with the divested beer business totaling million  cost of sales increased million  or percent  in in the us  excluding the impact of the divested beer business  us cost of goods sold increased million  or percent  to  million  driven by the percent growth in volume  and an almost percent increase in cost of goods sold per unit 
the increase in cost of goods sold per unit reflected higher concentrate costs  as well as increases in other ingredient and packaging costs associated with changes in the mix of products sold 
this includes more of our products being sold in non returnable pet packages versus can packages  a trend we expect to continue 
the above factors were partially offset by a decrease in other cost of goods sold related to the decrease in contract and commissary sales 
our concentrate prices will continue to increase in in the us  as pepsico has recently announced to its franchise bottlers that they will increase the price of concentrate by percent  effective for one year  beginning february we expect a similar increase of percent by cadbury schweppes in in central europe  cost of goods sold increased million  or percent  to million in from million in the prior year 
cost of goods sold increased due to volume growth of percent and due to the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translations  which added approximately million to costs as measured in us dollars  offset  in part  by a lower cost per unit due mainly to lower concentrate costs 
in the caribbean  cost of goods sold increased million  or percent  to million in from million in the prior year  driven mainly by unfavorable foreign currency translations and increased packaging and ingredient costs 
selling  delivery and administrative expenses 
in  sd a expenses increased million  or percent  to million from million in the prior year 
sd a expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to percent in from percent in the prior year  which was primarily attributable to the us operations 
us sd a expenses increased million to percent as a percentage of us net sales  from percent 
this increase was primarily attributable to additional depreciation expense  as we continued to focus on capital projects to enhance our overall operating performance  including the substantial completion of our inventory system deployment in we also continued to invest in our next generation selling system  which will allow us to convert a significant portion of our us distribution system to a pre sell environment 
increased us sd a expenses were also attributable to higher wages and benefits  due  in part  to the aligning of the compensation and benefit programs of the former pepsiamericas and whitman corporation  as well as the compensation expense related to the issuance of restricted stock awards in conjunction with our long term incentive programs see note to the consolidated financial statements 
sd a expenses in central europe increased million to million in the increase in sd a expenses was associated with the growth in volume  including new product introductions  offset  in part  by a decline in sd a expenses of approximately million related to foreign exchange translation 
central europe s sd a expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to percent from percent  mainly due to improved sd a expense containment in poland 
sd a expenses in the caribbean increased million to million in sd a expenses as a percentage of net sales remained relatively flat compared to the prior year for the caribbean 
amortization expense 
amortization expense declined million to million in  primarily due to the change in accounting for amortization expense for goodwill as a result of the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
special charges 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded special charges of million relating to the rollout of the changes in our marketing and distribution strategy in poland  the czech republic  and republic of slovakia 
the special charges included million related to severance and other benefits  million related to asset write downs  and million related primarily to lease termination costs 
consistent with the changes in hungary in  we modified our distribution method from a conventional direct store delivery to an alternative model using third party distributors in certain areas 
in  we also recorded an additional million of severance costs related to the fiscal year charge in special charges  net 
in  we identified approximately million of excess severance and related exit costs  including million relating to the hungary special charge recorded in fiscal  and million relating to previous special charges 
upon execution of the distribution and marketing strategy change in hungary  there were instances where no viable third party distributors were found in certain areas of hungary  and thus  an alternative strategy was not available in those areas 
the reversals of million were credited to income and reflected in special charges  net 
in  we recorded special charges of million in the fourth quarter for severance costs and other costs related to changing our marketing and distribution strategy in hungary  as well as for the write down of obsolete marketing equipment in the us we established a new centralized facility to refurbish our marketing equipment  which changed our criteria for determination of refurbishment versus disposal of our marketing equipment 
this change in criteria resulted in an impairment of certain marketing equipment 
in addition  we recorded a charge of million in the first quarter of related to further organizational changes resulting from the merger with the former pepsiamericas 
this charge was principally composed of severance and related benefits 
these changes in the marketing and distribution strategy in central europe  which resulted in special charges of and million in and  respectively  are expected to reduce costs  as well as to expand our market share by increasing our points of contact with the end customer 
we expect to realize approximately million to million in annual pretax savings across all of our markets in central europe  principally resulting from reductions in employee related and other distribution costs 
a portion of those savings were realized in hungary in the remaining benefits are expected to be realized in and  with the complete rollout of the new distribution strategy in poland  the czech republic  and republic of slovakia 
in  we recorded special charges of million  including million in costs for severance and other benefits and million of costs resulting from a decision to close our production facility in ft 
wayne  indiana 
the charge for the closure of the production facility included a write down of building and equipment and million for severance payments and other benefits 
during and  pepsiamericas paid employee benefits of and million  respectively  related to charges recorded in and  which included the elimination of approximately positions in total 
the payments made during and included deferred severance payments made to previously terminated employees 
at the end of fiscal year  million of employee related costs were accrued in current liabilities  as we expect to pay substantially all of these costs during the next twelve months 
operating income 
operating income increased million to million in  primarily related to the impact of the change in accounting for goodwill  which reduced amortization expense by million in excluding the impact of the change in accounting for goodwill  operating income decreased million in  as a result of lower operating income in the us and increased operating losses in the caribbean markets  which were offset  in part  by a reduction in central europe s operating losses 
excluding the impact of the change in accounting for goodwill  us operating income declined million due mainly to higher sd a expenses 
the increase in sd a expenses related to higher depreciation expense associated with various information technology initiatives and to increased compensation and benefits expenses 
in  we had recorded special charges of million in the us  offset  in part  by an million pension curtailment gain 
central europe reduced its operating losses by million to an operating loss of million in the reduction in operating losses was mainly attributable to strong volume growth and the impact of foreign exchange translation  as well as cost containment in cost of goods sold and sd a expenses 
lower special charges contributed to million of the overall reduction in operating losses in central europe  as the hungary special charge was million in  compared to net special charges of million recorded in central europe in favorable foreign exchange rates contributed million of the reduction in operating losses in the operating losses in the caribbean increased by million to million in  due mainly to the percent decline in volume 
the markets in the caribbean were adversely impacted in the latter part of and in early by a decline in tourism 
the general decline in tourism resulted from the events occurring on september  we continue to consider various strategic alternatives in the caribbean markets in an effort to decrease our operating losses  as the macroeconomic and political conditions in the caribbean continue to pose operational challenges 
interest and other expenses 
net interest expense decreased million to million in from million in this decrease was principally due to lower interest rates on short term borrowings 
in addition  we adjusted the mix of our fixed rate versus floating rate debt using interest rate swap agreements  which favorably impacted interest expense in we reported other expense  net  of million in  compared to other expense  net  of million in the pre tax gain of million resulting from the sale of a parcel of land in downtown chicago was included in the results for in  the results included the benefit of certain real estate tax refunds associated with our non operating real estate entities 
income taxes 
the effective income tax rate  which is income tax expense expressed as a percentage of income from continuing operations before income taxes  was percent in  compared to percent in the decrease in the effective tax rate in was primarily due to the elimination of the amortization of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets in conjunction with the implementation of sfas no 
 as a majority of the amortization expense was not deductible for tax purposes 
income from continuing operations 
income from continuing operations increased million  or percent  to million in from million in the improvement in income from continuing operations reflected the impact of the change in accounting for goodwill  lower interest expense and a reduction in the effective income tax rate  as discussed previously 
discontinued operations 
loss from discontinued operations after taxes of million in represented a million charge for the purchase of certain insurance policies concerning the environmental liabilities related to the previously sold subsidiaries 
in  loss from discontinued operations after taxes of million represented a pretax charge of million to recognize additional liabilities associated with our indemnification obligations for environmental liabilities related to previously sold subsidiaries 
this additional charge resulted from conducting a comprehensive review of all former facilities operated by these previously sold subsidiaries  which was initiated in connection with the insurance policies purchased in we expect to spend approximately million to million in for environmental remediation and other related costs see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of discontinued operations and related environmental liabilities 
net income 
net income increased million to million in from million in the improvement in net income resulted from higher income from continuing operations  up million  and the lower losses from discontinued operations  lower by million 
the factors that impacted both continuing and discontinued operations were discussed previously 
operating results compared with due to the merger with the former pepsiamericas completed in november  we believe that comparison to pro forma results for for net sales and cost of goods sold provides a better indication of current operating trends than reported results 
therefore  included within the following discussion are explanations of both reported results and the pro forma results for net sales and cost of goods sold 
pro forma operating results  as well as the volume comparisons  assume the merger with the former pepsiamericas occurred at the beginning of volume 
in  total volume increased percent including us volume growth of percent  central europe volume growth of percent and caribbean volume growth of percent 
in the us  the decline of approximately two percent in trademark pepsi products was offset by strong volume growth in mountain dew  aquafina and sierra mist 
trademark mountain dew volume grew percent  driven by both regular mountain dew and mountain dew code red 
flavored soft drinks increased approximately percent  primarily due to an increase in sierra mist  while aquafina volume grew nearly percent 
we experienced package volume growth in both single serve and take home packages  led by ounce plastic containers and and ounce non returnable packages 
this increase was a result of significant growth in the channel performance of both supercenters and mass retailers 
central europe volume grew percent compared to the prior year 
the increase was primarily related to the increase in water volumes  while total carbonated soft drink volume growth was relatively flat 
both water and carbonated soft drinks experienced growth in the multi serve pet packages  primarily in the large format and wholesale channels  while small format volume declined 
volume in the caribbean increased percent in compared to this increase resulted from increases in trademark pepsi products  as well as increases in aquafina  seven up and other local flavored brands 
net sales 
net sales for and were as follows in millions reported reported change us   central europe caribbean total net sales   reported pro forma change unaudited us   central europe caribbean total net sales   on a reported basis  net sales increased by million  or percent  in compared with  primarily reflecting sales contributed by the additional territories acquired in the merger with the former pepsiamericas  as well as the acquisition of the trinidad and tobago territory  both in the fourth quarter of the balance of the growth in net sales reflected improved pricing and slightly higher volumes in the us markets 
on a pro forma basis  net sales increased by million  or percent 
the growth in net sales included an increase in us net sales of million  an increase in central europe net sales of million and an increase in caribbean net sales of million 
excluding sales contributed in and by the beer operations  which we sold in the first quarter of  us net sales increased million  or percent 
the increase in us net sales resulted from a percent improvement in net pricing and a percent increase in volume 
on a reported as well as pro forma basis  central europe net sales remained relatively flat in compared to the contribution to net sales from the percent volume growth  an increase in net pricing  as well as the favorable foreign currency translation impact of approximately million  were offset  in part  by a reduction in contract sales  and the planned reduction of private label revenue 
the caribbean pro forma net sales increased million  or percent  which can be partially attributed to the full year impact of net sales for trinidad and tobago in cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold for and were as follows in millions reported reported change us   central europe caribbean total cost of goods sold   reported pro forma change unaudited us   central europe caribbean total cost of goods sold   the consolidated cost of goods sold on a reported basis increased million to  million in  primarily reflecting cost of goods sold of the additional territories acquired in the merger with the former pepsiamericas  as well as the acquisition of the trinidad and tobago territory in december the balance of the cost of goods sold increase related primarily to higher concentrate as well as increases in other ingredient and package costs associated with changes in the mix of products sold 
on a pro forma comparison basis  consolidated cost of goods sold increased million  or percent  in  mainly attributable to the increase in pro forma us cost of goods sold of million  or percent 
us cost of goods sold increased percent due to the percent volume growth discussed above  as well as an increase in cost per unit of percent which excludes the impact of the divested beer business 
the increase in the cost per unit was attributed to higher concentrate costs  as well as an increase in packaging costs 
the increase in packaging costs was primarily related to our shift in the mix of product sold in non returnable pet containers supporting aquafina and other non carbonated beverage growth 
on a reported as well as pro forma basis  central europe cost of goods sold decreased approximately million  or percent 
the cost of goods sold decrease was related to a lower cost per unit  offset  in part  by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translations 
on a pro forma basis  caribbean cost of goods sold increased percent  due mainly to the full year impact of cost of goods sold for trinidad and tobago in selling  delivery and administrative expenses 
selling  delivery and administrative expenses increased million to million in primarily related to sd a expenses incurred in the additional territories of the former pepsiamericas 
as a percentage of net sales  sd a expenses decreased to percent in from percent in sd a expenses in the us increased million to million in  compared to million in as a percentage of net sales  sd a expenses increased to percent in from percent in the increase in us sd a expenses was driven  in part  by increased costs associated with the growth in aquafina and other non carbonated beverage offerings  as well as new product introductions 
increased sd a expenses in the us were also driven by higher depreciation expense due to the previous investment in cold drink equipment  inventory systems and information technology 
these investments were associated with the integration of the former pepsiamericas and heartland territories 
in addition  the next generation selling system was in the early stages of development in as expected  the benefits of the merger with the former pepsiamericas were offset almost entirely by non recurring integration costs of approximately million to million 
sd a expenses in central europe decreased million to million in  compared to million in as a percentage of net sales  sd a expenses decreased to percent in from percent in  mainly due to cost improvements 
caribbean sd a expenses increased million to million in  due to the sd a expenses of the additional territories jamaica and puerto rico related to the merger with former pepsiamericas  as well as the acquisition of trinidad and tobago territories  in the fourth quarter of sd a expenses as a percentage of net sales was percent in  compared with percent in amortization expense 
amortization expense increased million to million in  primarily due to the increased amortization related to the goodwill recorded for the merger with the former pepsiamericas in november gain on pension curtailment 
in connection with the integration of the former whitman corporation and former pepsiamericas us benefit plans during the first quarter of  pepsiamericas amended its pension plans to freeze pension benefit accruals for substantially all salaried and non union employees effective december  employees age or older with or more years of vesting service were grandfathered such that they will continue to accrue benefits after december  based on their final average pay as of december  as a result of this plan amendment  we recognized a one time curtailment gain of million 
the existing us salaried and non union pension plans were replaced by an additional pepsiamericas contribution to the k plan beginning january  operating income 
in  operating income increased million to million  which primarily reflected the additional operating income contributed by the us territories of the former pepsiamericas 
the us operating income included a gain on pension curtailment of million in and special charges of million and million in and  respectively 
excluding the gain on pension curtailment and the special charges  the us operating income increased million  or percent 
the operating income contributed by the former pepsiamericas territories was primarily responsible for the improved us results  offset  in part  by higher sd a expenses 
the central europe operating losses increased to million in  from million in  due mainly to the special charges recorded in of million  offset  in part  by improved operating performance in  including volume growth and the reduction of sd a expenses as a percentage of net sales 
the caribbean had operating losses of million in  compared to operating income of million in interest and other expenses 
net interest expense increased million in to million 
the increase was due principally to an increase in the average outstanding net debt resulting from the merger with the former pepsiamericas  partially offset by lower borrowing costs resulting from the refinancing of debt in the first quarter of  the swap of a portion of our debt portfolio from fixed rate to floating rate  and lower overall interest rates on short term borrowings 
we reported other expense  net  of million in compared with other income of million in included in other income in was a gain of million resulting from the sale of the franchise operations in the baltics 
absent this gain  other expense was million unfavorable to  which was not attributed to any individually significant item 
income taxes 
the effective income tax rate was percent in  compared to percent in income from continuing operations 
income from continuing operations increased million or percent  to million in from million in the improvement in income from continuing operations primarily reflected the income contributed by the former pepsiamericas territories  a reduction in effective income tax rate  as well as the gain on pension curtailment primarily recorded in  as previously discussed 
discontinued operations 
loss from discontinued operations after taxes of million in represented a charge of million for environmental liabilities related to a former subsidiary  pneumo abex  which was previously discussed in this md a 
income from discontinued operations after taxes of million in resulted from the reversal of prior accruals resulting from certain insurance settlements for environmental matters related to pneumo abex  partially offset by increased environmental and related accruals 
net income 
net income decreased million to million in from million in the decline in net income resulted mainly from the million loss from discontinued operations recorded in  as income from continuing operations increased million from to the factors that impacted both continuing and discontinued operations were discussed previously 
liquidity and capital resources we own a special purpose entity  whitman finance  which has entered into an agreement the securitization with a major us financial institution to sell an undivided interest in its receivables 
the agreement involves the sale of receivables by certain of our us subsidiaries to whitman finance  which in turn sells an undivided interest in a revolving pool of receivables to the financial institution see note to the consolidated financial statements 
net cash provided by continuing operations increased by million to million in the increase in cash provided by continuing operations was due  in part  to the reduction in the cash outlay related to special charges 
in the current year  we paid million related to special charges  compared to million in the prior year 
we estimate approximately million to million of additional special charges in central europe in for the changes in the marketing and distribution strategy  with approximately half of this range relating to cash outflows 
in the us we are reviewing our cost structure and expect to record special charges in the first quarter of these charges are expected to be in the range of approximately million to million 
in addition  we contributed million to our pension plan in fiscal years and we are million underfunded in our pension plan as of the end of fiscal year we do not believe that any known trends or uncertainties related to our pension plan will result in a material change in our results of operations  financial condition  or our liquidity

we made capital investments of million in  up million from capital investments of million in capital spending increased slightly in due to increased spending in the developing non us markets for facility and information technology improvements  offset  in part  by declines in us capital fleet and information technology spending  as the next generation selling system nears completion 
capital spending in  excluding potential acquisitions  is expected to be in the range of million to million 
in addition  in  we received million in cash and a million promissory note collateralized by a subordinated mortgage related to the sale of a parcel of land in downtown chicago 
an additional million  otherwise payable to us  was held back in escrow  a portion of which is expected to be recovered when certain conditions are met related to existing environmental matters

the proceeds were used to pay down commercial paper 
we have revolving credit agreements with maximum borrowings of million  which act as back up for our commercial paper program  accordingly  we have a total of million available under our commercial paper program and revolving credit facility combined 
there were no commercial paper borrowings as of the end of fiscal year in august  we announced that we would resume purchasing our common stock under a previously authorized repurchase program 
in december  the board authorized an additional million shares for our repurchase program 
as of fiscal year end  million shares remained available for repurchase 
we repurchased million shares of our common stock in and million shares in for million and million  respectively  however  at the end of  million of treasury stock purchases were unsettled and included in other accrued expenses in the consolidated balance sheet 
we paid cash dividends of million in based on an annual cash dividend of per share  compared with million paid in  based on the same dividend rate 
the issuance of common stock  including treasury shares  for the exercise of stock options resulted in cash inflows of million in  compared with million in we believe that with our existing operating cash flows  available lines of credit and potential for additional debt and equity offerings  we will have sufficient resources to fund our future growth and expansion 
we continue to be subject to certain indemnification obligations  net of insurance  under agreements related to previously sold subsidiaries  including indemnification expenses for potential environmental and tort liabilities of these prior subsidiaries 
there is significant uncertainty in assessing our potential expenses for complying with our indemnification obligations 
the assessment and determination of expenses for cleanup at the various sites involved are inherently speculative during the early stages  as is the projection of future claims 
the amount of the expense also is subject to various factors  including possible insurance recoveries and the allocation of liabilities among many other potentially responsible and financially viable parties 
during  we paid million related to such indemnification obligations  net of any insurance settlements 
at the end of fiscal year  we had recorded approximately million in liabilities for future remediation and other related costs arising out of our indemnification obligations of previously sold businesses 
we expect to spend approximately million to million in for remediation and other related costs see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of discontinued operations and related environmental liabilities 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in the fourth quarter of  we adopted emerging issues task force eitf issue  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer or a reseller of the vendor s products 
eitf addresses the classification on the income statement of certain consideration paid to a reseller or another party that purchases our products 
as a result  net sales were reduced by million in  million in  and million in  with sd a expenses reduced by the same amounts 
prior period amounts were reclassified to conform to the current year presentation  including prior quarters in and see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in november  the eitf reached a consensus on several points in issue  accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor that are effective in the first quarter of eitf requires that certain consideration received from a vendor by a customer be recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold  unless the payment is directly attributable offsetting to expenses incurred elsewhere in the income statement 
we anticipate that eitf will have an impact on the income statement classification of certain bottler incentives  however  we have not yet quantified the impact of such reclassification as the marketing support programs have not yet been finalized 
the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 recission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections in under sfas no 
 all gains and losses from extinguishment of debt were required to be aggregated and  if material  classified as an extraordinary item  net of related income tax effect 
this statement eliminates sfas no 
and thus  the criteria in accounting principles board apb opinion no 
should be applied to determine the classification of gains and losses related to the extinguishment of debt 
the statement is effective beginning in fiscal year at that time  any gain or loss on the extinguishment of debt that was classified as an extraordinary item in prior periods presented that does not meet the criteria in apb opinion no 
for classification as an extraordinary item will be reclassified see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which nullifies eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured at fair value when the liability is incurred  as opposed to the date management committed to an exit plan 
the special charges in the fourth quarter of related to the marketing and distribution strategy changes in central europe were recorded in compliance with eitf  as the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
we are subject to various market risks  including risks from changes in commodity prices  interest rates and currency exchange rates 
commodity prices 
the risk from commodity price changes correlates to our ability to recover higher product costs through price increases to customers  which may be limited due to the competitive pricing environment that exists in the soft drink business 
we use derivative financial instruments to hedge price fluctuations for a portion of our aluminum and fuel requirements 
each instrument hedges price fluctuations on a portion of our aluminum can and fuel requirements over a specified period of time 
because of the high correlation between aluminum and fuel commodity prices and our contractual cost of these products  we consider these hedges to be highly effective 
as of fiscal year end  we have hedged a portion of our future us aluminum requirements into fiscal year additionally  we had no outstanding fuel hedge contracts as of fiscal year end interest rates 
our floating rate exposure relates to changes in the six month london interbank offered rate libor and the overnight federal funds rate 
assuming consistent levels of floating rate debt with those held as of fiscal year end  a basis point change in each of these rates would have an impact of approximately million on our annual interest expense 
in the third quarter of  we entered into interest rate swaps to convert a portion of our fixed rate debt to floating rate 
in  we had short term investments throughout a majority of the year  principally invested in money market funds and commercial paper  which were most closely tied to the overnight federal funds rate 
the amount of these investments was not significant throughout the year 
assuming a basis point change in the rate of interest associated with our short term investments  interest income would not have changed by a significant amount 
currency exchange rates 
because we operate in non us franchise territories  we are subject to exposure resulting from changes in currency exchange rates 
currency exchange rates are influenced by a variety of economic factors including local inflation  growth  interest rates and governmental actions  as well as other factors 
we currently do not hedge the translation risks of investments in our non us operations 
any positive cash flows generated have been reinvested in the operations  excluding repayments of intercompany loans from the manufacturing operations in poland 
based on net sales  non us operations represented approximately percent of our total operations in changes in currency exchange rates impact the translation of the non us operations results from their local currencies into us dollars 
if the currency exchange rates had changed by five percent in  we estimate the impact on reported operating income would have been approximately million 
our estimate reflects the fact that a portion of the non us operations costs are denominated in non us dollars  including concentrate purchases 
this estimate does not take into account the possibility that rates can move in opposite directions and that gains in one category may or may not be offset by losses from another category
