commerce one s services operations support these software solutions and help companies take maximum advantage of the efficiencies that these solutions can offer 
together  our software and services allow companies to automate business functions that traditionally involved costly and time consuming phone calls and paperwork 
in the fourth quarter of  we released the beta version of the commerce one conductor tm platform  a web services based platform designed to simplify automation of business processes  which is intended to be our primary product offering 
the commerce one conductor platform was released for general availability in march of we were founded as distrivision in  changed our name to commerce one in  and re incorporated into delaware in on july   we reorganized into a holding company structure 
as part of the reorganization  the stockholders of the old commerce one now our wholly owned subsidiary commerce one operations  inc became stockholders of the new commerce one

source of revenues we generate revenues from multiple sources 
license fees are generated from licensing our software solutions primarily to end user organizations through our direct sales force  and  to a lesser extent  to certain third party product distributors and resellers primarily in international locations 
services revenues are generated from professional consulting  software maintenance  revenue sharing arrangements with customers  and other related services 
revenues from revenue sharing arrangements have not been a significant portion of total services revenues to date and are not expected to be significant in the future 
in  and the first quarter of  we downsized our global services division  which provides professional services to third parties  through reductions in force and divestitures 
although consulting services remain a substantial portion of our revenues  these actions have contributed to a general decline in the overall revenues received from our consulting services in the past several quarters 
we expect this decline in revenue to continue through at least the first quarter of the portion of our license and service revenues attributable to sales outside the united states continues to be a substantial portion of our overall revenues 
in  approximately of our license and service revenues were derived from sales outside united states  compared to in for the year ended december   transactions with sap accounted for approximately of our total revenues and transactions with one customer accounted for of the company s total revenues compared to the year ended december  where transactions with sap accounted for of the company s total revenues 
for the years ended and  no other customer accounted for more than of the company s total revenues 
additionally  for the year ended december   no customer accounted for more than of the company s total revenues 
significant trends affecting our business industry dynamics decline in enterprise spending 
the enterprise software industry is characterized by several trends that may have a material impact on our strategic planning  results of operations and financial condition 
one key trend has been the decline in spending on enterprise software as a result of the weakened global economy and uncertainty due to recent international events 
this decline in enterprise spending has had a direct and significant adverse impact on our ability to generate license revenues from new and existing customers 
the decline in spending has also been coupled with increased competition in our industry resulting in significant downward pricing pressure on our products 
taken together  these trends have resulted in a significant reduction in new sales and declining average selling prices for the products we do sell 
new product introduction 
we launched the commerce one conductor platform  our new product  in march of however  due to the recent timing of this release and the length of our sales cycle that can take an average of four to six months  it could take several quarters before we receive significant license revenue from this product  if at all 
in the interim  it may be difficult to sell our supplier relationship management applications  due to customer concerns over committing to such applications in light of the new commerce one conductor release 
if we are not successful in selling commerce one conductor to current and new customers  our license revenues will be adversely affected 
dependence on sap loss of future sap revenues 
we have historically relied for a substantial portion of our license revenue on our relationship with sap 
in  sap accounted for million of our million in license revenue 
in addition  sap has been an important source of new customers for us by providing us with an opportunity to sell our products to the relatively large installed base of sap customers 
as discussed in more detail in the section below called relationship with sap  we received no license revenue from sap in the fourth quarter of and do not expect to derive any significant revenues from sap in  or thereafter  or to have direct access through sap to its installed based of customers 
cash flows from operations 
we have undertaken and are continuing to pursue a number of measures to reduce cash related expenses that affect our cash flows from operations 
these measures include significant headcount reduction  renegotiating our real estate lease obligations and divesting certain businesses that we believe are not critical to our core product initiatives 
while these efforts helped reduce total expenses from cost of sales  sales and marketing  product development  and general and administrative expenses from  million in to million in  our operations are still drawing upon our cash reserves 
if we do not significantly decrease our cash expenses  increase cash revenues or obtain additional financing  we will continue to have significant negative cash flows from operations 
liquidity 
we had cash and cash equivalents and investments of approximately million at december   of which million was unrestricted cash and short term investments that can be used to fund operations 
in the quarter ended march   we expect that our operations will use approximately million of our cash reserves 
based upon our current plans and expectations for revenues and expenses  we believe that our available cash resources will be sufficient to finance our presently anticipated operating losses and working capital expenditure requirements through the calendar year 
however  plans and future events are inherently uncertain 
should our levels of revenue particularly our license revenues pertaining to our new commerce one conductor platform product and cash  cash equivalents and investments fall short of our expectations  we will take action to further reduce our operating expenses  primarily through reductions of personnel related costs  and we believe such action  if needed  will allow us to have sufficient cash to finance our expected operating losses and working capital requirements through the calendar year 
the forecasts of the periods of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations and the forecasts regarding our ability to reduce our expenses to allow us to have adequate cash resources through are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary materially as a result of various factors  including without limitation our ability to sell and gain acceptance in the market of our new commerce one conductor platform product  our ability to significantly reduce our real estate lease obligations  our future revenues and expenses  growth or contraction of operations and general economic pressures and other factors described in the section entitled risk factors 
see liquidity and capital resources 
revenue mix 
our business model relies on our ability to generate revenue from license fees and  to a lesser extent  from the services we provide 
revenues from license fees  though a lower overall percentage of our revenues  have relatively higher gross margins than revenues from services 
because our revenue from license fees has declined more significantly than service revenue  the percentage of our revenues from the sale of lower margin services increased in we expect this trend to continue in the short term unless we are able to successfully generate significant sales of our commerce one conductor platform product  which was released in march critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  we evaluate estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  software product returns  warranty obligations  uncollectible accounts receivable and long lived assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about amount and timing of revenues and expenses  the carrying values of assets and the recorded amounts of liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates and such estimates may change if the underlying conditions or assumptions change 
we believe that these significant judgments affect the following critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and related accounting policies our revenue recognition policies are consistent with statement of position software revenue recognition  as modified by statement of position revenues from license agreements for our software products are recognized upon delivery of the software if there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  collection is probable and the fee is fixed or determinable 
in the limited circumstances where our software is licensed to third parties through indirect sales channels primarily in international locations  license fees are generally recognized as revenue  under the sell through method  when the criteria described above have been met and the reseller has sold the software to an end user customer 
while generally we do not license software under barter or concurrent arrangements  whenever software has been licensed under such arrangements  we have recognized revenue equal to the net monetary amounts to be received by us 
we reduce license revenue to reflect estimated product returns 
while as a matter of contract and general practice  we do not accept the return of software products after the expiration of any acceptance periods  unforeseen contractual disputes with customers may require us to accept the return of a product 
management uses a percentage of trailing license revenue in order to calculate the required reserve balance 
the appropriate percentage is determined by analyzing information pertaining to past customer issues or disputes for particular products 
our reserves have decreased significantly over the past twelve months due to lower license revenue 
should our actual product returns be greater than our estimates  revisions to the product return allowance would be required which may lead to a decrease in license revenue 
we charge estimated product warranty costs to cost of licenses at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes prior to the release of software  unforeseen product errors may exist in our products that may require us to incur costs to correct or replace the affected products 
we create the warranty reserve by analyzing actual work performed pursuant to warranty disputes in previous quarters  the mix of our product offerings and the relative amount of time those products have been generally available 
should warranty claims  and therefore our actual costs  be greater than our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty costs would be required which may lead to an increase in cost of license for the affected period 
revenues from professional services contracts are generally recognized on a time and material basis 
however  when we perform work on a fixed price basis  revenue is recognized on the percentage of completion method  with costs and estimated profits recorded as work is performed 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
changes in contract performance and estimated profitability  including final contract settlements  may result in revisions to costs and revenues  which are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
if a customer transaction includes both software license and services elements  or the rights to multiple software products  the total arrangement fee is allocated to each of the elements using the residual method  under which revenue is allocated to undelivered elements based on vendor specific objective evidence of the fair values of such undelivered elements and the residual amounts of revenue are allocated to the delivered elements 
revenue is recognized using contract accounting for arrangements involving significant customization or modifications of the software or where professional services are considered necessary to the functionality of the software 
revenue from these software and services arrangements is recognized using the percentage of completion method by utilizing specific milestones in order to assess the progress achieved 
software maintenance revenues and subscription fees are recognized ratably over the term of the related contract  typically one year 
network service fees transaction fees  hosting fees and revenue sharing  have not been significant and are not expected to be material in the future 
revenues related to transaction fees and revenue sharing are recognized as earned based on customer transactions 
revenues related to hosting fees are recognized ratably over the term of the related contracts  typically one year 
deferred revenue consists of prepaid licenses fees as well as prepaid fees for services  subscription fees  and maintenance and support agreements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
factors that management considers in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts include the current credit worthiness of the customer  prior payment history and the age of the receivables 
we will periodically assess whether our realization differs substantially from our estimates to refine our assumptions 
during  we decreased the balance of our allowance for doubtful accounts primarily due to a decrease in our accounts receivable balance related to an overall revenue decline 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make such payments  increases in the allowance may be required 
long lived assets and goodwill in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we periodically assess the carrying value of our long lived assets including property and equipment  goodwill  our technology agreement with covisint and other identified intangible assets for impairment 
an impairment assessment is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment indicators include  but are not limited to  our net book value as compared to market capitalization  significant negative industry and economic trends  a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period and significant under performance relative to historical and projected future operating results 
in assessing the recoverability of the current carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets  we must make assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows attributable to these assets 
in addition we must make assumptions regarding discount rates to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
we have typically relied on valuation experts to assist in the analysis of these factors 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded which could have a significant impact on our operating results 
in  we recorded impairment charges of million related to property and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets 
restructuring accrual we have undergone multiple restructuring transactions during and in accordance with emerging issues task force issue referred to as eitf no 
liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  the cost associated with these transactions have been charged to restructuring expense in the period in which we committed to the restructuring plan 
the charges relating to the consolidation and closing of facilities and asset dispositions required significant estimates to determine the amount of future payments to be accrued as a part of the restructuring activity 
a change in the circumstances related to the plan for closure of the facilities could result in additional charges or the reversal of prior charges taken 
due primarily to negotiated lease terminations for space vacated due to various restructurings  amounts previously charged to restructuring costs of approximately million were reversed during the quarter ended december   reducing the net expense for restructuring recorded in the quarter ending december  in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force referred to as eitf issue no 
liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred  not at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan  as required under eitf issue no 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the adoption of sfas no 
may affect the timing of recognizing future restructuring costs and the amounts recognized under such costs 
relationship with sap commercial relationship commerce one has had a strategic relationship with sap since over the course of the relationship  sap has accounted for a significant portion of our license revenue 
however  the relationship has changed significantly over time 
as a result of these changes and changes in the marketplace  the revenues we derive from our relationship with sap have declined substantially 
we do not expect to derive significant revenues  if any  from sap in or thereafter 
to the extent we do receive any revenues from sap in the future  we expect that such revenues will relate to ongoing maintenance and support fees as opposed to license fees 
commerce one s strategic relationship with sap commenced on september   when the company entered into a strategic alliance agreement with sap ag to jointly develop  market and sell the marketset suite of applications and the enterprise buyer procurement applications 
these products were primarily targeted at electronic marketplace customers  a market which has since declined substantially 
this agreement provided that either party licensing the jointly developed products to its customers would owe a royalty to the other party 
the amount of the royalty was generally based on a percentage of the total license fee paid by the customer 
sap historically has made non refundable royalty prepayments to commerce one  which the company has recorded as deferred revenue as payments are received 
as sap incurs the obligation to pay royalties to commerce one  these royalties are credited against this deferred revenue and recognized as revenue by commerce one 
prepayments received from sap and included in deferred revenue totaled approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
when commerce one licenses one of the jointly developed products to its customers  it pays a royalty to sap in connection with the sale 
these royalty payments are recorded as a reduction of license or support revenue  as appropriate 
in  and  we made royalty payments to sap of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
during  commerce one and sap amended these agreements to provide for different rights to resell certain technology included in the jointly developed products and for varying royalty rates and maintenance fees depending on the particular product  category of customer and other factors 
effective january   the company amended its strategic alliance agreement with sap to simplify its royalty payment provisions and to provide sap with an unlimited right to resell the jointly developed products on a fixed fee basis  as well as a right to resell certain other commerce one technology on an original equipment manufacturer basis  for the first three quarters of in exchange  sap reported to us a total of approximately million  primarily attributable to license fees  as well as related support and maintenance 
we credited the aggregate fee of approximately million against the prior prepayments by sap  which had been recorded as deferred revenue 
commerce one recognized the license and maintenance revenue ratably over the three quarter period ending september  the amendment provided that during this three quarter period  commerce one would pay sap a royalty fee based upon a fixed percentage of the total license fee for jointly developed products sold by commerce one  if any 
the amendment further provided that the agreement would default to the historical royalty structure in the event the parties failed to agree on a new payment schedule by september  commerce one and sap have not renegotiated the royalty payments  and therefore the parties will revert to the historical royalty structure when payments  if any  are due 
the parties entered into a subsequent amendment effective december  in which the parties clarified commerce one s support obligations for prior versions of the marketset product  granted reciprocal rights to distribute certain connector technology related to the marketset product on a royalty free basis  and resolved certain outstanding payment issues relating to services and maintenance fees for certain joint customers 
sap s license royalty payments to commerce one historically have constituted a substantial portion of the company s revenues  including during and historically  sap was instrumental in assisting us with selling the jointly developed products  marketset and enterprise buyer  to sap s customer base 
however  these royalty payments have declined in the past year with the decline of the market for electronic marketplace solutions 
in  and  sap reported royalties to us of approximately million  million and million  respectively  of which license revenues were approximately million  million and million  respectively 
commerce one and sap have each phased out the jointly developed enterprise buyer procurement products and replaced such products with its own successor procurement products 
as a result  corresponding revenues received from sap for the sale of such products have ceased  and we do not expect to receive any future revenues from the sale of these products by sap 
similarly  revenues from the marketset product  primarily targeted at the electronic marketplace sector  have declined substantially and we do not expect to receive significant future license revenues  if any  from the sale of this product by sap 
accordingly  and as a result of the expiration of the fixed fee arrangement referenced above  commerce one does not anticipate that it will continue to generate significant revenues  if any  from sap in or thereafter 
the company also has generated revenue from its relationship with sap by performing professional services as a subcontractor to sap  primarily on software implementation engagements where the company has jointly sold marketset or enterprise buyer to an sap customer 
sap also has completed professional services for the company by acting as a subcontractor  primarily in relation to the jointly sold marketset or enterprise buyer products 
these revenues and expenses have declined over time and we expect they will continue to decline commensurate with the decline in license sales of the parties joint solutions 
the company also has generated revenue from its relationship with sap by providing technical customer support and maintenance services to joint customers 
in  support of such customers represented a substantial percentage of the company s total support and maintenance revenue 
amounts received from sap include payments based on a certain percentage of total support and maintenance fees received by sap from the customer 
in addition  we amended the strategic alliance agreement on january  to provide that sap would pay us  per quarter for certain support obligations relating to marketset 
under the terms of that agreement  the fixed payment is scheduled to cease on september  as a result  and as a result of the decline in license sales of the parties joint solutions  we expect revenues received from sap for technical support and maintenance to decline substantially in if we are unable to replace such revenues with substantial support and maintenance revenue related to the sale of our new products  our overall revenues will be harmed 
equity relationship at the time we entered into the strategic alliance agreement with sap in  we sold  shares of our common stock to sap for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
subsequently  in  we sold an additional  shares of our common stock to sap for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
in connection with our issuance of common stock to sap  we entered into various agreements that restrict sap s ability to acquire more than of our outstanding common stock or otherwise attempt to acquire control of commerce one  restrict its transfer of the shares of common stock that it purchased from us and  in very limited ways  affect sap s ability to vote its shares of our common stock 
we also granted sap certain rights to require us to register the resale of its shares of our common stock  certain pro rata rights to acquire additional shares of our common stock and the right to have a designee appointed to our board of directors or to send an observer to our board of directors meetings 
as of december   sap has not exercised its right to have such a designee appointed  but has exercised its right to send an observer to our board of directors meetings 
as of december   through its purchases from us and on the open market  sap beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
liquidity and capital resources we had cash and cash equivalents and investments of approximately million at december  compared to approximately million at december  the amounts as of december  included approximately million that collateralized certain of our obligations related to operating lease agreements for computer equipment and office facilities  potential workers compensation claims and an outstanding note payable 
the amounts as of december  included approximately million that collateralized certain of our obligations related to operating lease agreements for office facilities  potential workers compensation claims and the guarantee of a personal home mortgage of an executive officer 
as of december   we had million in unrestricted cash and short term investments that could be used to fund our operations 
net cash used in operating activities net cash used in operating activities totaled approximately million for  as compared to net cash used in operating activities of approximately million and million for and  respectively 
cash used in operating activities for resulted primarily from the net loss in  excluding non cash charges for amortization  depreciation  and impairment charges for fixed assets  the equity investment held in covisint  goodwill and other intangible assets 
the payment of outstanding accounts payable  accrued compensation and other current liabilities  along with a decrease in deferred revenue contributed to additional cash used in operations 
net cash provided by investing activities net cash provided by investing activities totaled approximately million for  as compared to cash used in investing activities of million and million in and  respectively 
cash provided by investing activities related to the maturities of short term investments  proceeds from divestitures  and the sale of fixed assets 
this was partially offset by the purchase of short term investments and purchases of property and equipment 
our net capital expenditures were approximately million for  million for and million for our capital expenditures have historically consisted of purchases of computer hardware and software  office furniture and equipment and leasehold improvements 
net cash provided by financing activities net cash provided by financing activities totaled approximately million for  compared to million in and million in the cash provided in resulted from the exercise of employee stock options  stock purchased through the employee stock purchase plan and cash proceeds drawn from a note payable to silicon valley bank entered into during the fourth quarter of  offset by the payment of the outstanding balance of our loan from microsoft in the amount of million and the payment of the loan to a former officer that we assumed upon his termination 
the cash provided in resulted primarily from the million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock to sap  as well as proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of employee stock options and cash proceeds drawn from an interest free loan in connection with the alliance agreement entered into with microsoft corporation during the first quarter of the cash from financing in resulted primarily from the million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock to sap and the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of employee stock options 
contractual obligations the following summarizes our contractual obligations as of december   and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in certain future periods after december  in thousands total less than one year to years years and thereafter non cancelable operating lease obligations silicon valley bank note payable total real estate obligations commerce one presently occupies office space in seven locations throughout the united states  although much of that space is underutilized 
in addition  we have lease commitments in seven other locations that we no longer use 
we have succeeded in subleasing some of our surplus office space 
however  the depressed real estate market has hindered our ability to find subtenants in several other locations  and much of our office space remains fully or partially vacant 
in a number of locations  including some which we still occupy  we have stopped paying rent as we attempt to renegotiate and or settle our lease obligations with various landlords 
as a consequence  some landlords have initiated litigation  and it is likely that others will file claims in the near future 
the pending litigation is described under item legal proceedings of this form k 
collectively  as of december   our long term non cancelable obligations for future rents payable through march were approximately million 
this amount includes million which was accrued as restructuring costs as of december  as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
of this amount  million represented unrestricted cash and short term investments 
during the quarter ended march   we expect that we will utilize approximately million of our cash reserves 
unless we achieve positive cash flow from our operations  we believe that our ability to renegotiate some or all of our lease obligations will materially impact our capability to fund our continuing operations 
in addition  if we are able to reach agreements with our various landlords to settle or reduce our real estate obligations  those agreements likely will require us to make significant cash payments to the landlords in the near term  which may have a material effect on our cash position 
we have no significant capital commitments or obligations other than those described in the analysis above 
we do not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
further  we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities nor have we any commitment or intent to provide additional funding to any such entity 
sources of liquidity and capital we have historically satisfied our cash requirements primarily through the issuances of equity securities and  to a significantly lesser extent  through debt financing 
on march   we entered into an alliance agreement with microsoft in connection with the marketing  promotion and optimization of commerce one products using microsoft technology 
to support the optimization  microsoft made a two year  interest free loan of million to us 
this loan was originally due on march  but would become immediately payable in the event we breached certain provisions of the loan agreement or alliance agreement 
on march   commerce one and microsoft terminated the alliance agreement and revised the terms of the loan agreement 
the note was repaid in full to microsoft on october  on october   we executed an agreement with silicon valley bank for a credit facility of up to million 
the loan facility is due by november  or upon the earlier default by commerce one  which is generally defined in the agreement to include the following failure to pay any obligation to silicon valley bank under the agreement within three days of the due date  failure of the company to maintain its legal existence and good standing where such failure could materially impact the value of the loan collateral  failure to provide certain financial information to the bank within the time periods prescribed by the contract  failure to pay taxes where such payment obligations are not subject to good faith dispute  the placement of any uncorrected material lien or seizure judgment against the company s assets  any material change in the value of the assets collateralizing the loan  the filing of an insolvency proceeding  any judgment or accelerated payment obligation exceeding  or a material misstatement or misrepresentation in the loan application 
the loan facility bears interest at a rate between one half and three quarters of a point below the silicon valley bank s prime rate at the time of the filing of this form k 
in the fourth quarter of  commerce one drew million against the credit facility 
all amounts drawn by commerce one are fully secured by a cash collateral account with silicon valley bank and as a result  the loan does not result in any net additional unencumbered cash to commerce one 
based upon our current plans and expectations for revenues and expenses  we believe that our available cash resources will be sufficient to finance our presently anticipated operating losses and working capital requirements through the calendar year 
sap has historically provided significant revenues to us million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we do not expect significant revenues from sap  if any  in we announced a restructuring on january   which will reduce the overall headcount to approximately by march  furthermore  we expect to use approximately million in cash to fund our operations in the first quarter of should our levels of revenue particularly our license revenues pertaining to our new commerce one conductor platform product and cash  cash equivalents and investments fall short of our expectations  we will take action to further reduce our operating expenses  primarily through reductions of personnel related costs  and we believe such action  if needed  will allow us to have sufficient cash to finance our expected operating losses and working capital requirements through the calendar year 
such actions may involve further reductions in force and other operating expense reductions 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors including our ability to sell and gain acceptance in the market of our new commerce one conductor platform product  our ability to significantly reduce our real estate lease obligations  our future revenues and expenses  growth or contraction of operations and general economic pressures 
we may need to seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or secure a bank line of credit 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities is likely to result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
we cannot assure you that any financing arrangements will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
the current unfavorable market for equity or debt financing makes it increasingly difficult to raise additional funding 
in addition  our ability to secure additional funding may largely depend on our ability to renegotiate our real estate obligations 
the forecasts of the periods of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations and the forecasts regarding our ability to reduce our expenses to allow us to have adequate cash resources through are forward looking statements that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary materially as a result of the factors described in this paragraph and in the section entitled risk factors 
results of operations the following table sets forth the results of operations for the company expressed as a percentage of total revenues for the years ended december   and the company s historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period

approximately million of our total million in license fees in was recorded as revenue from sap pursuant to the fixed fee arrangement with sap for the first three quarters of these fees were credited against prior prepayments to commerce one  which previously were recorded as deferred revenue 
as a result  such fees did not provide us with any net additional cash at the time the revenue was recognized 
direct license sales of our products  including our srm applications  represented a relatively small percentage of the total license fees for the fiscal year 
we expect a substantial decrease in license revenues in as compared to  as license revenues from sap are expected to be substantially decreased or eliminated  and sales of our current products are expected to decrease in light of the general release of the new commerce one conductor platform  as we introduce and develop the market for the commerce one conductor platform 
services revenues for decreased to million compared to million in and million in the percentage of our revenues attributable to professional services in decreased significantly compared to  but professional services remained the largest portion of our overall revenue 
this decrease resulted primarily from the downsizing of the global services division through reductions in force and divestitures of various global services divisions  a reduction in the amounts received from various historical revenue sharing arrangements  continued termination and reduction of support and maintenance agreements by existing customers  particularly our electronic marketplace customers  and a decrease in revenues from maintenance and hosting services commensurate with the overall decline in license revenues 
we expect that services revenues may decline further in the short term primarily as a result of the divestiture of our marketplace service division that took place in january and the decrease in the number of employees in our professional service division 
in addition  our new commerce one conductor platform product was released for general availability in march  and we do not expect it to generate significant services engagements or maintenance revenues in the short term until the product is more broadly used by our customers 
in january  we closed the sale of commerceone 
net  our marketplace services business  consisting of auction services  subscription services  content services and hosting services  to escout 
during  we recognized a total of approximately million in services revenue from commerceone 
net related services 
subsequent to this sale  commerce one no longer offers these services and therefore will not receive any future revenues related to these services 
payments received from our strategic alliance with sap constituted a substantial portion of our total revenues during the years  and total revenues received from sap were approximately million  million and million for the years  and  respectively  of which license revenues were approximately million  million and million 
we do not expect to receive significant revenues from sap in or thereafter

amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets totaled approximately million in  million in and million in the amortization of intangible assets resulted from the acquisitions of exterprise in and mergent and appnet during the decrease in amortization is a result of impairments of various intangible assets and also certain intangible assets being subsumed by goodwill as part of the adoption of sfas no 
business combinations 
goodwill is no longer amortized in accordance with sfas no 
see note of the consolidated financial statements incorporated herein by reference 
impairment of long lived and other intangible assets under sfas no 
 intangible assets with finite lives that continue to be amortized should be reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
an impairment assessment is required whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
during the quarter ended march   we identified indicators of possible impairment relating to the technology agreement with covisint 
the impairment indicators included  but were not limited to  significant negative industry and economic trends  which resulted in a reduction of forecasted cash flows related to the technology agreement 
in accordance with sfas no 
we performed  with the assistance of independent valuation experts  an impairment test of the carrying value of the technology agreement to determine whether any impairment existed 
we determined that the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows attributable to the technology agreement was less than its carrying value and that an impairment write down was required 
accordingly  we calculated the estimated fair value of the intangible asset by summing the present value of the expected cash flows over its life 
the impairment was calculated by deducting the present value of the expected cash flows from the carrying value 
this assessment resulted in an impairment write down of million in relation to the technology agreement  which was charged to cost of license fees during the quarter ended march  during the quarter ended december   we identified indicators of possible impairment relating to the covisint equity investment  property and equipment and intangible assets other than goodwill 
these indicators included  but were not limited to  a history of negative cash flows and operating losses and significant negative industry and economic trends 
we performed  with the assistance of independent valuation experts  an impairment test of the carrying value of these long lived and intangible assets to determine whether any impairment existed 
we determined that the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets was less than the carrying value of the assets and that an impairment existed 
we determined fair value for long lived assets by using market values when available 
if no market existed for the asset  we used independent valuation experts to calculate fair value as the sum of the discounted cash flows attributable to the assets 
the impairment was calculated by deducting the established fair value from the carrying value 
this assessment resulted in an impairment write down of million for property  plant  and equipment  million for intangible assets other than goodwill  and million for the covisint technology agreement during the quarter ended december  impairment of goodwill effective july   we adopted certain provisions of statement of financial standards sfas no 
 and effective january   we adopted the full provisions of sfas no 
and sfas no 
sfas no 
requires business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and broadens the criteria for recording intangible assets apart from goodwill 
we evaluated goodwill and other intangible assets acquired prior to june  using the transition criteria of sfas no 
 which resulted in million of other intangible assets comprised entirely of assembled workforce being subsumed into goodwill as of january  sfas no 
requires that purchased goodwill and certain indefinite lived intangible assets no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually 
sfas no 
prescribes a two phase process for impairment testing of goodwill 
the first phase  required to be completed by june   screens for impairment 
the second phase if necessary  required to be completed by december   measures the impairment 
we completed the first phase impairment analysis of goodwill during the first quarter of and found no instance of impairment of recorded goodwill 
during the fourth quarter of  we prepared our required sfas impairment test 
our fair value  established using the market method  was below its carrying value as of december   indicating that a potential impairment to goodwill existed 
we were then required to calculate the potential impairment by establishing the fair value of goodwill and subtracting this fair value from the carrying value of goodwill 
in accordance with fas no 
 the fair value of goodwill is an implied value 
the fair value of goodwill is calculated by subtracting the fair value of the net assets of commerce one other than goodwill from the fair value of commerce one 
the fair value of net assets includes determining the fair value of any unrecognized intangible assets 
we engaged an independent valuation firm to assist us in establishing fair values for any unrecognized intangible assets 
the impairment was then calculated by deducting the fair value of goodwill from the carrying value of goodwill 
this calculation resulted in an impairment write down of million 
interest income and other  net interest income and other  net  decreased by approximately million to million in from and increased by approximately million to million in from the decrease in interest income and other  net  for was primarily attributable to a lower average cash and investment balance in compared to  along with the general decline in average interest rates during the increase in from was due mainly to an increase in interest income due to higher average cash and investment balances during compared to provision for income taxes the income tax provision for  and is the result of withholding and income taxes generated in certain foreign jurisdictions 
realization of our net deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient taxable income in future years in appropriate tax jurisdictions to obtain benefit from the reversal of temporary differences and from net operating loss carryforwards 
due to the uncertainty of the amount and timing of future taxable income  we have provided a full valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s the following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could vary materially as a result of a number of factors including those set forth in risk factors beginning on page interest rate risk as of december   we had total restricted and unrestricted cash  highly liquid investments and short term investments of approximately million 
these investments may be subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates decrease 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in market interest rates by percent from the market interest rates at december  would cause the fair market value of our cash and cash equivalents to change by an immaterial amount 
declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our interest income 
as of december   all of the company s short term investments have a contractual maturity date that is less than one year from december  the following summarizes the fair value of the company s short term investments at december  amounts in thousands fair market value government notes and bonds certificates of deposit foreign currency exchange rate risk substantially all of our revenues recognized to date have been denominated in us dollars  a significant portion of which have been transacted with customers outside the united states 
to the extent that we engage in international sales denominated in us dollars  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products more expensive in international markets 
we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations and although we have never used financial hedging techniques to date  we may use them in the future to minimize the effect of these fluctuations 
nevertheless  we cannot assure you that these fluctuations will not harm our business in the future 
equity price risk from time to time  we have made investments in private companies  particularly private companies that are our strategic partners or customers 
as of december   our investment in private companies had a carrying value of approximately million 
if these companies do not complete initial public offerings or are not acquired by publicly traded companies or for cash  we may not be able to liquidate these investments 
in addition  even if we are able to sell these investments we cannot assure you that we will recoup our investment or that we will not be required to sell these investments at a loss 
we have sold certain investments at a loss over the past year 
the recent general decline in the nasdaq stock market s national market and the market prices of publicly traded technology companies  as well as any potential further declines in the future  will continue to adversely affect our ability to realize a return of our capital on most of these investments
