item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements and risk certain statements in this report  including statements of the future plans  objectives  and expected performance of the company  are forward looking statements that are dependent on certain events  risks and uncertainties that may be outside the company s control which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
some of these include  but are not limited to  economic and competitive conditions  inflation rates  legislative and regulatory changes  financial market conditions  political and economic uncertainties  future business decisions  and other uncertainties  all of which are difficult to predict 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proven oil and gas reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures 
the total amount or timing of actual future production may vary significantly from reserves and production estimates 
the drilling of exploratory wells can involve significant risks including those related to timing  success rates and cost overruns 
lease and rig availability  complex geology and other factors can affect these risks 
future oil and gas prices also could affect results of operations and cash flows 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations was based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we have identified certain of these policies as being of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and which require the application of significant judgment by management 
we analyze our estimates  including those related to the accounting for oil and gas revenues  bad debts  oil and gas properties  marketable securities  income taxes  derivatives  contingencies and litigation  and base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies relate to the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s financial statements successful efforts method of accounting the company accounts for its natural gas and crude oil exploration and development activities utilizing the successful efforts method of accounting 
under this method  costs of productive exploratory wells  development dry holes and productive wells and undeveloped leases are capitalized 
gas and oil lease acquisition costs are also capitalized 
exploration costs  including personnel costs  certain geological and geophysical expenses and delay rentals for gas and oil leases  are charged to expense as incurred 
exploratory drilling costs are initially capitalized  but charged to expense if and when the well is determined not to have found reserves in commercial quantities 
the sale of a partial interest in a proved property is accounted for as a cost recovery and no gain or loss is recognized as long as this treatment does not significantly affect the unit of production amortization rate 
a gain or loss is recognized for all other sales of producing properties 
the application of the successful efforts method of accounting requires managerial judgment to determine the proper classification of wells designated as developmental or exploratory which will ultimately determine the proper accounting treatment of the costs incurred 
the results from a drilling operation can take considerable time to analyze and the determination that commercial reserves have been discovered requires both judgment and industry experience 
wells may be completed that are assumed to be productive and actually deliver gas and oil in quantities insufficient to be economic  which may result in the abandonment of the wells at a later date 
wells are drilled that have targeted geologic structures that are both developmental and exploratory in nature and an allocation of costs is required to properly account for the results 
the evaluation of gas and oil leasehold acquisition costs requires judgment to estimate the fair value of these costs with reference to drilling activity in a given area 
drilling activities in an area by other companies may also effectively condemn leasehold positions 
the successful efforts method of accounting can have a significant impact on the operational results reported when the company is entering a new exploratory area in hopes of finding a gas and oil field that will be the focus of future development drilling activity 
any initial exploratory wells that are unsuccessful are expensed 
seismic costs can be substantial which will result in additional exploration expenses when incurred 
reserve estimates the company s estimates of gas  oil and natural gas liquids reserves  by necessity  are projections based on geologic and engineering data  and there are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of such data as well as the projection of future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of gas and oil and the recovery factor for each accumulation  both of which are difficult to measure 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
estimates of economically recoverable gas  oil and natural gas liquids reserves and future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  such as historical production from the area  the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies and assumptions governing future gas  oil and natural gas liquids prices  future operating costs  severance taxes  development costs and workover costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
the future drilling costs associated with reserves assigned to proved undeveloped locations may ultimately increase to an extent that these reserves may be later determined to be uneconomic 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of gas  oil and natural gas liquids attributable to any particular group of properties  classifications of such reserves based on risk of recovery  and estimates of the future net cash flows expected therefrom may vary substantially 
any significant variance in the assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of the reserves  which could affect the carrying value of the company s gas and oil properties and or the rate of depletion of the gas and oil properties 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to the company s reserves will likely vary from estimates  and such variances may be material 
impairment of gas and oil properties the company reviews its gas and oil properties for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate a decline in the recoverability of their carrying value 
the company estimates the expected undiscounted future cash flows of its gas and oil properties and compares such future cash flows to the carrying amount of the gas and oil properties to determine if the carrying amount is recoverable 
if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows  the company will adjust the carrying amount of the gas and oil properties to their fair value 
the factors used to determine fair value include estimates of proved reserves  future commodity pricing  future production estimates  anticipated capital expenditures  and a discount rate commensurate with the risk associated with realizing the expected cash flows projected 
there were no impairments of producing gas and oil properties in  or given the complexities associated with gas and oil reserve estimates and the history of price volatility in the gas and oil markets  events may arise that would require the company to record an impairment of the recorded book values associated with gas and oil properties 
in  the company recognized an impairment of million primarily as a result of the low market prices in effect at that time and there can be no assurance that impairments will not be required in the future 
derivative instruments and hedging activities the company periodically hedges a portion of its gas and oil production through swap and collar agreements 
the purpose of the hedges is to provide a measure of stability to our cash flows in an environment of volatile gas and oil prices and to manage the exposure to commodity price risk 
we recognize all derivative instruments as assets or liabilities in the balance sheet at fair value 
for cash flow hedges  changes in fair value  to the extent the hedge is effective  are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
for derivative instruments that do not qualify as hedges  changes in fair value are recognized in earnings currently 
the estimation of fair values for our hedging derivatives requires substantial judgment 
the fair values of our derivatives are estimated on a monthly basis using an option pricing model 
the option pricing model uses various factors that include closing exchange prices on the nymex  over the counter quotations  volatility and the time value of options 
these pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to market volatility as well as changes in future price forecasts  regional price differentials and interest rates 
results of operations the following analysis of operations for the years ended december   and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and associated footnotes included in this k 
excluding the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles  the company realized net income for the year ended december  of million or 
per share diluted basis as compared to net income of million or per share diluted basis for the same period in the majority of this decrease was attributable to lower commodity prices in the company realized net income of million or per share diluted basis in the year ended december  the majority of the company s production is natural gas and these general earnings trends were impacted significantly by the natural gas prices in effect each of these periods 
the average realized natural gas price for  and was per mcf  per mcf and per mcf  respectively 
the net loss and net income recognized in the years ended december  and were both impacted by the adoption of new accounting principles during these periods 
on january   the company adopted the new accounting standard  sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

in conjunction with the january stellarton energy acquisition  the company allocated million of the purchase price to goodwill 
the fair value test performed to evaluate the carrying value of this business segment and the recorded goodwill as required by sfas no 
resulted in the recognition of a non cash charge of million 
the year ended december  was similarly impacted by the adoption of sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities effective january  for which a million gain net of tax was recognized 
revenues during  revenues from gas  oil and natural gas liquids production decreased to million  as compared to million in this decrease was the result of i a decrease in average gas prices realized by the company from per mcf in to per mcf in  which decreased revenues million  ii a decrease in average oil and natural gas liquids prices received from to which decreased revenues million partially offset by  iii an increase in gas sales volumes of to bcf which increased revenues by million  and iv an increase in oil and natural gas liquids sales volumes of to million barrels  which increased revenues by million 
revenues in were not materially impacted by hedging activities 
during  revenues from gas  oil and natural gas liquids production increased to million  as compared to million in this increase was the result of i an increase in average gas prices received by the company from per mcf in to per mcf in  which increased revenues million  ii a decrease in average oil and natural gas liquids prices received from to which decreased revenues million  iii an increase in gas sales volumes of to bcf which increased revenues by million  and iv an increase in oil and natural gas liquids sales volumes of to million barrels  which increased revenues by million 
revenues in were also impacted by cash gains realized from hedging activities 
the nymex collar and swap transactions considered effective hedges and settled in  resulted in realized gains of million  which were included in gas and oil sales 
there was no material hedging activity in the revenues contributed by the stellarton transaction for the period subsequent to the closing date of january  were million in and million in the following table reflects the company s revenues  average prices received for gas and oil  and amount of gas and oil production in each of the years shown years ended december  in thousands revenues natural gas sales    crude oil sales    natural gas liquids    gathering and processing    marketing and trading  net    drilling    cash paid received on derivatives   change in derivative fair value  gain on sale of property   interest income and other   total revenues    years ended december  natural gas production mmcf    crude oil production mbbls natural gas liquid production mbbls    average natural gas sales price mcf average crude oil sales price bbl average natural gas liquid sales price bbl gathering and processing revenues decreased to million in compared to million in a number of non strategic gathering and processing assets were sold throughout resulting in the decrease in gathering and processing revenue in in  gathering and processing revenue increased to million  as compared to million in this increase was attributable to the distribution of certain gathering and processing assets to the company from wildhorse energy partners  llc wildhorse in november incremental revenues were recognized in as a result of the ownership of these gathering and processing assets which previously were owned by the company through the wildhorse partnership 
net marketing and trading income increased to million in from a net margin of million in and million in income increased in due to the company transporting gas into the mid continent region to take advantage of higher gas prices in this market 
net marketing and trading income has increased principally as a result of this marketing opportunity that utilized the company s firm transportation 
although this marketing differential increased marketing and trading income  the company had previously entered into certain financial instruments to lock the basis differential for the june through october contract periods in the mid continent market 
as these financial instruments were considered trading derivatives under sfas no 
 the cash settlements of million in were recognized as derivative losses during the year ended december  the cash profits realized on the physical sales included in marketing and trading income were partially offset by the million cash settlement on the trading derivatives 
however  the net impact of these transactions for was that the company was successful in realizing an additional 
mmbtu margin after transportation costs on gas moved into the mid continent region 
the marketing and trading margins in benefited from certain term and spot marketing arrangements at more favorable terms than were available in the market 
drilling revenue associated with the company s wholly owned subsidiary  sauer  remained relatively unchanged in at million 
in sauer generated a higher percentage of its contract drilling revenue from third party contracts not affiliated with tom brown 
contract drilling revenues associated with wells operated by the company and drilled by sauer are eliminated in consolidation 
this change in mix for resulted in essentially equivalent drilling revenues for and despite a decrease in the rig utilization rates from over in to approximately in drilling revenue increased from million in to million in due to higher rig utilization rates and increased day rates resulting from the general increase in activity within the oil and gas industry in as compared to costs and expenses expenses related to gas and oil production remained flat from to on an mcfe basis  gas and oil production costs decreased to

in taxes on gas and oil production decreased by or million in primarily due to a or million decrease in revenue from gas  oil and natural gas liquids from due to lower natural gas and natural gas liquids commodity prices 
taxes on gas and oil production decreased by or million in despite a or million increase in revenue from gas  oil and natural gas liquids for this resulted from the inclusion of million of canadian revenues in the results which are not subject to severance and other taxes typically incurred in the united states 
additionally  million realized on the natural gas hedge transactions was included in gas and oil sales in which is not subject to production related taxes 
the company also obtained a refund in of a portion of the production taxes paid in prior years which reduced the expenses reported 
depreciation  depletion and amortization increased million in as compared to the production increase of on a mcfe basis for contributed million to the increased depreciation  depletion and amortization 
the company s per unit depletion rate also increased in as a result of higher finding costs on the gas and oil reserve additions associated with the and capital programs 
in  depreciation  depletion and amortization expense on the producing gas and oil properties was 
per mcfe as compared to 
per mcfe in depreciation  depletion and amortization increased million in as compared to approximately million of this increase was associated with the depletion recorded on the stellarton assets acquired in january the production increase of on a mcfe basis on the domestic properties for also increased depreciation  depletion and amortization 
gathering and processing costs principally represent costs associated with operating and maintaining the field systems 
the million decrease in gathering and processing costs for was caused by the company s disposition of a number of the gathering and processing assets in which were considered non strategic to the company s operations 
expenses associated with the company s exploration activities were million  million and million for the years  and  respectively 
exploration expense for these periods was impacted by the dry hole costs of million  million and million recognized in  and  respectively 
the company also incurred additional seismic costs in which were primarily associated with the james lime and deep valley projects in texas that contributed to the increased exploration expense incurred in that period 
capital expenditures of million were incurred in compared to million in  which included million associated with the stellarton acquisition 
the exploration  development and land related expenditures were million  a decrease of in comparison to in  the exploration  development and land related expenditures were million 
the company s capital program budgets are influenced by the gas and oil prices received for its production 
the exploration expenses recognized by the company are influenced by the magnitude of the capital expenditures incurred in each year 
capital programs are risk adjusted to balance exploration and development opportunities 
recurring general and administrative expenses have increased from year to year as a result of the company s increased level of operations 
on an mcfe basis  general and administrative expenses were   and 
for the years  and  respectively 
included in the expenses for was a million 
per mcfe pre tax charge recorded in the first quarter of associated with the retirement of donald l 
evans  previously tom brown  inc s chairman and ceo 
mr 
evans received a million retirement payment and the company recognized a million non cash charge in conjunction with the acceleration of mr 
evans stock options 
general and administrative expenses related to the new canadian operations contributed million 
per mcfe to the increase in and million 
per mcfe for expenses also increased due to the addition of personnel necessary to implement the increased capital expenditure programs in and bad debt expense increased in as a result of a default by a previous purchaser of the company s natural gas liquids in the paradox basin of colorado and utah on payments owed the company totaling million 
an allowance for this entire receivable was recorded in the third quarter of given the uncertainty of collection at that time 
the company continued to aggressively pursue recovery of the amount owed and in the fourth quarter of  a million settlement was received in cash 
the collection of this settlement was treated as an adjustment to the allowance originally recorded 
as of december   the company does not anticipate that any future settlements will be received that will materially reduce the loss recognized as a result of this purchaser s default 
interest and other expense in was impacted by standby fees incurred under the terms of a two year commitment for a drilling rig utilized by the company at the deep valley project in west texas 
this rig became available in and million of standby fees were charged to expense when the rig was not being utilized 
interest expense also increased in and after the stellarton acquisition in january for which million in debt was incurred 
the company s effective interest rate under its credit facility was at december  and at december  the company recorded income tax provisions of million  million and million in   and  respectively  resulting in effective tax rates of  and  respectively 
the income tax provision of million was impacted by a million tax reduction associated with certain canadian expenses deductible in the united states and by million in state tax credits associated with drilling incentives in colorado and utah 
there was no tax impact associated with the goodwill impairment recorded in conjunction with the change in accounting principle as goodwill is not considered a deductible expense for tax purposes 
at december   the company has a net operating loss carryforward available for us federal tax purposes of million and a net operating loss carryforward available to reduce future canadian federal income taxes of million million cdn 
additionally  statutory depletion carryforwards of approximately million and million of alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards are available in the us to offset future taxes 
based upon the operating results for and the present economic environment for the gas and oil industry  the company believes that it will generate sufficient taxable income to utilize these carryforwards 
capital resources and liquidity growth and acquisitions the company continues to pursue opportunities which will add value by economically increasing its reserve base and presence in significant natural gas areas  and further developing the company s ability to control and market the production of natural gas 
as the company continues to evaluate potential acquisitions and property development opportunities  it will benefit from its financing flexibility and the leverage potential of the company s overall capital structure 
capital and exploration expenditures the company s capital and exploration expenditures and sources of financing for the years ended december   and are as follows in millions capital and exploration expenditures acquisitions stellarton rocky mountain assets and other exploration costs development costs acreage gas gathering and processing sauer drilling company 
other financing sources common stock issued net long term bank debt debt assumed on stellarton transaction proceeds from sale of assets cash flow provided by operating activities other the company anticipates capital and exploration expenditures between to million in  approximately of which will be allocated to exploration and development activity 
the timing of most of the company s capital expenditures is discretionary and there are no material long term commitments associated with the company s capital expenditure plans 
consequently  the company is able to adjust the level of its capital expenditures as circumstances warrant 
the level of capital expenditures by the company will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors 
historically  the company has funded capital expenditures and working capital requirements with both internally generated cash  borrowings and stock transactions 
property sales in april  the company sold its interest in oil and gas properties located in the powder river basin of wyoming for net cash proceeds of million 
these properties had a net book value of million which resulted in a million gain on the sale 
in april  the company also sold certain oil and gas properties located primarily in louisiana for million 
in november  the company sold certain oil and gas properties located in colorado for million 
as these sales represented partial interests in these proved properties  the proceeds were recorded as a reduction to the recorded cost of the oil and gas properties 
in  million in cash proceeds were derived from property sales 
in may  the company sold its interest in gas and oil properties located in oklahoma 
these properties had a net book basis of million 
this transaction resulted in a gain of l million with net cash proceeds of million 
cash proceeds of million were also realized in conjunction with several sales transactions in associated with the disposition of gathering and processing facilities received in the wildhorse distribution in november as the systems sold were non strategic to the company s operations and these divestitures were anticipated as part of the wildhorse integration process  the proceeds derived on these transactions were recorded as a reduction to the investment in the gathering assets 
debt contractual obligations in addition to the bank credit facility discussed in the following note  the company had various other contractual obligations as of december  the company has no off balance sheet debt or other such unrecorded obligations and the company has not guaranteed the debt of any other party 
the following table lists the company s significant liabilities at december  including the credit facility payments due by period contractual obligations less than year years years after years total in thousands bank credit facility    operating leases   transportation commitments     processing commitment      drilling rig obligation    total contractual cash obligations    the company leases its corporate office in denver  colorado under the terms of an operating lease  which expires in january yearly payments under the lease are approximately  net of sublease income 
the company s offices in midland  texas represents a commitment of  per year through december and the office lease in calgary  alberta expires in august at a rate of  per year 
the remaining operating lease commitments represent equipment leases  which expire during through the company has entered into various firm transportation commitments for approximately mmcf of gross gas sales per day as of december  the majority of these contracts expire in through subsequent to december   the company entered into additional firm transportation commitments on approximately mmcf of gross gas sales per day under varying terms that expire in and these commitments totaled million and are not included in the above schedule 
on december   the company had entered into an agreement with a third party to process its gas production from the white river dome coal bed methane project in the piceance basin 
under the terms of this agreement  the company is obligated to pay the third party  per month over the ten year term to cover the fixed operating costs of the plant and provide for a recovery of the plant investment to the third party 
the company is also obligated to reimburse the third party for certain variable expenses associated with the volumes processed through the plant and for compression made available to the company 
under certain circumstances  the company has the right but not the obligation to purchase the processing facility from the third party during the term of this agreement 
to assure the availability of a drilling rig in conjunction with an exploration program in west texas  the company entered into a two year commitment with a drilling contractor in the rig became available in and the two year drilling obligation commenced on may  under the terms of this arrangement  the company is required to pay a day rate of  per day during drilling operations and  per day for rig moves 
bank credit facility on june   the company entered into a million credit facility the credit facility that was to mature in june under the terms of the credit facility  the borrowing base was established at million 
on march   as part of the final financing of the stellarton acquisition  the company repaid and cancelled its previous million credit facility and entered into a new million credit facility the global credit facility 
the global credit facility is comprised of a million line of credit in the us and a million line of credit in canada which both mature in march  and a million five year term loan in canada 
the borrowing base under the global credit facility was set at million 
the global credit facility allows the lenders one scheduled redetermination of the borrowing base each december 
in addition  the lenders may elect to require one unscheduled redetermination in the event the borrowing base utilization exceeds of the borrowing base at any time for a period of consecutive business days 
at december   the company had borrowings outstanding under the global credit facility totaling million or of the borrowing base at an average interest rate of the amount available for borrowing under the global credit facility at december  was million 
borrowings under the global credit facility are unsecured and bear interest  at the election of the company  at a rate equal to i the greater of the global administrative agents prime rate or the federal funds effective rate plus an applicable margin  ii adjusted libor for eurodollar loans plus applicable margin  or iii bankers acceptances plus applicable margin for canadian dollar loans 
interest on amounts outstanding under the global credit facility is due on the last day of each quarter for prime based loans  and in the case of eurodollar loans with an interest period of more than three months  interest is due at the end of each three month interval 
the global credit facility contains certain financial covenants that require the company to maintain a minimum consolidated tangible net worth of not less than million adjusted upward by of quarterly net income subsequent to march  and of the net cash proceeds of any stock offering 
the company must also maintain a ratio of indebtedness to earnings before interest expense  state and federal taxes and depreciation  depletion and amortization expense and exploration expense of not more than to as calculated at the end of each fiscal quarter 
the company was in compliance with all covenants during and at december  markets and prices the company s revenues and associated cash flows are significantly impacted by changes in gas and oil prices 
all of the company s gas and oil production is currently market sensitive as none of the company s gas and oil production has been presold at contractually specified prices 
during  the average prices received for gas and oil by the company were per mcf and per barrel  respectively  as compared to mcf and per barrel in and per mcf and per barrel in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk commodity price fluctutations the company s results of operations are highly dependent upon the prices received for oil and natural gas production 
accordingly  in order to increase the financial flexibility and to protect the company against commodity price fluctuations  the company may  from time to time in the ordinary course of business  enter into hedging arrangements  including commodity swap agreements  forward sale contracts  commodity futures  options and other similar agreements relating to natural gas and crude oil expected to be produced 
the company has also entered into certain financial instruments that did not qualify as hedging arrangements 
these transactions have principally involved basis contracts entered into to secure a pricing differential into markets where the company has transportation agreements 
financial instruments designated as hedges are accounted for on the accrual basis with gains and losses being recognized based on the type of contract and exposure being hedged 
gains and losses on natural gas and crude oil swaps designated as hedges of anticipated transactions  including gains or losses recognized upon early termination of contracts  are deferred and recognized in income when the associated hedged commodities are produced 
in order for natural gas and crude oil swaps or collars to qualify as a hedge of an anticipated transaction  the derivative contract must identify the expected date of the transaction  the commodity involved  and the expected quantity to be purchased or sold among other requirements 
in the event that it becomes probable that a hedged transaction will not occur  gains and losses  including gains or losses upon early termination of contracts  are included in the income statement 
the company has natural gas hedges  in the form of costless collars and swaps including related basis swaps  as follows as of december  natural gas collars natural gas swaps period mmbtu d weighted average floor ceiling mmbtu d weighted average swap price first quarter second quarter   third quarter   fourth quarter   the company also entered into certain financial instruments to lock the basis differential on  mmbtu day of firm transportation volumes during the june through october contract periods of these contracts effectively fixed a price differential into the mid continent market at a weighted average price of above the price index for a delivery point in the rocky mountain area where the company markets a significant portion of its natural gas production 
under sfas  these basis swaps did not qualify for hedge accounting 
accordingly  these basis swaps resulted in the recognition of derivative losses of million in which were recorded directly to earnings 
interest rate risk at december   the company had million outstanding under the global credit facility at an average interest rate of 
borrowings under the global credit facility bear interest  at the election of the company  at i the greater of the agent bank s prime rate or the federal funds effective rate  plus an applicable margin or ii the agent bank s eurodollar rate  plus an applicable margin 
as a result  the company s annual interest cost in will fluctuate based on short term interest rates 
assuming no change in the amount outstanding during  the impact on interest expense of a ten percent change in the average interest rate would be approximately 
million 
as the interest rate is variable and is reflective of current market conditions  the carrying value of the global credit facility approximates the fair value 
foreign currency exchange risk the company conducts business in canada where the canadian dollar has been designated as the functional currency 
this subjects the company to foreign currency exchange risk on cash flows related to sales  expenses  financing and investing transactions 
the company has not entered into any foreign currency forward contracts or other similar financial instruments to manage this risk
