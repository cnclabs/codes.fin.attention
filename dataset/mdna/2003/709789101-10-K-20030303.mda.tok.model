this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and footnotes  as well as the ratios and statistics  contained elsewhere in this form k 
references will be found in this form k to the following transactions that have impacted or will impact peoples results of operations o as discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  peoples has signed a definitive agreement and plan of merger with kentucky bancshares incorporated kentucky bancshares  the holding company of kentucky bank trust  providing for the acquisition of kentucky bancshares by peoples 
in addition  peoples completed the acquisition of a banking center in malta  ohio  on october   and first colony bancshares  inc first colony  the holding company of the guernsey bank  fsb  a federal savings bank based in cambridge  ohio  on june  o on december   peoples completed the sale of  common shares through a firm commitment underwritten offering the common stock offering 
on january   peoples sold an additional  common shares in conjunction with the option granted to the underwriters to cover over allotments 
the common stock offering and the additional common shares sold to cover over allotments generated new capital totaling million after offering expenses 
in early  peoples used million of the net proceeds to increase peoples bank s capital position 
peoples intends to use the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes  which may include the repayment of outstanding indebtedness  mergers  acquisitions and other strategic investments 
o on april   peoples issued million of libor based floating rate trust preferred securities through pebo capital trust ii a newly formed subsidiary  which participated in a pooled offering 
pebo capital trust ii used the proceeds from the issuance to purchase floating rate junior subordinated debit securities due april  the debentures 
peoples has used the net proceeds from the sale of the debentures for general corporate purposes and management of corporate liquidity 
the impact of these transactions  where significant  is discussed in the applicable sections of this management s discussion and analysis 
critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of peoples conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap and to general practices within the banking industry 
the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
a summary of peoples significant accounting policies can be found in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
management has identified the accounting policies described below as those that  due to the judgments  estimates and assumptions inherent in those policies  are critical to an understanding of peoples consolidated financial statements and management s discussion and analysis 
income recognition peoples recognizes interest income by methods that conform to general accounting practices within the banking industry 
in the event management believes collection of all or a portion of contractual interest on a loan has become doubtful  which generally occurs after the loan is days past due  peoples discontinues the accrual of interest and any previously accrued interest recognized in income deemed uncollectible is reversed if accrued in the current year or charged against the allowance for loan losses if accrued in the prior year 
interest received on nonaccrual loans is included in income only if principal recovery is reasonably assured 
a nonaccrual loan is restored to accrual status when it is brought current  has performed in accordance with contractual terms for a reasonable period of time  and the collectibility of the total contractual principal and interest is no longer in doubt 
allowance for loan losses in general  determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses requires significant judgment and the use of estimates by management 
peoples maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb probable losses in the loan portfolio based on a quarterly analysis of the portfolio and expected future losses 
this formal analysis determines an appropriate level and allocation of the allowance for loan losses among loan types by considering factors affecting loan losses  including specific losses  levels and trends in impaired and nonperforming loans  historical loan loss experience  current national and local economic conditions  volume  growth and composition of the portfolio  regulatory guidance and other relevant factors 
management continually monitors the loan portfolio through its loan review department and loan loss committee to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance 
ultimately  peoples records a provision for loan losses to maintain the allowance at an adequate level 
the provision expense could increase or decrease each quarter based upon the results of management s formal analysis 
the amount of the allowance for the various loan types represents management s estimate of expected losses from existing loans based upon specific allocations for individual lending relationships and historical loss experience for each category of homogeneous loans 
the allowance for loan losses related to impaired loans is based on discounted cash flows using the loan s initial effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral for certain collateral dependent loans 
this evaluation requires management to make estimates of the amounts and timing of future cash flows on impaired loans  which consists primarily of non accrual and restructured loans 
individual loan reviews are based upon specific quantitative and qualitative criteria  including the size of the loan  loan quality ratings  value of collateral  repayment ability of borrowers  and historical experience factors 
the historical experience factors utilized are based upon past loss experience  trends in losses and delinquencies  the growth of loans in particular markets and industries  and known changes in economic conditions in the particular lending markets 
allowances for homogeneous loans such as residential mortgage loans  credit cards  personal loans  etc 
are collectively evaluated based upon historical loss experience  trends in losses and delinquencies  growth of loans in particular markets  and known changes in economic conditions in each particular lending market 
consistent with the evaluation of allowances for homogenous loans  allowances relating to the overdraft privilege program are based upon management s monthly analysis of accounts in the program 
this analysis considers factors that could affect future losses on existing accounts  including historical loss experience and length of overdraft 
there can be no assurance that the allowance for loan losses will be adequate to cover all losses  but management believes the allowance for loan losses was adequate at december  while management uses available information to provide for loan losses  the ultimate collectibility of a substantial portion of the loan portfolio and the need for future additions to the allowance will be based on changes in economic conditions and other relevant factors 
a slowdown in economic activity could adversely affect cash flows for both commercial and individual borrowers  as a result of which peoples could experience increases in problem assets  delinquencies and losses on loans 
investment securities investment securities are recorded at cost  which includes premiums and discounts if purchased at other than par or face value 
peoples amortizes premiums and discounts as an adjustment to interest income using the effective interest method over the estimated life of the security 
the cost of investment securities sold  and any resulting gain or loss  is based on the specific identification method 
management determines the appropriate classification of investment securities at the time of purchase 
held to maturity securities are those securities that peoples has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity and are recorded at amortized cost 
available for sale securities are those securities that would be available to be sold in the future in response to peoples liquidity needs  changes in market interest rates  and asset liability management strategies  among others 
available for sale securities are reported at fair value  with unrealized holding gains and losses reported in stockholders equity as a separate component of other comprehensive income  net of applicable deferred income taxes 
peoples classifies its entire investment portfolio as available for sale 
as a result  both the investment and equity sections of peoples balance sheet are more sensitive to changes in the overall market value of the investment portfolio  in response to changes in market interest rates  investor confidence and other factors affecting marketing values  than if the investment portfolio was classified as held to maturity 
management systematically evaluates investment securities for other than temporary declines in fair value on a quarterly basis 
declines in fair value of individual investment securities below their amortized cost that are deemed to be other than temporary will be written down to current market value and included in earnings as realized losses 
there were no investment securities which management identified to be other than temporarily impaired for the year ended december  if the financial markets experience deterioration and investments decline in fair value  charges to income could occur in future periods 
goodwill and other intangible assets statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  establishes standards for the amortization of acquired intangible assets and the non amortization and impairment assessment of goodwill 
in addition  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 acquisitions of certain financial institutions sfas  establishes standards for unidentifiable intangible assets acquired specifically in branch purchases that qualify as business combinations 
at december   peoples had million of core deposit intangible assets  which is subject to amortization  and million in goodwill  which is not subject to periodic amortization 
goodwill arising from business combinations represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements in the business acquired 
peoples goodwill relates to value inherent in the banking business and the value is dependent upon peoples ability to provide quality  cost effective services in a competitive market place 
as such  goodwill value is supported ultimately by revenue that is driven by the volume of business transacted 
a decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth or the inability to deliver cost effective services over sustained periods can lead to impairment of goodwill that could adversely impact earnings in future periods 
under us gaap in effect through december   peoples amortized goodwill on a straight line basis over periods ranging from ten to fifteen years 
effective january   peoples was no longer required to amortize previously recorded goodwill as a result of adopting sfas and sfas peoples has performed the transitional impairment tests on its goodwill assets and has concluded the recorded value of goodwill was not impaired as of december  there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of impairment 
another estimate using different  but still reasonable  assumptions could produce a significantly different result 
additionally  future events could cause management to conclude impairment indicators exist and peoples goodwill is impaired  which would result in peoples recording an impairment loss 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on peoples financial condition and results of operations 
overview of the income statement peoples net income totaled  in  up  or compared to  last year 
diluted earnings per share improved to in from for the prior year  an increase of or 
in  peoples earnings increased as a result of strong net interest income and enhanced non interest income  which increased  and  respectively 
return on average equity was in versus in while return on average assets was and for the same periods  respectively 
reported net income for the year ended december   reflects the adoption of sfas  on january   and sfas  which is effective retroactive to january   whereby goodwill is no longer amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests 
earnings per diluted share would have been in excluding goodwill amortization of  that would not have been recorded had sfas and been in effect 
on a comparative basis without goodwill amortization  net income per diluted share increased in compared to net income was also positively impacted by peoples purchase of million of trust preferred securities issued by pebo capital trust i  at a discount in the first quarter  which resulted in an extraordinary gain of  or  after tax and reduced trust preferred expense by  compared to excluding the extraordinary gain  income grew from last year  to  or per diluted share in net interest income grew in  totaling  compared to  in  largely the result of very low market interest rates during the year 
non interest income was  in versus  a year ago  a increase 
enhanced non interest income in is primarily the result of higher levels of deposit service charge income  while non interest income in the fourth quarter of was enhanced by non recurring income of  relating to a demutualization 
for the year ended december   non interest expense totaled  compared to  in  as increased operating expenses were partially offset by reduced intangible amortization expense due to new accounting rules that resulted in peoples ceasing amortization of all goodwill 
interest income and expense peoples derives a majority of its interest income from loans and investment securities and incurs interest expense on interest bearing deposits and borrowed funds 
net interest income  the amount by which interest income exceeds interest expense  remains peoples largest source of revenue 
management periodically adjusts the mix of assets and liabilities in an attempt to manage and improve net interest income  however  factors that influence market interest rates  such as interest rate changes by the federal reserve open market committee and peoples competitors  may have a greater impact on net interest income than those adjustments made by management 
consequently  a volatile rate environment can make it extremely difficult to manage net interest margin and income  let alone predict future changes 
in  net interest income totaled  compared to  in  an increase of  or 
total interest income was down  or in to  from  a year ago 
interest expense decreased  or  totaling  versus s  the low interest rate environment in afforded management opportunities to lower peoples costs of funds more than the declines experienced in asset yields  while a modest growth in earning assets  due in part to first colony acquisition  provided additional improvement in net interest income 
included in interest income is tax exempt income derived from loans to and investments issued by states and political subdivisions 
since these revenues are not taxed  management believes it is more meaningful to analyze net interest income on a fully tax equivalent fte basis  which adjusts interest income by converting tax exempt income to the pre tax equivalent of taxable income using a tax rate of 
in  interest income was increased by  for the impact of the tax equivalent adjustment  resulting in fte net interest income of  up  or from  in the fte yield on peoples earning assets was for the year ended december   versus for the same period last year  while the cost of interest bearing liabilities was and for the same periods  respectively 
net interest margin calculated by dividing fte net interest income by average interest earning assets serves as an important measurement of the net revenue stream generated by the mix and pricing of peoples earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
in  net interest margin was versus a year ago 
while market interest rates remained at very low levels throughout  management s focus on securing longer term funding to lock in low rates  coupled with continued demand for lower loan rates  compressed net interest margin in the second half of in the fourth quarter of  net interest margin was compared to in the prior quarter and in the fourth quarter of net interest margin in the fourth quarter of was also adversely impacted by additional net premium amortization of approximately  on mortgage backed securities due to increased prepayment speeds  an interest reversal of approximately  due to an incorrect accrual on a business loan  and net premium amortization of approximately  on loans acquired in the first colony acquisition 
earning assets averaged billion in  up million or compared to billion last year 
loans accounted for the largest portion of earning assets  averaging million for the year ended december   compared to average loans of million in loans acquired in the first colony acquisition accounted for a majority of the loan growth from a year ago 
investment securities averaged million in compared to million a year ago  as management grew the investment portfolio during as part of a plan initiated in late to return the portfolio  as a percent of earning assets  to pre levels in anticipation of modest loan growth in the fte yield on loans was in compared to the prior year  while the fte yield on investments was and for the same periods  respectively 
declining yields on both loans and investment securities are a result of lower market interest rates 
peoples average interest bearing liabilities increased million or to billion for the year ended december   from million a year ago 
traditional deposits comprise the majority of peoples interest bearing liabilities  averaging million in compared to million in  an increase of million or due in large part to deposits acquired as part of acquisitions 
cost of funds from interest bearing deposits was in  down from in the lower rates paid on interest bearing deposit accounts were a result of market rates remaining at low levels  however  management competitively priced peoples longer term certificates of deposit as part of a strategy to shift to longer term funding  which tempered the overall drop in average deposit costs 
while traditional deposits remain the primary source of funds  peoples routinely utilizes a variety of borrowings as complementary funding sources 
total borrowed funds averaged million for the year ended december   up million or from million a year ago 
while additional advances from the federal home loan bank fhlb comprise the majority of this increase  a portion of this increase is also attributable to peoples obtaining a million loan from an unrelated financial institution to initially fund the first colony acquisition 
the interest cost of peoples borrowed funds was in  down from last year 
peoples main sources of borrowed funds are short and long term advances from the fhlb 
short term fhlb advances are primarily variable rate  libor based advances that are used to balance peoples daily liquidity needs and may be repaid at any time without a penalty 
the long term fhlb advances consist largely of year borrowings requiring monthly interest payments and principal is due at maturity 
the rate on these advances are fixed for initial periods ranging from two to four years  depending on the specific advance 
after the initial fixed rate period  the fhlb has the option to convert each advance to a libor based  variable rate advance  however  peoples may repay the advance  without a penalty  if the fhlb exercises its option 
in  peoples short term fhlb borrowings averaged million compared to million a year ago and the average cost was and for the same periods  respectively 
average long term fhlb borrowings were up million or compared to  totaling million for the year ended december   while the average cost dropped to from 
the increase in long term fhlb advances was due to management s efforts to secure longer term funding during this period of low rates 
a portion of the new long term fhlb advances are fixed rate advances that require monthly principal and interest payments and may not be repaid prior to maturity without a penalty 
management intends to continue using a variety of fhlb borrowings to fund asset growth and manage interest rate sensitivity  as deemed appropriate 
peoples offers cash management services to its business customers  which also provide short term funding in the form of overnight repurchase agreements 
in  overnight repurchase agreements excluding balances of wholesale market term repurchase agreements averaged million  down from million last year 
the average rate paid on overnight repurchase agreements was in compared to in the prior year  a result of reductions in the market index tied to the pricing of these accounts 
peoples also periodically accesses national market repurchase agreements to diversify short term funding sources 
in  wholesale market term repurchase agreements averaged million at a rate of  down from million and average rate of in peoples reduced the amount of wholesale repurchase agreements outstanding due to the availability and attractiveness of other funding sources 
management may access such funding at other times in the future  as deemed appropriate 
in late  management initiated an asset growth strategy to offset the dilutive impact of the common stock offering  thereby leveraging peoples increased capital levels leverage strategy 
this leverage strategy caused earning assets  particularly mortgage backed investment securities  to increase by approximately million in january compared to year end peoples funded the investment purchases using million of wholesale market repurchase agreements  million of fhlb advances and million from the common stock offering 
in addition to the positive impact to net interest income  the leverage strategy has enhanced peoples asset sensitivity 
as the new securities pay down through monthly principal and interest payments  management would expect to reinvest the runoff over time into higher earning assets  such as loans 
net interest income and margin improved as a result of the low interest rate environment and peoples proactive management of funding costs  as well as a modest increase in earning assets 
these factors allowed management to reduce peoples funding costs more than the decline in earning asset yields 
at december   peoples asset liability simulations indicated that a sustained increase in interest rates could cause net interest income to increase modestly based on peoples interest rate risk position at that time 
in  management expects net interest margin to compress as a result of the leverage strategy in addition to peoples ongoing shift to longer term funding and the demand for lower rates on loans 
even though management continues to focus on minimizing the impact of future rate changes on peoples earnings  peoples net interest margin and income remain difficult to predict  and to manage  since changes in market interest rates can have a greater impact than adjustments by management 
provision for loan losses in  peoples provision for loan losses was  compared to  in the majority of this increase was due to provisions related to the first full year s impact of the overdraft privilege program  which totaled  in compared to  in the remaining increases in the provision were based upon management s ongoing evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and factors affecting probable loan losses 
when expressed as a percentage of average loans  the provision has been  and in  and  respectively 
management believes the provisions were appropriate for the overall quality  inherent risk and volume concentrations of peoples loan portfolio 
gains and or losses on securities transactions peoples recognized net gains on securities transactions of  in compared to  in the net gains on securities transactions were primarily the result of normal portfolio activity  however  management s plan to balance the overall yield  maturity and duration of the investment portfolio contributed to the net gains in gains on sale of loans peoples recognized a gain on sale of loans of  in as a result of selling a limited number of fixed rate real estate loans into the secondary market 
in prior periods  peoples either has acted as an agent with a national firm for long term  fixed rate real estate loans or retained the loans and thus did not recognize any gains 
management anticipates originating and selling additional fixed rate mortgage loans into the secondary market in the future 
non interest income peoples generates non interest income from five primary sources deposit account service charges  fiduciary activities  investment and insurance commissions  electronic banking and business owned life insurance boli 
in  non interest income was  versus  a year ago  an increase of  or 
higher levels of deposit account service charge income was the primary driver of peoples enhanced non interest income in  while non recurring income of  relating to a demutualization positively impacted non interest income in in december  peoples introduced overdraft privilege  which has significantly impacted non interest revenues in overdraft privilege is a service that provides qualified clients with virtually automatic protection by establishing an overdraft privilege amount 
after a day waiting period to verify deposit ability  each new checking account receives an overdraft privilege amount of either or  based on the type of account and other parameters 
once established  clients are permitted to overdraw their accounts  up to their overdraft privilege limit  with each item being charged peoples regular overdraft fee 
clients then pay back the overdraft privilege with their next deposit 
while overdraft privilege has boosted revenues  peoples records a provision for losses from checking accounts with overdrafts deemed uncollectible  partially reducing the overall benefit 
the provision and any chargeoffs are included in peoples allowance for loan losses 
management believes this simple  efficient process allows peoples to fill the void between traditional overdraft protection  such as a line of credit  and check cashing stores 
concurrent with the introduction of overdraft privilege  peoples made several changes to the assessment of cost recovery fees on its deposit accounts  which further enhanced non interest revenues 
peoples changed the number of overdrafts for which a fee is charged from per day to an unlimited number  while also automating the overdraft decision process to minimize the opportunity to pay overdraft items without charging the fee 
another significant change was the modification of peoples core operating system to begin charging for point of sale pos and atm transactions that cause an overdraft  which previously were paid without the client incurring a fee 
while this change would have affected only a limited number of transactions  overdraft privilege now allows those transactions that would have previously been denied due to insufficient funds to be processed  resulting in a higher volume of overdrafts from pos and atm transactions 
service charges and other fees on deposit accounts  which are based on the recovery of costs associated with services provided  remain peoples largest source of non interest revenues 
in  deposit account service charges totaled  up  or from  a year ago 
this increase is the result of higher volumes of overdraft and non sufficient funds fees attributable to peoples introduction of the overdraft privilege program  as well as other changes to the assessment of these fees in late overdraft fees grew in when compared to last year  while non sufficient funds fees increased 
in the fourth quarter of  deposit account services charges were virtually flat compared to the prior quarter and management does not anticipate substantial growth in the deposit account service charges in peoples electronic banking services are alternative delivery channels to traditional sales offices for providing services to clients 
these services include atm and debit cards  direct deposit services and internet banking 
electronic banking revenues totaled  in  up  or from  in throughout  clients used peoples debit cards to complete more of their payment transactions  reaching a volume of nearly million in december and exceeding million for the year 
in addition  peoples issued over  new cards to clients in  with of these cards issued in conjunction with acquisitions 
management continues to explore new e banking capabilities that complement existing delivery channels  both traditional and non traditional  as sources of revenue and to expand product and service opportunities for peoples customers 
in  insurance and investment commissions grew  or to  from  the prior year 
while strong annuity sales in accounted for most of the increase  additional property and casualty insurance commissions also contributed to the growth 
the following table details peoples insurance and investment commissions dollars in thousands fixed annuities  property and casualty insurance brokerage life and health insurance credit life and a h insurance reinsurance revenues total    peoples fiduciary fees  which are based in part on the market value of assets managed  totaled  in compared to  in in  management combined peoples trust  brokerage and life insurance groups to create peoples financial advisors to improve its ability to provide asset and risk management products to peoples clients and prospects in a more integrated and client focused manner through newly formed service teams 
as a result of this initiative and management s ongoing focus  insurance and investment commissions  as well as fiduciary revenues  should continue to be significant contributors to future non interest income growth 
peoples boli investment enhances operating efficiency by offsetting rising employee benefit costs 
in  boli income totaled  versus  last year  an increase of  or 
the timing of peoples boli purchase in mid accounted for the majority of the increase  while an adjustment in the mix of investment funds in early provided additional enhancement 
non interest expense non interest expense totaled  in  up  or from  a year ago 
this increase was due largely to peoples incurring additional operating expenses in  primarily higher salaries and benefit expenses and professional fees 
however  peoples adoption of new accounting rules positively impacted non interest expense through the discontinuance of all goodwill amortization and tempering the increase in operating expenses 
salaries and benefits remain peoples largest non interest expense  which is inherent in a service based industry such as financial services 
in  salaries and benefits totaled  compared to  last year  an increase of  or 
this increase is largely attributable to the addition of new associates and salary increases necessary to retain and recruit key personnel 
at december   peoples had full time equivalent associates  up from at year end  with the first colony acquisition accounting for nearly half of this increase 
the remaining increase was attributable to the addition of associates in both sales and support positions in response to peoples expanded customer base 
salaries and benefits were also impacted by additional incentive plan expenses of  in that correspond with peoples improved earnings 
management will continue to leverage peoples resources  while retaining and recruiting key associates  to effectively optimize customer service and produce additional future revenue streams 
professional fees  which include fees for accounting  legal and other professional services  were up  or in compared to last year  totaling  versus  costs associated with peoples implementation of free checking and overdraft privilege  which totaled  comprised the majority of the increase  while various other strategic initiatives accounted for the remaining increase 
marketing expense totaled  in  up  or from  in as a result of various promotional campaigns throughout the year 
in the first half of  peoples aggressively advertised its new free checking and overdraft privilege products and implemented a new marketing campaign designed to enhance brand name awareness in peoples markets 
in the second half of  peoples promoted its enhanced internet billpay capabilities 
these initiatives have helped peoples attract many new clients  which improved top line revenues 
peoples experienced a modest increase in net occupancy and equipment expenses due to investments in technology and recent acquisitions 
in  net occupancy and equipment expenses totaled  compared to  a year ago  an increase of  or 
this continued investment in technology has enhanced peoples ability to serve clients and satisfy client needs  while acquisitions have allowed peoples to expand its customer base 
in  intangible amortization expense was down substantially from last year in response to the adoption of new accounting standards  which permitted peoples to discontinue the amortization of all goodwill effective january  as a result  peoples had no goodwill amortization in compared to  in however  peoples continued to amortize other intangible assets  primarily core deposit intangibles  which totaled  in  up  or as a result of acquisitions 
peoples trust preferred costs dropped in to  from  as a result of peoples million trust preferred purchase in the first quarter of while the issuance of trust preferred securities through pebo capital trust ii tempered the overall reduction in trust preferred costs  these variable rate  libor based securities should allow peoples trust preferred costs to remain below its previously fixed rate of  at least in the short term 
data processing and software costs were  in compared to  a year ago 
this increase is primarily due to software licensing renewal fees incurred in the first half of in  management anticipates making investments in new systems  such as customer relationship management and profitability systems  which will result in higher data processing and software costs compared to management uses the non interest income leverage ratio as a measurement of non interest expense leverage 
the ratio  defined as non interest income as a percentage of operating expenses  excludes gains and losses on securities transaction and asset disposals  as well as intangible asset amortization 
due to strong non interest revenues coupled with controlled expense growth  the non interest leverage ratio improved to in compared to a year ago 
peoples sales associates will strive to generate new revenues and leverage operating expenses through a needs based selling approach in order to achieve the long term target non interest income leverage ratio of 
return on equity peoples return on equity roe was in versus in this enhancement is largely attributable to peoples higher net income  while the increased gain in the mark to market adjustment on the available for sale investment portfolio negatively impacted roe 
since roe will continue to be impacted by changing market conditions  management focuses on earnings per share eps as a more meaningful measurement of short term performance 
return on assets return on assets roa was in  up from in  with the improvement in a result of peoples strong earnings 
in recent years  the primary focus of both the investment community and management has shifted to eps enhancement and roe while reducing the emphasis on roa as a key performance indicator 
however  management continues to monitor roa and considers it a measurement of peoples asset utilization 
income tax expense peoples effective tax rate was reduced to in compared to in peoples adoption of sfas and sfas accounted for of this decrease  while peoples investment in tax advantaged investments accounted for of the decline 
peoples has continued to make several tax advantaged investments  including investments in low income housing tax credit funds and the purchase of boli 
as a result  the amount of tax advantaged investments included in other assets averaged million in  nearly double last year s average 
depending on economic and regulatory conditions  peoples may make additional investments in various tax credit pools and other tax advantaged assets over the next several years which could impact peoples effective tax rate and overall tax burden 
overview of balance sheet at december   total assets were billion compared to billion at year end  an increase of million or 
gross loans grew million or during  to million at december   with approximately million attributable to acquisitions 
peoples planned growth of the investment portfolio in resulted in total investment securities of million at december   up million or from year end total liabilities were billion at december  compared to billion at year end  an increase of million or 
at december   deposits totaled million versus million at year end  with the majority of the increase attributable to acquisitions 
interest bearing balances grew million or while non interest bearing deposits were up million or since december  borrowed funds increased million or at december   totaling million  versus million at year end stockholders equity totaled million at december   versus million at december   an increase of million or 
the common stock offering generated capital of million  after offering expenses  accounting for the majority of this increase 
peoples increased earnings  net of dividends paid  was also a significant contributor to the higher level of equity at year end cash and cash equivalents peoples cash and cash equivalents are federal funds sold  cash and balances due from banks  and interest bearing balances in other institutions 
the amount of cash and cash equivalents fluctuates on a daily basis due to client activity and peoples liquidity needs 
at december   cash and cash equivalents totaled million  up million or compared to million at december  the majority of this increase is attributable to a higher level of federal funds sold due to the timing of the common stock offering in late  while the remaining increase was the result of additional items in process of collection 
at december   peoples had federal funds sold of million compared to million at year end management believes the current balance of cash and cash equivalents  along with the availability of other funding sources  should allow peoples to meet cash obligations  special needs and off balance sheet commitments  specifically undrawn lines of credit  construction loans and letters of credit  as they come due 
peoples will actively manage the principal runoff from the investment and loan portfolios and reinvest those funds based on loan demand and investment opportunities  as appropriate  while monitoring the level of cash and cash equivalents to ensure funds are appropriately deployed and maintaining adequate liquidity 
further information regarding peoples liquidity can be found later in this discussion under interest rate sensitivity and liquidity 
investment securities at december   the amortized cost of peoples investment securities totaled million compared to million at year end  while the market value of the investment portfolio was million at december   up from million at december  in the first half of  management continued the planned growth of the investment portfolio in anticipation of modest loan growth in in addition  peoples also acquired investment securities of approximately million  primarily mortgage backed securities  in conjunction with the first colony acquisition 
the difference in amortized cost and market value at december   resulted in unrealized appreciation in the investment portfolio of million and a corresponding increase in peoples equity of million  net of deferred taxes 
in comparison  the difference in amortized cost and market value at december   resulted in unrealized appreciation of million and an increase in equity of million  net of deferred taxes 
at december   peoples investment in us treasury securities and obligations of us government agencies and corporations was down million or versus year end  due primarily to the sale of a million callable security late in the first quarter of management reinvested the proceeds from this sale along with the principal runoff in the investment portfolio throughout in mortgage backed securities and obligations of states and political subdivisions  which accounts for the increase in those security types 
in  peoples will grow its investment in mortgage backed securities investment securities by approximately million as part of the leverage strategy discussed in the interest income and expense section of this discussion 
further information regarding peoples investment securities can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
management monitors the earnings performance and liquidity of the investment portfolio on a regular basis through asset liability committee alco meetings 
the alco also monitors net interest income  sets deposit pricing and maturity guidelines  and manages peoples interest rate risk 
through active management of the balance sheet and investment portfolio  peoples seeks to maintain sufficient liquidity to satisfy depositor demand  other company liquidity requirements and various credit needs of its customers 
loans peoples bank originates various types of loans  including commercial  financial and agricultural loans commercial loans  real estate loans both commercial and residential and consumer loans  focusing primarily on lending opportunities in central and southeastern ohio  northwestern west virginia  and northeastern kentucky markets 
at december   gross loans totaled million  an increase of million or since year end peoples acquired loans of approximately million as part of acquisitions 
in addition  peoples has experienced organic growth in commercial loans of million 
this commercial loan growth was partially offset by declines in real estate and consumer loan balances 
at december   commercial loan balances  including loans secured by commercial real estate  were million  up million or from year end s balance of million  with nearly million of the increase attributable to lending opportunities within peoples existing markets 
in addition to organic growth  peoples acquired loans of approximately million as part of acquisitions and approximately million through the purchase of multi family real estate loans from an unrelated financial institution in the first quarter of commercial loans continue to represent the largest portion of peoples total loan portfolio  comprising of total loans at december  and at december  the portion of commercial loan balances secured by commercial real estate  excluding construction loans  was million and million at december  and  respectively 
future commercial lending activities will be dependent on economic and related conditions  such as general demand for loans in peoples primary markets  interest rates offered by peoples and normal underwriting requirements 
in addition to in market opportunities  peoples will continue to selectively lend to creditworthy customers outside its primary markets 
real estate loans  which include construction loans but exclude loans secured by commercial real estate  totaled million at december  compared to million at year end  an increase of million or 
in  peoples acquired approximately million of real estate loans through acquisitions  which was partially offset by declines experienced in the portfolio throughout the year 
real estate loans comprised of peoples total loan portfolio at december   versus at the prior year end 
included in real estate loans are home equity credit line equiline balances of million at december   up from million at december  this increase was attributable to peoples acquiring home equity loans of approximately million in the first colony acquisition  however  peoples continues to experience intense competition for home equity loans  which has affected peoples ability to maintain existing equiline balances 
management believes equiline loans are a relationship product with an acceptable return on investment after risk considerations 
residential real estate loans continue to represent a major focus of peoples lending due to the lower risk factors associated with this type of loan  and the opportunity to provide additional products and services to these consumers  at reasonable risk return ratios to peoples 
excluding credit card balances  consumer loans have decreased million or since year end  totaling million at december  consumer loan balances have declined throughout as a result of both a decline in demand and peoples focusing on loan quality more than loan growth due to economic conditions 
this decline was partially offset by peoples acquiring consumer loans of approximately million through the first colony and malta acquisitions 
the indirect lending area represents the majority of peoples consumer loans  with balances of million and million at december  and respectively 
the decline in indirect loan balances since year end is due to automobile manufacturers offering attractive financing options to car buyers through their captive credit affiliates  declining indirect sales opportunities  and normal runoff of indirect loans 
management is satisfied with the performance of peoples consumer loan portfolio  which can be attributed to a commitment to sound lending practices and a strong customer service orientation 
lenders use a tiered pricing system that enables peoples to apply interest rates based on the corresponding risk associated with the loan 
although consumer debt delinquencies have increased in the financial services industry  management s actions to reinforce peoples pricing system and underwriting criteria in addition to proactive collection efforts have had a positive impact on consumer loan delinquencies 
management plans to continue its commitment to the use of this tiered pricing system to improve the performance of peoples consumer loan portfolio 
peoples credit card balances totaled million at december   down million or since december  while  management routinely evaluates new opportunities to serve credit card customers and grow the credit card balance  peoples credit cards are marketed as a complementary product offering for client relationships 
loan concentration peoples largest concentration of commercial loans are credits to assisted living facilities and nursing homes  which comprised of peoples outstanding commercial loans at december   versus at year end loans to lodging and lodging related companies also represented a significant portion of peoples commercial loans accounting for approximately of peoples outstanding commercial loans at quarter end  compared to at december  these lending opportunities have arisen due to the growth of these industries in markets served by peoples or contiguous areas  as well as sales associates efforts to develop these relationships 
management believes peoples loans to assisted living facilities and nursing homes  as well as loans to lodging and lodging related companies  do not pose abnormal risk when compared to risk assumed in other types of lending since these credits have been subjected to peoples normal underwriting standards 
in addition  a sizeable portion of the loans to lodging and lodging related companies are spread over various geographic areas  guaranteed by individuals with substantial net worth and or possess lower loan to collateral value ratios than other commercial loans 
allowance for loan losses peoples allowance for loan losses totaled million at december   compared to million at the prior year end  with million of the increase attributable to the first colony acquisition 
as a percentage of total loans  the allowance was at december  compared to at december  the decrease in the allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans is a result of internal loan growth and acquiring million of loans through acquisitions 
the acquired portfolio was primarily residential and consumer loans with a lower credit risk profile and allowance coverage of 
the remaining increase is due to the provision for loan losses  net of chargeoffs and recoveries 
the allowance is allocated among the loan categories based upon the consistent  quarterly procedural discipline described in the critical accounting policies section of this discussion 
however  the entire allowance for loan losses is available to absorb future loan losses in any loan category 
the following schedule details the allocation of the allowance for loan losses at december dollars in thousands percent percent percent allocation of loans allocation of loans allocation of loans of in each of in each of in each allowance category allowance category allowance category for loan to total for loan to total for loan to total losses loans losses loans losses loans commercial    real estate    consumer    overdrafts credit card general risk total    the allowance allocated to commercial loans has increased in recent periods  reflecting the higher credit risk associated with this type of lending and the continued growth in this portfolio 
in and  the commercial loan balance grew by and  respectively  over the prior year balance 
the allowance allocated to the real estate and consumer loan portfolios is based upon peoples allowance methodology for homogeneous loans  and increases or decreases in loan balances of those portfolios 
in  peoples refined its systematic methodology in the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses to allocations of general credit risk to specific loans or homogenous groups 
as a result  the allocation for general credit risk has been assigned to loss factors developed from historical data to make them more representative of those which may be expected in the current economic environment 
in  net loan chargeoffs were  compared to  in while commercial and consumer loans continue to comprise the majority of net chargeoffs  overdraft privilege accounted for nearly half of the total increase from the prior year  totaling  or of net chargeoffs  in commercial loans accounted for of net chargeoffs in versus a year ago  while consumer loans excluding overdraft privilege comprised and  for the same periods  respectively 
in addition to overdraft privilege  net chargeoffs in were also impacted by peoples charging down a group of troubled commercial loans  to amounts deemed collectible  in the first half of these loans were part of a single relationship with a client in the business of leasing equipment primarily to health care professionals and accounted for million of commercial chargeoffs in management does not anticipate any future loss from this relationship 
asset quality remains a key focus  as management continues to stress quality rather than growth in response to the current economic conditions 
at december   peoples nonperforming assets which include loans days or more past due  nonaccrual loans  renegotiated loans  and other real estate owned totaled  or of total assets  up from million  or of total assets  at december  peoples allowance for loan losses totaled of nonperforming loans at december   versus at december  management continues to review the entire loan portfolio as part of the risk management process and will deal aggressively with problem loans as they are identified to minimize the amount of any future loss 
although nonperforming assets have increased  total loan delinquencies have declined since year end  largely attributable to fewer loans that were days past due 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that peoples will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the measurement of potential impaired loan losses is generally based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s historical effective interest rate  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
if foreclosure is probable  impairment loss is measured based on the fair value of the collateral 
at december   the recorded investment in loans that were considered to be impaired was million  of which million were accruing interest  and million were nonaccrual loans 
included in this amount were million of impaired loans for which the related allowance for loan losses was  the remaining impaired loan balances do not have a related allocation of the allowance for loan losses because the loans have been previously written down  are well secured  or possess characteristics indicative of the ability to repay the loan 
in  peoples average recorded investment in impaired loans was approximately million and interest income of  was recognized on impaired loans during the period  representing of peoples total interest income 
funding sources peoples considers a number of sources when evaluating funding needs  including but not limited to deposits  short term borrowings  and long term borrowings 
deposits  both interest bearing and non interest bearing  continue to be the most significant source of funds for peoples  totaling million  or of total funding sources  at december  non interest bearing deposits serve as a core funding source 
at december   non interest bearing deposit balances totaled million  up million or compared to the prior year end 
peoples acquired non interest bearing deposit balances of approximately million through acquisitions in in addition  peoples implemented two programs in the first quarter of aimed at attracting new clients and core deposits  as well as producing additional revenue opportunities overdraft privilege and free checking 
these programs have had a positive impact by generating many new non interest bearing accounts 
management will continue to focus on expanding its base of lower cost funding sources and enhancing client relationships by providing incentives for clients to utilize more of peoples products and services 
interest bearing deposits totaled million at december   an increase of million or compared to million at december   with acquisitions accounting for about million of the growth 
savings balances increased million or since year end peoples introduced a new savings product for its public funds customers states and political subdivisions  which comprised million of savings balances at year end and of the growth during the year 
certificates of deposit remain peoples largest group of interest bearing deposits  totaling million at december   up million or since the prior year end  with acquisitions accounting for nearly of the increase 
interest bearing transaction accounts primarily peoples money market deposit accounts  are also a significant portion of peoples interest bearing deposits  totaling million at december   compared to million at year end peoples also accesses other funding sources  including short term and long term borrowings  to fund asset growth and satisfy liquidity needs 
peoples short term borrowings include repurchase agreements  a short term loan from an unrelated financial institution and fhlb advances  while long term borrowings are primarily year fhlb advances  with initial fixed rate features for periods of two  three  or four years  depending on the specific advance 
each year advance has the opportunity  at the discretion of the fhlb  to reprice after its initial fixed rate period  and peoples has the option to prepay any repriced advance without penalty  or allow the borrowing to reprice to a libor based  variable rate product 
in addition to these convertible rate advances  recent long term fhlb advances have included fixed rate  amortizing advances  which helps peoples manage its interest rate sensitivity 
at december   long term borrowings totaled million  up million or from million at december  this increase is the result of peoples emphasis on securing longer term funding to lock in costs during this period of low interest rates 
peoples short term borrowings totaled million  down million or compared to year end peoples obtained a million short term loan from an unrelated financial institution to provide initial funding for the first colony acquisition  which partially offset the reduction in short term fhlb borrowings 
management is evaluating various long term funding alternatives in anticipation of converting this short term loan to longer term financing during the first half of capital stockholders equity at december   stockholders equity was million  an increase of million or since december   primarily the result of peoples common stock issuance 
in late december  peoples issued  common shares generating capital of million after offering expenses 
in addition to this new capital  peoples earnings in  net of dividends paid  accounted for million of the increase 
in  peoples paid dividends of million  representing a dividend payout ratio of of earnings  compared to a ratio of a year ago 
while management anticipates peoples continuing its year history of consistent dividend growth in future periods  peoples bancorp s ability to pay dividends on its common shares largely depends on receipt of dividends from peoples bank 
in addition  other restrictions and limitations may prohibit peoples from paying dividends even when sufficient cash is available 
further discussion regarding restrictions on peoples ability to pay future dividends can be found in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k  as well as the limits on dividends section under item of this form k 
the adjustment for the net unrealized holding gains on available for sale securities  net of deferred income taxes  also increased equity 
at december   net unrealized holding gains totaled million versus million at december   a change of million 
since all the investment securities in peoples portfolio are classified as available for sale  both the investment and equity sections of peoples balance sheet are more sensitive to the changing market values of investments than if the investment portfolio was classified as held to maturity 
at december   peoples had treasury stock totaling million compared to million at year end  a decrease of million or 
in  peoples reissued approximately  treasury shares through various stock option plans and peoples deferred compensation plan 
peoples also repurchased  common shares at an average price of per share 
at this time  management does not anticipate any treasury stock purchases in other than purchases relating to peoples deferred compensation plan  which accounted for of the common shares repurchased in in addition to monitoring performance through traditional capital measurements ie  dividend payout ratios and roe  peoples has also complied with the capital adequacy standards mandated by the banking industry 
peoples and peoples bank have complied with these requirements and were considered well capitalized institutions at december  further information regarding peoples risk based capital ratios can be found in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
interest rate sensitivity and liquidity the objective of the asset liability management function is to guide management in the acquisition of earning assets  while securing the most appropriate funding  with the goal being to optimize net interest income within the constraints of prudent capital adequacy  liquidity  and safety 
this objective requires peoples to manage the balance sheet mix of assets and liabilities with a focus on interest rate risk exposure and adequate liquidity 
external factors  such as changes in economic conditions  current and future interest rate levels and customer preferences must also be considered 
interest rate risk one of the most significant risks resulting from peoples normal business of extending loans and accepting deposits is interest rate risk 
interest rate risk irr is the potential for economic loss due to future interest rate changes that can impact both the earnings stream as well as market values of financial assets and liabilities 
peoples has charged the alco with the overall management of peoples balance sheet and off balance sheet hedging transactions related to the management of irr 
it is the alco s responsibility to keep peoples focused on the future by evaluating trends and potential future events  researching alternatives  then recommending and authorizing an appropriate course of action 
to this end  the alco has established an irr management policy that sets the minimum requirements and guidelines for monitoring and managing the level and amount of irr 
the objective of the irr policy is to encourage management to adhere to sound fundamentals of banking while allowing sufficient flexibility to exercise the creativity and innovations necessary to meet the challenges and opportunities of changing markets 
the ultimate goal of these policies is to optimize net interest income within the constraints of prudent capital adequacy  liquidity  and safety 
peoples alco relies on different methods of assessing irr  including simulations to project future net interest income  to monitor the sensitivity of the net present market value of equity and difference  or gap  between maturing or rate sensitive assets and liabilities over various time periods 
peoples also uses these methods to monitor irr for both the short and long term 
the alco places emphasis on simulation modeling as the most beneficial measurement of irr because it is a dynamic measure 
by employing a simulation process that estimates the impact of potential changes in interest rates and balance sheet structures and by establishing limits on these estimated changes to net income and net market value  the alco is better able to evaluate interest rate risks and their potential impact to earnings and market value of equity 
the modeling process starts with a base case simulation using the current balance sheet 
base case simulation results are prepared under an assumed flat interest rate scenario and at least two alternative interest rate scenarios  one rising and one declining  assuming parallel yield curve parameters 
comparisons produced from the simulation data  showing the earnings variance from the flat rate forecast  illustrate the risks associated with the current balance sheet structure 
additional simulations  when deemed appropriate  are prepared using different interest rate scenarios than those used with the base case simulation and or possible changes in balance sheet structure 
the additional simulations are used to better evaluate risks and highlight opportunities inherent in the modeled balance sheet 
comparisons showing the earnings and equity value variance from the base case are provided to the alco for review and discussion 
the results from these model simulations are evaluated for indications of effectiveness of current irr management strategies 
as part of the evaluation of irr  the alco has established limits on changes in net interest income and the net value of the balance sheet have been established 
the alco limits the decrease in net interest income of peoples bank to or less from base case for each basis point shift in interest rates measured over a twelve month period assuming a static balance sheet 
the alco limits the negative impact on net equity value to or less given an immediate and sustained basis points shift in interest rates also assuming a static balance sheet 
the alco also reviews static gap measures for specific time periods focusing on one year cumulative gap 
at december   peoples one year cumulative gap amount was positive of earning assets  which represented million more in assets than liabilities that may reprice during that period 
based on historical trends and performance  the alco has determined the ratio of the one year cumulative gap should be within of earning assets 
results that are greater than any of these limits will prompt a discussion by alco of appropriate actions  if any  that should be taken 
the following table is provided to illustrate the estimated earnings at risk and value at risk positions of peoples  on a pre tax basis  at december  dollars in thousands immediate estimated estimated interest rate increase decrease in decrease increase decrease increase in basis points in net interest income economic value of equity the interest rate risk analysis shows that peoples is asset sensitive  which means that increasing interest rates should favorably impact peoples net interest income while downward moving interest rates should negatively impact net interest income 
peoples became asset sensitive during the fourth quar ter of due to an increase in rate sensitive assets attributable to investment portfolio activity as well as continued efforts to secure longer term funding in the current low interest rate environment 
as part of this process  management has priced peoples and year certificates of deposit to make them more attractive to clients than shorter term certificates 
many clients have shifted  and continue to shift  funds to the longer term certificates as their existing deposits mature 
the interest rate analysis also shows peoples is within the established irr policy limits for all simulations and all scenarios for the current period 
the alco implemented a hedge position to help protect peoples net interest income streams in the event of rising rates which will complement the current slightly asset sensitive position 
in early october  the alco hedged a million long term  fixed rate borrowing from the fhlb that may convert to a variable rate  at the fhlb s discretion 
in addition  the alco may consider additional hedging options for peoples variable rate liabilities  including  but not limited to  the purchase of other interest rate hedge positions  as available and appropriate  that would provide net interest income protection in a rising rate environment 
liquidity in addition to irr management  a primary objective of the alco is the maintenance of a sufficient level of liquidity 
the alco defines liquidity as the ability to meet anticipated and unanticipated operating cash needs  loan demand  and deposit withdrawals  without incurring a sustained negative impact on profitability 
the alco s liquidity management policy sets limits on the net liquidity position of peoples and the concentration of non core funding sources  both total wholesale funding and reliance on brokered deposits 
typically  the main source of liquidity for peoples is deposit growth 
liquidity is also provided from cash generated from earning assets such as maturities  principal payments and income from loans and investment securities 
in  cash provided by financing activities totaled million  due largely to increases in deposit balances of million and proceeds from issuance of common shares of million 
cash used in investing activity totaled million  due to investment securities purchases  net of maturities and sales  of million and a net increase in loan balances totaling million  which was partially offset by net cash of million received from acquisitions 
when appropriate  peoples takes advantage of external sources of funds  such as advances from the fhlb  national market repurchase agreements  and brokered funds 
these external sources often provide attractive interest rates and flexible maturity dates that better enable peoples to match funding dates and pricing characteristics with contractual maturity dates and pricing parameters of earning assets 
at december   peoples had available borrowing capacity of approximately million through these external sources and unpledged securities in the investment portfolio of approximately million that can be utilized as an additional source of liquidity 
the net liquidity position of peoples is calculated by subtracting volatile funds from liquid assets 
peoples volatile funds consist primarily of short term growth in deposits  while liquid assets includes short term investments and unpledged available for sale securities 
at december   peoples net liquidity position was million  or of total assets  compared to million  or of total assets  at december  this decrease in liquidity position as a percent of total assets was attributed to an million increase in volatile funds and peoples million loan to provide the initial financing for the first colony acquisition 
this increase in volatile funds partially offset an increase in liquid assets from investment security purchases 
the liquidity position as of december   was within peoples policy limit of negative of total assets 
at december   total wholesale funding comprised of total assets and brokered funds were of total assets  which was within peoples policy limits of and  respectively 
off balance sheet activities and contractual obligations peoples routinely engages in activities that involve  to varying degrees  elements of risk that are not reflected in whole or in part in the consolidated financial statements 
these activities are part of peoples normal course of business and include traditional off balance sheet credit related financial instruments  interest rate contracts  operating leases  long term debt and commitments to make additional capital contributions in low income housing project investments 
traditional off balance sheet credit related financial instruments are primarily commitments to extend credit  and standby letters of credit 
these activities could require peoples to make cash payments to third parties in the event certain specified future events occur 
the contractual amounts represent the extent of peoples exposure in these off balance sheet activities 
however  since certain off balance sheet commitments  particularly standby letters of credit  are expected to expire or be only partially used  the total amount of commitments does not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
management believes these activities are necessary to meet the financing needs of customers and or manage peoples exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
peoples also enters into interest rate contracts under which peoples is required to either receive cash from or pay cash to counter parties depending on changes in interest rates 
interest rate contracts are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheet  with the fair value representing the net present value of expected future cash receipts or payments based on market interest rates as of the balance sheet date 
as a result  the amounts recorded on the balance sheet at december   do not represent the amounts that may ultimately be paid or received under these contracts 
for further discussion regarding financial instruments with off balance sheet risk  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
management does not anticipate peoples current off balance sheet activities will have a material impact on future results of operation and financial condition 
peoples continues to lease certain banking facilities and equipment under noncancelable operating leases with terms providing for fixed monthly payments over periods ranging from two to fifteen years 
the majority of peoples leased banking facilities are inside retail shopping centers and  as a result  are not available for purchase 
management believes these leased facilities increase peoples visibility within its markets and affords sales associates additional access to current and potential clients 
for further information regarding peoples future obligations under existing operating leases  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
effects of inflation on financial statements substantially all of peoples assets relate to banking and are monetary in nature 
as a result  inflation does not impact peoples to the same degree as companies in capital intensive industries in a replacement cost environment 
during a period of rising prices  a net monetary asset position results in a loss in purchasing power and conversely a net monetary liability position results in an increase in purchasing power 
the opposite would be true during a period of decreasing prices 
in the banking industry  typically monetary assets exceed monetary liabilities 
the current monetary policy targeting low levels of inflation has resulted in relatively stable price levels 
therefore  inflation has had little impact on peoples net assets 
future outlook in  peoples results reflect success in several key performance areas  as earnings per share and return on equity reached record levels 
ultimately  future success in the financial service industry revolves around three issues growth and quality of earnings  asset quality  and a strong capital base 
top line revenues are strong and peoples sales management teams are focused on integrated financial service offerings to clients through a needs based sales approach 
asset quality remains a key focus for management  as peoples works to improve performance ratios to the levels of high performing financial services companies 
peoples capital ratios  particularly tangible capital  reached new highs  due in part to the common stock offering  and remain strongly positioned above well capitalized minimums  providing a solid foundation to withstand the impact of adverse economic conditions  as well as providing opportunities for strategic growth 
peoples has made sizeable investments in technology and personnel in recent periods 
these investments are part of peoples strategy to provide clients with speedy  technologically superior services that make it easier for them to complete their transaction and conduct business with peoples 
in  management expects peoples to invest additional resources in new technologies  such as customer relationship management and profitability systems  as well as explore possible new e service capabilities 
while these investments could increase operating expenses  management believes they will help strengthen client relationships  increase peoples long term stakeholder value and enhance future revenue growth opportunities 
peoples business strategy also incorporates a focus on retail products and services  including increasing core deposits and real estate lending 
as a result  one of management s strategic goals in is to improve peoples retail loan efforts 
in the first quarter of  management plans to reorganize peoples real estate loan delivery methods by creating new loan originator positions 
these loan originators will be specifically responsible for originating real estate loans and home equity loans and will be located throughout peoples primary market area 
management intends to fill these positions either with existing associates or new hires 
this shift to specialists will help peoples associates become more focused on the nuances of real estate loans and allow peoples to better penetrate its markets 
personal bankers will continue to serve the deposit and personal loan needs of customers and make loan referrals to the loan originators 
another strategic goal is to increase core deposits  specifically non interest bearing demand deposits  to a larger percentage of total funding sources 
in  management will strive to grow demand deposits to of total customer funding sources from year end s and ultimately to of total customer funding sources by year end management believes the combination of a growing branch network and extended hours in some offices will allow peoples to successfully compete for core deposits  plus technology  such as internet banking and free online billpay 
in the end  if peoples is successful in penetrating its customer base through a deposit account and a real estate loan  sales associates can work to extend the relationship to peoples other products and services  such as investments and insurance 
in  peoples was successful in growing non interest revenues  primarily deposit account service charges  due in part to the development and implementation of the overdraft privilege program 
however  peoples is obligated to pay professional fees to the consultant who developed the process based on revenue parameters  with that amount totaling just over  in additional net revenues from overdraft privilege ie after provision for bad debt have more than offset the professional expenses associated with the new product 
beginning in march  the percentage of revenues paid to the consultant will decrease 
therefore  management does not expect these professional fees to increase significantly in in addition  the contract expires in february  which should further enhance revenue streams going forward assuming peoples maintains and or grows total retail core deposits and volumes remain stable 
as part of the kentucky bancshares acquisition and the transition of the five full service offices of kentucky bank trust to peoples bank offices  peoples has decided to close the current russell  kentucky office of peoples bank concurrently with the targeted completion date for the kentucky bancshares acquisition of may  management believes kentucky bank trust s russell office gives peoples current and future customers the best location in russell to do their banking 
the cost savings are part of the overall integration plan for the kentucky bancshares acquisition 
after the acquisition  peoples will have offices in the three county area of greenup  boyd and carter counties in northeastern kentucky 
peoples will rank second in the three county market with full service locations  and third in the market with over million of total deposits 
mergers and acquisitions  such as the kentucky bancshares acquisition  have been an integral part of peoples efforts to expand its operations and scope of client services even while management continues to build client relationships and implements new products and services to enhance peoples earnings potential 
peoples enhanced regulatory capital ratios as a result of the common stock offering afford management additional growth opportunities through mergers and acquisitions 
as a result of increased tangible equity to total assets  management believes peoples is positioned to continue its disciplined acquisition strategy of the past decade 
as a result  management plans to dedicate more resources to develop and realize acquisition opportunities in and around peoples markets 
however  the evaluation of future acquisitions will focus more on opportunities that complement peoples core competencies and strategic intent rather than geographic location or proximity to current markets 
peoples remains a service oriented company with a sales focus that aims to satisfy clients through a relationship sales process 
through this process  sales associates work to anticipate  uncover  and solve their clients every financial need  from insurance to banking to investments 
management will continue to be stakeholder focused with four key long term objectives double digit eps growth  roe improvement  consistent dividend growth  and revenue diversification 
forward looking statements the statements in this form k which are not historical fact are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and the private securities litigation reform act of although management believes peoples plans  intentions and expectations reflected in or suggested by these forward looking statements are reasonable  peoples cannot give any assurance that those plans  intentions or expectations will be achieved 
the forward looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  the effect of changes in interest rates  the effect of federal and state banking and tax regulations  the effect of technological changes  the effect of economic conditions  the effect of competitive products and pricing  and other risks detailed in peoples securities and exchange commission filings 
all forward looking statements are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements 
although management believes the expectations in these forward looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of management s knowledge of peoples business and operations  it is possible that actual results may differ materially from these projections 
comparison of to peoples reported net income of million in  up from million in diluted earnings per share were for the year ended december   compared to in in  peoples improved earnings resulted from net interest income growth of million  as well as increased non interest revenues of million 
return on average assets was in  compared to in  while return on stockholders equity was and  for the same periods respectively 
peoples return on equity was negatively impacted by the mark to market adjustment on available for sale securities  which resulted in an increase in equity 
net interest income totaled million in  up compared to the prior year  as total interest income grew to million and interest expense declined to million 
net interest margin was in versus in peoples improved net interest margin in resulted from lower costs of funds in response to rate reductions by the federal reserve open market committee 
the yield on earning assets dropped to for the year ended december   compared to for the prior year  while the cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points to during the same period 
peoples provision for loan losses totaled million in  up from s expense of million 
the combination of increased loan volume  less favorable loss experience  and a general economic slowdown resulted in the increased provision in at december   peoples allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was  compared to a year end ratio of 
non interest income totaled  in  an increase of compared to in  deposit account service charge income increased  to  from  in  due to higher volumes of overdraft and non sufficient fund fees 
income from fiduciary activities totaled  down compared to the prior year 
electronic banking income grew in  from  in electronic banking income increased primarily due to growth in the number of debit card users and the associated volume increases in debit card usage 
insurance and investment commissions were  in versus  in boli income totaled million in compared to no income in due to the timing of the purchase in mid for the year ended december   non interest expense totaled million  up million compared to increased salaries and benefits accounted for the majority of the expense growth in  totaling million versus million the prior year 
peoples also experienced slight increases in amortization of intangible assets  as well as data processing and software costs 
peoples other non interest expenses were near prior period levels 
total assets reached billion at december   versus billion at year end gross loans remain the largest component of peoples earning assets  totaling million at year end  up million from december   with growth occurring in the commercial and real estate loan portfolios 
average loans totaled of average deposits in  compared to in peoples other significant earning asset component is the investment securities portfolio  which totaled million at year end  virtually unchanged from the prior year end 
liabilities totaled billion at year end compared to billion a year ago  an increase of million

during  deposits grew million from million at december   as interest bearing balances were up million to million and non interest bearing deposits increased million to million 
borrowed funds declined from million at december   to million at year end stockholders equity totaled million at december   versus million at december   an increase of million 
the higher level of equity in is due in part to increased earnings  net of dividends paid 
the remaining increase in equity was a result of a positive change in market value of peoples available for sale investment securities
