btp manufacturing opportunities also allow endwave to capture manufacturing volume and associated revenues without expending the substantial engineering investments typically associated with rf product design effort 
telecommunications industry overview the telecommunications industry has seen many significant changes and developments over the last few years 
the rapid acceptance and broad use of the internet has created the need for communications networks that are capable of handling large amounts of digital traffic 
the widespread use of wireless communications and the desire for mobile  high speed internet access by consumers and businesses has created needs for communication solutions that have not been met by traditional wire line systems 
the continued growth in the use of cellular phones and other wireless communications devices  such as pc and personal digital assistants pdas  has created a large market for broadband wireless infrastructure 
developing countries realize that a key requirement 
table of contents for their economic growth is the availability of modern communications systems to provide widely available and reliable phone and data services 
rather than installing the traditional wired networks  they often chose cellular networks as the best solution since they are the easiest and fastest to deploy and provide the mobility that so many desire 
in such countries where wired infrastructure is unavailable or expensive  the interconnection of the various cell sites is accomplished by the use of microwave radio links 
developing nations such as china and india have created a significant demand for such microwave radio links 
in europe and other developed countries  as new networks are deployed or additional cell sites are installed to handle increased traffic density  these new cell sites are also often connected to the existing networks through the use of microwave radio links 
this application  commonly referred to as cellular backhaul  has caused the installation of hundreds of thousands of radio links over the last decade 
as users desire messaging services and internet access from their cellular phones and pdas  network integrators and service providers are expected to move to new generations of cellular systems known as g and g or rd generation systems 
some people predict that these new systems will require as much as three times the number of base stations as first generation systems and that each base station will require higher capacity backhaul to the network 
when these next generation systems are deployed  they will create a demand for a large number of new microwave radios 
in addition  as spectrums become crowded and cost of bandwidth increases  network operators will require higher performance radios that provide higher capacities and greater spectral efficiency 
today  businesses and consumers are fueling the need for additional bandwidth in the internet infrastructure with the growing use of e mail  audio  and video streaming  corporate data networks  corporate websites  e commerce  electronic data exchange  customer support  supply chain management and telecommuting 
to adequately satisfy these needs  service providers must be able to transport large quantities of data  at high speed to almost any location  often world wide 
since not all locations are served by high speed copper wire or fiber optic cable  there is a growing need for broadband wireless access 
although over the long term we believe these fundamental forces are creating needs for greater capacity in the telecommunications infrastructure and for wireless access to that network  the last two years have been very challenging for the broadband wireless industry  including the service providers  system integrators  oems and their suppliers 
during this period  new cell phone subscription rates continued to decrease  introduction of and g networks were delayed  deployment of broadband wireless access systems failed to develop as expected and the situation was made worse by a major slowdown in the us and world economies 
capital expenditures  which had been at unusually high levels for several years  plummeted 
several of the clecs competitive local exchange carrier  including teligent  winstar and art  declared bankruptcy and have recently re emerged but with limited plans for further network build outs 
although deployment by clecs of microwave radio systems for high speed access came to a virtual halt in north america  installation of cellular networks around the world using microwave radio links continued at a somewhat slower  but relatively healthy rate 
the annual production of point to point microwave radios in was approximately  units and approximately of which were used for cellular backhaul applications 
more than of these were in the to ghz frequency range  where our design and manufacturing processes are focused 
the production of these point to point microwave radios is concentrated in a relatively small number of oems 
of the approximately  radios produced last year  the top manufacturers produced more than of the total 
the largest oem producers include alcatel  stratex networks  ericsson  harris  nec  nera  nokia and siemens 
these oems are in turn supplied key components and sub assemblies either by captive internal sources  or by merchant suppliers such as endwave 
of these external merchant suppliers  endwave has the significant market share 
several of our competitors are financially weak and several have exited the business in the past two years 
some industry observers believe that the component and sub assembly supplier base will undergo consolidation  and endwave in particular has a stated plan to take a leading role in this industry consolidation trend 

table of contents the challenge forecasts for future demand of our products and the products of our customers are uncertain 
it is difficult to accurately predict how long the current economic conditions will continue in the united states and other parts of the world  or whether they will improve 
regulatory conditions affecting radio deployments around the world are changing 
new spectrums are being allocated and new wireless applications are being created 
these uncertain and changing conditions make it very hard for our customers to predict their specific future product requirements with certainty 
however  we believe that in order to be successful in the future our customers will need higher performance products  lower product costs  scalable production with high volume capacity  short product design cycles  broad product portfolio  logistical flexibility  and carrier class quality 
emerging market opportunities new applications for wireless access technologies are developing at both ends of the spectrum 
on the lower end of the frequency range at ghz and ghz  the specifications commonly referred to as wi fi are becoming a de facto standard for short range wireless computing 
business professionals  students  and mobile professionals are embracing the technology as the method of choice for connecting to the internet and corporate networks in a mobile setting  and while moving about in office buildings and campuses 
wi fi enabled devices are expected to nearly double from million shipments in to million in  and is expected to represent a billion business in although endwave s core competencies lie at frequency ranges above ghz  we believe that the broad adoption of wi fi technology will create demand for high capacity backhaul links from the wifi access point back to the local switching office  and similar to the cellular backhaul market  will drive demand for wi fi backhaul in licensed bands that are in endwave s frequency regime 
at the higher end of the spectrum  new interest at ghz and ghz is emerging in the form of request for the federal communications commission fcc to allocate ghz of spectrum in both bands for broadband access 
a filing by loea communications requesting rulemaking at ghz ghz and ghz ghz has caused many industry leaders to watch this development closely 
cisco systems  on behalf of bridgewave  ceragon networks  endwave corporation  loea communications  and stratex networks has filed comments with the fcc for proposed rulemaking for these bands 
it is expected that the fcc will rule on this matter in the next months 
if allocated as currently proposed  this spectrum would be well suited to deliver data rates of gbps over distances of approximately kilometers 
this distance and data rate capability make the technology well suited to serve the of the  business buildings that are within mile of the nearest fiber connection and cannot practically access the fiber 
although there is no certainty that spectrum will be allocated at these frequencies  or how it s allocation may impact the business potential  we are one of a few companies that is capable of designing  developing  testing and manufacturing the rf front end for these high frequency wireless systems 

table of contents our solution as a provider of rf subsystems  we design and manufacture a broad portfolio of products  from rf modules to fully integrated transceivers and outdoor units and strive to provide our customers  original equipment manufacturers and wireless systems integrators  with the products  resources and services that they need to be successful in this changing environment 
we provide superior performance through technological leadership 
technological leadership begins with the people  their capabilities and their experience 
we have a large technical team with broad expertise in device physics  semiconductor device design  circuit design  component and or subsystem design  test engineering and other critical disciplines 
our technical leadership enables us to optimize our products for critical performance factors that are important to our customers 
we provide the technology to optimize such key parameters as spectral efficiency  which is the rate at which data can be transmitted in a given segment of the radio frequency spectrum 
we have extensive experience in the design of rf devices based on gallium arsenide  the semiconductor material most widely used in broadband wireless access applications as well as other less commonly used rf semiconductor materials 
this design expertise gives us the flexibility to optimize our product designs because we are not limited to standard  commercially available semiconductor devices 
we use third party semiconductor fabrication facilities to manufacture the gallium arsenide and other semiconductor devices we design 
our use of third party semiconductor facilities gives us the flexibility to use the process technology that is best suited for each application and eliminates the need for us to invest in and maintain our own fabrication facilities 
path to low cost through multiple circuit technologies 
with our proprietary circuit and process technologies  coupled with our world class manufacturing processes  we are able to provide better solutions related to our customers volume and cost requirements 
we employ three distinct circuit technologies as appropriate to meet the needs of our customers and their specific project  including traditional hybrid microwave integrated circuits hmic  monolithic microwave integrated circuits mmic  and flip chip integrated circuits fcic 
hmics  have many bond wires that must be individually tested and adjusted  or tuned  during the manufacturing process 
our mmic circuits eliminate most of the bond wires used in hmics  allowing us to produce them using automated assembly techniques 
our patented fcic technology enables us to design and manufacture rf circuits with less gallium arsenide material than a typical mmic circuit and significantly fewer wire bonds than hmics 
as a result  fcic circuits lend themselves to high volume  automated manufacturing processes for applications characterized by very high unit volumes 
these circuit advantages  coupled with our award winning lean manufacturing process have allowed us to significantly reduce costs 
short product design cycle 
we have developed an extensive library of rf circuit and device designs that allow us to rapidly and economically combine standard circuits and devices into custom assemblies to quickly satisfy the various performance and frequency requirements of our customers 
we have the expertise and facilities to take advantage of traditional circuit manufacturing technologies to rapidly prototype and test a new design 
after prototyping in traditional hmic technology  we can update the design to utilize mmic  or our proprietary fcic technology for lower cost and high volume manufacturing 
we believe that this ability to migrate from prototype to volume production in a short period of time is an important competitive advantage 
broad product portfolio 
we offer a range of products at multiple levels of integration  from single function rf modules to integrated transceivers  to address most any customer need 
this allows our customers to select the products that best complement their internal capabilities and manufacturing requirements 
our product design capability supports a broad range of frequencies  from ghz to ghz  and addresses multiple market applications 
this enables our customers to rapidly design products for new frequencies or applications 
scalable manufacturing with high volume production capability 
we believe we are one of the largest suppliers of rf subsystems focused on broadband wireless solutions 
our traditional manufacturing approach allows our customers to develop new products in relatively small quantities during the early stages of development 
as their design becomes proven and is moved into production  these products can either be 
table of contents maintained with traditional assembly approaches  moved into an automated process where volumes justify this transition  or moved to our offshore manufacturing facility 
our advanced assembly and testing capabilities and multiple production lines allow us to rapidly achieve high volume production to meet our customers increasing volume demands 
we have a long term gallium arsenide device supply agreement with velocium  a former wholly owned subsidiary of trw which is now an operating unit of northrop grumman space and mission systems corp  which further enhances our manufacturing capabilities and ensures an adequate supply of gallium arsenide devices 
logistical flexibility 
we provide our customers with a high degree of logistical flexibility through the use of multi year frame agreements with logistical plans that are tailored to their individual needs 
these frame agreements usually cover a variety of products and frequencies  with varying degrees of flexibility on quantities and delivery rates 
this allows our customers to rapidly adjust to the changing demands of their market 
high quality 
our customers  whether focused in telecommunications  defense or other adjacent markets  expend considerable financial and human resource to develop and introduce new products 
understandably  they have high demands for quality and reliability once they ve completed their development and are preparing to take their product to market 
many customers find it necessary to design their systems so they will operate or even of the time 
our careful design  advanced manufacturing and iso certified facilities are intended to provide the high reliability required for today s commercial systems 
our strategy our objective is to be the leading global supplier of rf subsystems for broadband wireless applications 
we intend to become the rf subsystem supplier of choice for broadband wireless systems built by the leading companies in telecommunications and other markets 
the major elements of our strategy include maintain and expand our strong position in our core market 
the majority of our revenue is derived from production of low and medium data rate radios  in the to ghz frequency range  for use in cellular backhaul systems 
today this represents the largest and one of the most stable portions of the market 
we intend to maintain and expand our penetration in these areas  both in terms of current and new customers  customer programs  and frequency ranges 
extend our technological leadership 
we will continue to invest in next generation research and development  maintain our team of the most talented engineers and scientists  and build on our manufacturing technologies 
provide our customers with increased logistical flexibility 
in this uncertain market  it is difficult for our customers to predict exact products  frequencies and quantities 
by developing broader band circuits and by using multi product  multi year supply agreements  flexible logistics plans and short manufacturing cycles  we enable our customers to quickly respond to market demands 
target new frequencies and emerging applications 
we currently offer a wide range of products that support the principal frequency bands currently used for broadband wireless backhaul and access  and defense applications 
we intend to offer products for higher data rate radios  new frequency bands and emerging market applications as opportunities arise 
provide best in class manufacturing capability 
our circuit design  manufacturing and testing processes and continuous improvement programs have helped to bring manufacturing innovations to an industry that has historically utilized labor intensive manufacturing techniques 
we will continue to improve our lean manufacturing methods that have produced significant cost reductions and significantly higher outputs with fewer employed assets 

table of contents reduce costs through offshore manufacturing 
we have responded to customer and market requirements for lower cost solutions with the establishment of a partnership with a world class manufacturing facility in southeast asia 
within that facility we utilize both a standard contract manufacturing line managed by our partner and an endwave managed manufacturing line 
this partnership and the product manufacturing is managed by our full time  in country management team with extensive experience in process engineering and manufacturing management 
we draw on the local economy to obtain lower cost of materials  labor  and facilities than is available in the united states 
maintain rapid design and prototyping capability 
we intend to maintain our ability to rapidly design and prototype new products that meet our customers needs 
we believe we can achieve this with our multiple design and manufacturing techniques 
leverage strategic relationship with velocium 
our supply agreement with velocium  a former wholly owned subsidiary of trw which is now an operating unit of northrop grumman  provides us with a long term supply of gallium arsenide devices at preferred cost 
we believe that our supply of these devices from velocium is a competitive advantage because the supply of gallium arsenide devices may become constrained in the future as the broadband wireless access market grows 
in addition  we have access to velocium s research and design expertise in the areas of rf and digital circuit design technologies as well as advanced semiconductor materials 
we believe this access represents a significant competitive advantage 
balance production capacity to market demand 
the demand for rf products is volatile 
as the demand varies  we will adjust our manufacturing capacity to meet market demand 
we have flexible facilities and equipment so adjusting to changes in market demands is largely a matter of adjusting work force levels accordingly 
secure new design wins to expand and diversify our customer base 
we intend to use our technology  skilled design teams  short design cycles and manufacturing capability to secure new designs wins with new and existing customers  with special attention to those top microwave radio suppliers who represent over of the total demand 
use our unique strengths to further penetrate adjacent markets 
we have unique technology  experience  and capabilities in the design of high volume microwave modules and subsystems in the to ghz frequency range 
these are attributes that are useful in other adjacent markets such as instrumentation  scientific  automotive radar  security  fiber optics and military systems 
we will continue to pursue additional opportunities in these adjacent markets where our technologies are advantageous 
pursue additional acquisitions where appropriate 
in order to achieve our goal of being the leading global supplier of rf subsystems  we intend to continue to pursue additional acquisition opportunities that are strategically advantageous and financially accretive 
products our products include amplifiers  multipliers  frequency converters  oscillators  frequency synthesizers  integrated transceivers and outdoor units odus that enable the transmission and reception of data signals in communication applications such as cellular backhaul  broadband wireless access  and network trunking  as well as other adjacent markets requiring these technologies and products 
in addition to those products designed and developed by endwave  we also provide build to print manufacturing services for products that have been designed by our customers 
while the majority of our existing customers are wireless systems integrators and original equipment manufacturers serving the broadband wireless market  a portion of our revenues are derived from customers who use our products to satisfy needs for military  instrumentation  scientific and other adjacent markets 

table of contents transceivers are our core product offering  representing approximately of our net revenues for transceivers are a critical subsystem found in microwave and millimeter wave radios 
these subsystems function as the heart of the wireless system by combining transmit and receive functions in a single package  which gets built into the overall radio system 
endwave specializes in high frequency transceivers in the range of ghz to ghz  for point to point and point to multipoint communications applications 
customers we sell our products primarily to global wireless systems integrators and original equipment manufacturers 
during we shipped products to more that different customers 
the ten customers that attributed the greatest proportion of our revenues in the year ended december   were allgon ab sweden anritsu corporation usa lockheed martin corporation usa microelectronics technology  inc mti taiwan nokia networks finland northrop grumman space and mission systems corp 
usa siemens ag italy stratex networks  inc usa tasc  inc usa witcom ltd 
israel a relatively limited number of customers have historically accounted for a substantial portion of our sales 
for the years ended december  and  sales to our largest customer  nokia  accounted for and of our total revenue  respectively 
for the year ended december   sales to nokia  nortel and hughes network systems accounted for  and of total revenue  respectively 
there were no other customers that accounted for more than of our revenues 
the rapid and severe downturn for the united states economy and the telecommunications industry  beginning in late  has affected growth in demand for our customers products 
in addition to the deteriorating domestic economic environment  the worldwide telecommunications market is also experiencing reduced demand 
this decreased demand has led to reduced order forecasts from some of our customers 
in february  we announced lower than expected revenue outlook for  primarily due to reduced demand and inventory reduction at a major customer 
there can be no certainty as to the degree of the severity or duration of this economic downturn or the demand in the telecommunications industry 
we also cannot predict the extent and timing  if any  of the impact of the economic downturn in the united states and the worldwide downturn for the telecommunications industry on economies in asia  europe and other countries and geographic regions 
we also cannot predict whether any significant customer in prior periods will continue to be a significant customer in future periods 
we expect that a high percentage of our product sales will continue to be to a rather limited number of customers in the foreseeable future 
sales product sales were million  million  and million for   and respectively 
shipments to international customers accounted for  and of total product sales in  and  respectively 
additionally  many of our customers sell their products  which incorporate components and subsystems sold by us  outside the united states 

table of contents competition competition in the market for rf subsystems for broadband wireless access systems is intense 
in the markets for rf modules  transceivers and outdoor units  we primarily compete with  among others  the following merchant suppliers eyal microwave israel filtronics plc uk forem a division of allen telecom italy millitron inc korea mitel italy microelectronics technology  inc mti taiwan remec  inc usa teledyne technologies incorporated usa thales group sa france xytrans inc usa in addition to those companies listed above with whom we may compete directly  there are wireless systems integrators  for example  ericsson  who design and manufacture their own rf subsystems for use in their own broadband radio products 
to the extent wireless systems integrators presently  or may in the future  produce their own rf subsystems  we lose the opportunity to gain a customer and the related sales opportunities 
conversely  if they should decide to outsource their requirements  this may significantly expand the market available to endwave 
we are committed to providing superior product performance  logistical flexibility and manufacturing excellence  as we believe these factors are critical to our customers decision to purchase our products 
we believe that the cost structure of our products is competitive in each of our target markets 
many factors contribute to the final pricing of our products  including the costs for customer specific designs  the scale of production  and the logistical arrangements 
we believe we are well positioned to compete effectively in our chosen markets 
however  some of our current and potential competitors are substantially larger than us and have greater financial  technical  manufacturing and marketing resources 
if we were unable to compete successfully  our future operations and financial results would be harmed 
backlog our order backlog consists of a combination of standard purchase orders  annual purchase agreements and multi year frame agreements 
the large majority of our orders are multi year frame agreements with major commercial oems 
these frame agreements usually include an estimate of the expected annual quantities during the contract and include a logistics plan that provides for a monthly rolling forecast of usage from the customer 
these forecasts  however  are primarily for material and capacity planning purposes and are subject to significant changes from month to month and quarter to quarter 
the logistics plans generally allow the customers a high degree of flexibility in changing  rescheduling or canceling forecasted requirements 
because these customers are only required to take delivery of the firm portion of the forecasts  which is usually a month  more or less  they have the ability to significantly change forecasted delivery dates and quantities 
for these reasons we believe that backlog is not a reliable indicator of future revenue 
backlog includes all purchase orders and contracts for products with expected delivery dates through december  our backlog at march  was approximately million as compared to a backlog of million as of march  the decrease in backlog is attributable to the more conservative forecasts from our customers for requirements through the rest of there can be no assurance that the current backlog 
table of contents will necessarily lead to actual sales in any future period 
of our current backlog  approximately is attributable to orders received from nokia 
if we were to lose this customer or if orders by nokia or other customers were to decrease or be delayed  our operating results and financial condition would be harmed 
governmental regulations our products are incorporated into wireless communications systems that are subject to various united states regulations and similar laws and regulations adopted by regulatory authorities in other countries 
regulatory changes  including changes in allocation of available frequency spectrum  could significantly impact our operations by restricting development efforts by our customers  making obsolete current products or increasing the opportunity for additional competition 
changes in  or failure to comply with  applicable domestic and international regulations could have an adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  the increasing demand for wireless communication has exerted pressure on regulatory bodies worldwide to adopt new standards for these products and services  generally following extensive investigation of and deliberation over competing technologies 
the delays inherent in this governmental approval process have caused in the past  and may cause in the future  the cancellation  postponement or rescheduling of installation of communications systems by our customers  which in turn may negatively affect the sale of our products to those customers 
patents and intellectual property rights our success depends  in part  on our ability to protect our intellectual property 
we rely primarily on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary technologies and processes 
nevertheless  these measures may not be adequate to safeguard the proprietary technology underlying our products 
as of december   we had united states patents issued and foreign patents issued 
our issued patents include those relating to basic circuit and device designs  semiconductors  our proprietary flip chip circuit technology and various circuit and system designs 
in addition  we jointly hold seven patents with at t pertaining to sectorized communications systems and jointly hold one patent with superconducting supertechnologies  inc relating to satellite communications 
our issued patents expire between and of all our patents  we consider two patents relating to our flip chip circuit technology and a patent relating to our yig oscillator technology to be the most valuable 
with regard to our pending patent applications  no patents may be issued as a result of these or any future applications 
if they are issued  any patent claims allowed may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
in addition  any existing or future patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  and any right granted hereunder may not provide meaningful protection to us 
the failure of any patents to provide protection to our technology might make it easier for our competitors to offer similar products and use similar manufacturing techniques 
we generally enter into confidentiality and assignment of rights to inventions agreements with our employees  and confidentiality and non disclosure agreements with our strategic partners  and generally control access to and distribution of our documentation and other proprietary information 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization  develop similar technology independently or design around our patents 
in addition  effective patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited outside of the united states  europe and japan 
we may not be able to obtain any meaningful intellectual property protection in other countries and territories 
additionally  we may  for a variety of reasons  decide not to file for patent  copyright  or trademark protection outside of the united states 
we occasionally agree to incorporate a customer s or supplier s intellectual property into our designs  in which cases we have obligations with respect to the non use and non disclosure of that intellectual property 
we also license technology from velocium  a former wholly owned subsidiary of trw which is now an operating unit of northrop grumman space and mission systems 
there are no limitations on our rights to make  use or sell products we may develop in the future utilizing the technology licensed to us by velocium  provided that the products are for commercial customers and non satellite applications 

table of contents steps taken by us to prevent misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property or the intellectual property of our customers may not be successful 
moreover  litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others  including our customers 
litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources 
the wireless access industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights 
we have received  and may receive in the future  notices of claims of infringement of other parties proprietary rights 
in addition  the invalidity of our patents may be asserted or prosecuted against us 
furthermore  in a patent or trade secret action  we could be required to withdraw the product or products as to which infringement was claimed from the market or redesign products offered for sale or under development 
we have also at times agreed to indemnification obligations in favor of our customers and strategic partners that could be triggered upon an allegation or finding of our infringement of other parties proprietary rights 
these indemnification obligations would be triggered for reasons including our sale or supply to a customer or strategic partner of a product which was later discovered to infringe upon another party s proprietary rights 
irrespective of the validity or successful assertion of such claims we would likely incur significant costs and diversion of our resources with respect to the defense of such claims 
to address any potential claims or actions asserted against us  we may seek to obtain a license under a third party s intellectual property rights 
however  in such an instance  a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
research and development the goals of our research and development efforts are to reduce the cost and increase the functionality and performance of our products  while adapting them to the specifications required of our customers and of new markets for our products 
in addition  substantial efforts have been devoted to the development of efficient manufacturing methods necessary for competitive pricing and improved gross margins of our products  while maintaining high quality standards required by our customers 
other development efforts include expansion of existing product families and initiatives to combine products from our various complementary product lines to create additional functionality 
we believe that our future success will depend on our ability to continue to enhance and cost reduce our existing products  and to develop and introduce new products to maintain our technological leadership and meet a wider range of customer needs 
however  as a business we recognize the need to balance research and development spending with running a profitable business and have reduced our research effort accordingly 
our research and development and related engineering expenses were approximately million  million  and million in each of   and respectively 
the decrease in spending was primarily the result of staff reductions associated with matching our research and development spending to the current needs of the industry 
employees as of december   we had full time employees  including in manufacturing  in product and process engineering  in sales and marketing and in general and administrative 
our employees are not subject to any collective bargaining agreement with us and we believe that our relations with our employees are good

our failure to achieve profitability within the time frame that investors expect may cause the market price of our common stock to decline in the future 
we had net losses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
while we restructured during  revenues declined further which resulted in an additional restructuring in there is no guarantee that these restructuring actions will enable the company to achieve profitability in the future 
as a result of the merger with trw milliwave in march  we may be limited in our ability to utilize any of our net operating loss carryforwards generated prior to the merger to offset any future taxable income we may have 
until the last quarter of  our cost of product revenues has exceeded our product revenues due in part to the historically low volumes of products we have sold and our investments in manufacturing capacity 
we may be unable to maintain positive gross margins on product revenues or increase revenues sufficiently to achieve overall profitability 
the development of our technologies and products has required significant expenditures to hire and retain our research and development staff 
in addition  many of our major customers typically require high levels of product customization that generally requires the commitment of significant research and development resources 
we intend to continue to invest significantly in all areas  including research and development  to execute our business strategy 
as a result of these and other factors  we expect to continue to incur significant quarterly losses for at least the next several quarters 
if our revenues fail to grow at anticipated rates or if our expenses increase faster than we anticipate  our losses may increase and we may not become profitable 
because we have a limited operating history  you may have difficulty evaluating our business and future prospects 
we have only limited financial data that you can use to evaluate our future prospects in the broadband wireless access market 
furthermore  because our merger with trw milliwave occurred in march  we have a limited operating history as a combined company 
we depend upon a small number of customers  and the loss of any of them  or their failure to sell their systems  would limit our ability to generate revenues 
we depend  and expect to remain dependent  on a small number of wireless systems integrators for sales of our products 
if our customers reduce orders for our products  we could lose revenues and suffer damage to our reputation in the industry 
in february  we announced lower than expected revenue outlook for  
table of contents primarily due to reduced demand and inventory reduction at a major customer 
for the year ended december   sales to nokia  stratex networks  siemens and accounted for of total revenues 
for the year ended december   sales to nokia accounted for of total revenue 
for the year ended december   nokia  nortel and hughes network systems accounted for of total revenue 
our customers may not have or use the financial  marketing  technological and other resources necessary to ensure that their solutions will succeed in a marketplace characterized by rapid technological changes and intense competition 
for example  communications service providers may insist that wireless systems integrators provide extensive financing for the deployment of large broadband wireless access networks  and our customers may be unwilling or unable to provide the necessary financial resources 
if the wireless systems integrators that we supply were not successful in selling their broadband wireless access systems for any reason  our operating results would be harmed 
until recently  our cost of product revenues has exceeded our product revenues  and because we expect competitive conditions will force us to reduce prices in the future  we must achieve further cost reductions in order to maintain positive gross margins and become profitable 
as a combined company  including results on a pro forma combined basis prior to march   our cost of product revenues has exceeded our revenues and  accordingly  we have reported negative gross margins since inception until the fourth quarter of if we are not able to continue to reduce our per unit cost of product revenues to a sufficient degree  we will not become profitable 
we expect market conditions  particularly declining prices for competing broadband access solutions  will force us to reduce our prices in the future 
in order to reduce these costs  we must migrate our products to designs that require lower cost materials  improve our manufacturing efficiencies and successfully move production to low cost  off shore locations 
the combined effects of these actions may not be sufficient to achieve the cost reductions needed to maintain positive gross margins and to achieve profitability 
our operating results have historically fluctuated significantly and are likely to continue to do so in future periods 
these results may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  causing our stock price to fall 
our quarterly and annual operating results are difficult to predict and are likely to continue to fluctuate significantly from period to period 
it is likely that our operating results in one or more future quarters may be below the expectation of security analysts and investors 
in that event  the trading price of our common stock almost certainly would decline 
our operating results may fluctuate for many reasons  including  but may not limited to variations in the timing and size of  or cancellations or reductions of  customer orders and shipments  variations in the availability  cost and quality of components from our suppliers  particularly from our single source suppliers and suppliers of scarce components  competitive factors  including pricing  availability and demand for competing products  constraints on our manufacturing capacity  variability of the product development and sales cycle with our customers  variations in our manufacturing yields and other factors affecting our manufacturing costs  changes in our sales prices  changes in the mix of products with different gross margins  failure to meet milestones under any significant development contracts  obsolescence of our component inventories  
table of contents hiring and loss of personnel  particularly in manufacturing  research and development and sales and marketing  and product defect claims and associated warranty expenses 
we have a lengthy product development and sales cycle 
as a result  we must invest substantial financial and technical resources in a potential sale before we know whether the sale will occur 
if the sale does not occur  we may not have the opportunity to sell products to that customer until another generation of its system is developed 
our products are highly technical and accordingly our sales efforts involve a collaborative and iterative process with our customers to determine their specific requirements and design an appropriate solution 
depending on the product  the typical product development and sales cycle can take anywhere from three to twelve months  and we incur significant expenses as part of this process without any assurance of resulting revenues 
during the product development phase  our engineers typically work with the customer to define the product and design a prototype product for the customer to evaluate 
we generate revenues only if our product is selected for incorporation into a customer s system and that system is accepted in the marketplace 
if our product is not selected  or the customers development program is discontinued  we generally will not have an opportunity to sell our product to that customer until that customer develops a new generation of its system 
for example  in  we began the development of complete outdoor units for use in point to multipoint applications 
through we expended significant development funds on these products 
while the odus were incorporated into the customers system  there was little market demand for the end product at its price and performance level 
in the past  we have had difficulty meeting some of our major customers stated volume and cost requirements 
the length of our product development and sales cycle makes us particularly vulnerable to the loss of a significant customer or a significant reduction in orders by a customer because we may be unable to quickly replace the lost or reduced sales 
we may not be able to design our products as quickly as our customers require  which could cause us to lose sales and may harm our reputation 
existing and potential customers typically demand that we design products for them under difficult time constraints 
in the current market environment  the need to respond quickly is particularly important 
if we are unable to commit the necessary resources to complete a project for a potential customer within the requested timeframe  we may lose a potential sale 
our ability to design products within the time constraints demanded by a customer will depend on the number of product design professionals who are available to focus on that customer s project  and the availability of professionals with the requisite level of expertise may be limited 
each of our products is designed for a specific range of frequencies 
because different national governments license different portions of the frequency spectrum for the broadband wireless access market  and because communications service providers that use broadband wireless access systems license specific frequencies as they become available  we must adapt our products rapidly to use a wide range of different frequencies in order to remain competitive 
this may require the design of products at a number of different frequencies simultaneously 
this design process can be difficult and time consuming  could increase our costs and could cause delays in the delivery of products to our customers  which may harm our reputation and affect the timing of our revenue 
we may not be able to manufacture and deliver our products as quickly as our customers require  which could cause us to lose sales or incur penalties and would harm our reputation 
at times in the past  we have not produced products in the volume requested by our customers 
in the future  we may not be able to manufacture products and deliver them to our customers at the times  and in the volumes they require 
if we fail to manufacture and deliver products in a timely fashion  our reputation may be harmed  
table of contents we may jeopardize existing orders and lose potential future sales and we may be forced to pay penalties to our customers 
manufacturing delays and interruptions can occur for many reasons  including  but not limited to lack of sufficient capacity  the failure of a supplier to deliver needed components on a timely basis  or with acceptable quality  poor manufacturing yields  labor disputes  manufacturing personnel shortages  equipment failures  natural disasters  transportations disruptions  acts of terrorism  infrastructure failures  and political instability 
the manufacturing of our products is complex 
the yield  or percentage of products manufactured that conform to required specifications  can decrease for many reasons  including materials containing impurities  equipment not functioning in accordance with requirements or human error 
if our yield is lower than we expect  we may not be able to deliver products on time or at the required rate 
we rely heavily on our southeast asia off shore manufacturing partners to produce product for us 
if our partners are unable to produce product in sufficient quantities or with adequate quality or they choose to terminate our partnership arrangements  we may not be able to fulfill our production commitments to our customers  which could cause us to lose sales or incur penalties and would harm our reputation 
as part of our operating strategy  we partially or wholly outsource the assembly and test of some of our subassemblies and finished products to off shore partners located in southeast asia 
we plan to continue this arrangement as a key element of our operating strategy 
if these vendors do not provide us with high quality products and services in a timely manner  or if one or more of these vendors terminates its relationship with us  we may be unable to obtain satisfactory replacements to fulfill customer orders on a timely basis 
factors that could result in an interruption of supply from our off shore partners include  but may not be limited to changes in local regulations and government policy  currency fluctuations  lack of sufficient capacity  the failure of a supplier to deliver needed components on a timely basis  or with acceptable quality  poor manufacturing yields  labor disputes  manufacturing personnel shortages  equipment failures  natural disasters  transportation disruptions  acts of terrorism  
table of contents infrastructure failures  and political instability 
in the event of an interruption of supply from our offshore partners  our reputation may be harmed and we may lose potential future sales 
our reliance on velocium and other third party semiconductor providers to manufacture our gallium arsenide devices may cause a significant delay in our ability to fill orders and limit our ability to assure product quality and control costs 
we do not own or operate a semiconductor fabrication facility 
we currently rely on the semiconductor fabrication facilities of velocium  a former wholly owned subsidiary of trw which is now an operating unit of northrop grumman space and mission systems corp  and other third parties to manufacture substantially all of the gallium arsenide and other semiconductor devices incorporated in our products 
the loss of our relationship with any of these third parties or our use of their semiconductor fabrication facilities  particularly velocium s facility  and any resulting delay or reduction in the supply of gallium arsenide devices to us  will impact our ability to fulfill customer orders and could damage our relationships with our customers 
in connection with our merger with trw milliwave  we entered into a supply agreement with velocium for these devices and expect to obtain a substantial portion of our gallium arsenide devices from velocium in the foreseeable future 
the commercial terms of this agreement were renegotiated in march of and the agreement expires in december of we may not be able to negotiate an extension to this agreement on favorable terms  if at all 
we also may not be successful in forming alternative supply arrangements that provide us with a sufficient supply of gallium arsenide devices 
because there are limited numbers of third party semiconductor fabrication facilities that use the particular process technologies we select for our products and have sufficient capacity to meet our needs  using alternative or additional third party semiconductor fabrication facilities would require an extensive qualification process that could prevent or delay product shipments 
since we do not own or control any of these third party semiconductor suppliers  any change in the corporate structure or ownership of the corporations that own these foundries  could have a negative effect on our future relations and ability to negotiate favorable supply agreements 
our reliance on these third party suppliers involves several additional risks  including reduced control over manufacturing costs  delivery times  reliability and quality of the products incorporating these devices 
the fabrication of semiconductor devices is a complex and precise process 
there are many factors that can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous devices on a wafer to be nonfunctional including  but not limited to minute impurities  difficulties or inconsistencies in the fabrication process  defects in the masks used to print circuits on a semiconductor wafer  and wafer breakage 
we expect that our customers will continue to establish demanding specifications for quality  performance and reliability that must be met by our products 
our third party semiconductor fabrication facilities may not be able to achieve and maintain acceptable production yields in the future 
in the past  we have experienced delays in product shipments from our third party semiconductor fabrication facilities  which in turn delayed product shipments to our customers 
to the extent these suppliers suffer failures or defects  or delay deliveries to us  we could experience lost revenues  increased costs and delays in  cancellations or rescheduling of orders or shipments  any of which would harm our business 

table of contents because of the scarcity of some components and our dependence on single suppliers for some other components  we may be unable to obtain an adequate supply of components  or we may be required to pay higher prices or to purchase components of lesser quality 
we currently purchase a number of components  some from single source suppliers for which alternative sources may not be readily available  including  but not limited to electronic filters  circuit carrier assemblies  voltage control oscillators  semiconductor devices  yitrium iron garnet components  magnetic components  and frequency references 
any delay or interruption in the supply of these or other components could impair our ability to manufacture and deliver our products  harm our reputation and cause a reduction in our revenues 
in addition  any increase in the cost of the components that we use in our products could make our products less competitive and lower our margins 
our single source suppliers could enter into exclusive agreements with or be acquired by one of our competitors  increase their prices  refuse to sell their products to us  discontinue products or go out of business 
even to the extent alternative suppliers are available to us  identifying them and entering into arrangements with them is difficult and time consuming  and they may not meet our quality standards 
we may not be able to obtain sufficient quantities of required components on the same or substantially the same terms 
additionally  consolidations among our suppliers could result in other sole source suppliers for us in the future 
because we do not have long term commitments from many of our customers  we must estimate customer demand  and changes in our estimates would have negative effects on our inventory levels and revenues 
the rapid and severe downturn for the united states economy and the telecommunications industry  beginning in late  has affected growth in demand for our customers products 
in addition to the deteriorating domestic economic environment  the worldwide telecommunications market is experiencing reduced demand 
this decreased demand has led to fluctuating order forecasts from some of our customers  particularly those in the point to multipoint market 
there can be no certainty as to the degree of the severity or duration of this economic downturn or the demand in the telecommunications industry 
we also cannot predict the extent and timing  of the impact of the economic downturn in the united states and the worldwide downturn for the telecommunications industry on economies in asia  europe and other countries and geographic regions 
our sales are generally made on the basis of formal agreements and purchase orders  which may also be later modified or canceled by the customer  rather than firm long term purchase commitments 
we have historically been required to place firm orders for products and manufacturing equipment with our suppliers up to six months prior to the anticipated delivery date and  on occasion  prior to receiving an order for the product  based on our forecasts of customer demands 
our sales process requires us to make multiple demand forecast assumptions  each of which may introduce error into our estimates  causing excess inventory to accrue or a lack of manufacturing capacity when needed 
if we overestimate customer demand  we may allocate resources to manufacturing products that we may not be able to sell when we expect or at all 
as a result  we would have excess inventory  which would harm our financial results 
conversely  if we underestimate customer demand or if insufficient manufacturing capacity were available  we would lose revenue opportunities  lose market share and damage our customer relationships 
on occasion  we have been unable to adequately respond to unexpected increases in customer purchase orders and were unable to benefit from this increased demand 

table of contents because we may expand our manufacturing capacity in advance of demand  our manufacturing facilities may continue to be underutilized  which may harm our operating results 
as part of our strategy  we may expand our manufacturing capacity beyond the level required for our current sales 
as a result  our manufacturing facilities in the future may continue to be underutilized from time to time 
we expand our manufacturing capacity based on industry projections for future growth 
even if the broadband wireless industry experiences significant growth  we could still be unsuccessful in selling our products and growing along with the industry 
if demand for our products does not increase significantly  underutilization of our manufacturing facilities will likely continue and could harm our profitability and other operating results 
conversely  if we do not maintain adequate manufacturing capacity to meet demand for our products  we will lose opportunities for additional sales 
any failure to have sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet demand would harm our market share and operating results 
our products may contain component  manufacturing or design defects or may not meet our customers performance criteria  which could harm our customer relationships  industry reputation  revenues and profitability 
we have experienced manufacturing quality problems with our products in the past and may have similar problems in the future 
as a result of these problems  we have replaced components in some products  or replaced the product  in accordance with our product warranties 
our product warranties typically last one to three years 
as a result of component  manufacturing or design defects  we may be required to repair or replace a substantial number of products under our product warranties 
further  our customers may discover latent defects in our products that were not apparent when the warranty period expired 
these defects may cause repair or replacement expenses beyond the normal warranty  the loss of customers or damage to our reputation 
during  we provided million for warranty charges to cover repairing transceivers  sold to our largest customer  that have been identified to have a potentially faulty electronic component supplied by one our vendors 
while we believe the cause of the component s out of specification performance has been identified and corrected  we cannot guarantee that there will not be future specification performance problems with components supplied by vendors or that we will not take further warranty charges in future periods 
some of the contracts that we have entered into or assumed during acquisitions may contain clauses making endwave liable for consequential damages or other indirect costs that customers may incur 
these indirect costs may be significantly higher than the cost of repair or replacement of the endwave product 
we typically warrant our products for a period of one to three years  during which time we have the option to repair or replace any faulty products that are returned to us during the warranty period 
in addition  some contracts require that if there are hidden or latent defects  or defects that appear after the warranty period which could not be detected during normal inspection  we shall undertake any and all necessary corrective actions  including but not limited to redesigning the parts and replacing defective parts in the field 
if mutually agreed  repair or replacement of defective units can be undertaken by the customer  who we shall compensate for actual costs 
some radios incorporating our transceivers and manufactured and shipped by one of our customers are experiencing degraded performance after installation in the field 
the cause of the degradation has been identified to be a faulty electronic component supplied by one of our vendors 
we believe the cause of the component s out of specification performance has been identified and corrected 
although the transceiver products were delivered under a contract between endwave and the customer  the component supplier has agreed to compensate our customer for the indirect costs associated with the repair and replacement of the degraded radios and modules 
these indirect costs include the costs associated with removing and replacing the radios in 
table of contents the field as well as removing and replacing the transceiver module in the radio 
subsequently we have reached an agreement with the component supplier to share a portion of these repair and replacement costs 
during  we provided million for warranty charges to cover the actual repair of the transceivers containing faulty components 
while we believe that this reserve is adequate to cover our actual repair costs  it may not be adequate to fully cover all liability for our share of the indirect costs for which our supplier may be responsible 
any failure to appropriately protect our intellectual property could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to protect our intellectual property 
we rely primarily on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary technologies and processes 
nevertheless  these measures may not be adequate to safeguard the proprietary technology underlying our products 
with regard to our pending patent applications  no patents may be issued as a result of these or any future applications 
if they are issued  any patent claims allowed may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
in addition  any existing or future patents may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  and any right granted hereunder may not provide meaningful protection to us 
the failure of any patents to provide protection for our technology might make it easier for our competitors to offer similar products and use similar manufacturing techniques 
we generally enter into confidentiality and assignment of rights to inventions agreements with our employees  and confidentiality and non disclosure agreements with our strategic partners  and generally control access to and distribution of our documentation and other proprietary information 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization  develop similar technology independently or design around our patents 
in addition  effective patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable  limited  or unenforceable outside of the united states  europe and japan 
we may not be able to obtain any meaningful intellectual property protection in other countries and territories 
additionally  we may  for a variety of reasons  decide not to file for patent  copyright  or trademark protection outside of the united states or to discontinue support of existing patents  copyrights or trademarks within the united states or foreign countries 
we occasionally agree to incorporate a customer s or supplier s intellectual property into our designs  in which cases we have obligations with respect to the non use and non disclosure of that intellectual property 
we also license technology from velocium  a former wholly owned subsidiary which is now an operating unit of northrop grumman space mission systems 
there are no limitations on our rights to make  use or sell products we may develop in the future utilizing the technology licensed to us by velocium  provided that the products are for commercial customers and non satellite applications 
steps taken by us to prevent misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property or that of our customers may not be successful 
moreover  litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights  to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights of others  including our customers 
litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources 
as part of the strategy for the growth and expansion of our business  we may make additional acquisitions that could disrupt our business and severely harm our financial condition 
as part of our business strategy  we may invest in or acquire other businesses  technologies or assets  or enter into strategic relationships with third parties 
for future acquisitions  we may issue additional stock  incur debt  assume liabilities  incur amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets or incur large and immediate write offs 
with the exception of the integration of operations experienced following our merger with trw milliwave  our acquisition of certain assets of m a com from tyco electronics  our acquisition of the broadband assets of the fixed wireless division of signal technology corporation and our acquisition of 
table of contents certain assets of arcom  we have limited experience in integrating acquired businesses with our existing business 
our operation of any acquired businesses would involve numerous risks  including  but not limited to problems combining any purchased operations with our own operations  unanticipated costs  diversion of management s attention from our core business  adverse effects on existing business relationships with customers  risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and the potential loss of key employees  particularly those of the purchased organization 
we depend on our key personnel 
skilled personnel in our industry can be in short supply 
if we are unable to retain our current personnel and hire additional qualified personnel  our ability to develop and successfully market our products would be harmed 
we believe that our future success will depend upon our ability to attract  integrate and retain highly skilled managerial  sales and marketing  research and development and manufacturing personnel 
skilled personnel in our industry can be in short supply  so to attract and retain qualified personnel  we may be required to grant large option or other stock based incentive awards  which may be highly dilutive to other stockholders 
we may also be required to pay significant base salaries and cash bonuses to attract and retain skilled personnel  which could harm our operating results 
in addition  prospective employees  given the current volatility of the stock prices of technology focused companies  could perceive the stock option component of our compensation package overly risky and require more significant salary or cash bonus incentives for that reason 
we are particularly dependent on the continued employment of our senior management team and other key personnel 
if one or more members of our senior management team or other key personnel were unable or unwilling to continue in their present positions  these persons would be very difficult to replace  and our business could be seriously harmed 
we do not maintain key person life insurance policies 
our ability to increase our sales in international markets may be limited by risks related to international trade and marketing 
for the years ended december    and on a pro forma basis giving effect to our merger with trw milliwave for the year ended december    and  respectively  of our revenues were derived from sales invoiced and shipped to customers outside the united states 
in addition  some of our united states based customers may sell products  which incorporate our products  into international markets 
adverse international economic conditions or developments could in the future negatively affect our revenues and sales by our customers into these regions  which would impact our revenues 
in addition to the uncertainty as to our ability to maintain and expand our international presence  there are certain risks inherent in foreign operations  including  but not limited to changing regulations of various countries or regulating agencies effecting radio deployments and spectrum use  difficulties in complying with foreign laws and regulations and obtaining foreign governmental approvals and permits  delays in or prohibitions on exporting products resulting from export restrictions for our products and technologies  fluctuations in foreign currencies and the united states dollar  especially the euro  political and economic instability  
table of contents unforeseen effects of terrorism and terrorist activities  adverse tax consequences  and seasonal reductions in business activity 
in addition  foreign laws treat the protection of proprietary rights and intellectual property differently from laws in the united states and may not protect our proprietary rights and intellectual property to the same extent as united states laws 
we currently transact business only in us dollars 
in the future  economic or competitive situations may require us to conduct business in other currencies 
if this were to happen  we could become subject to currency exchange rate volatility  which could have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 
we conduct all of our current business in us dollars 
in the future  economic conditions or competitive pressures may require us to sell product in other currencies  especially the euro because of the high concentration of current and potential customers in countries that have adopted the euro 
if this were to occur and our contracts did not provide currency protection  we could experience significant currency exchange rate volatility 
that volatility could have serious impacts on the dollar value of our sales and subsequently on our operating results and financial condition 
compliance with current or future environmental laws and regulations could impose significant burdens on us  which could have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 
we use a small number of hazardous substances to produce our products 
if we fail to comply with present or future governmental regulations related to the use  storage  handling  discharge or disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing processes  we may have our manufacturing operations suspended and we may be assessed fines 
we may also be required to alter our manufacturing processes or even cease operations in locations where we cannot become compliant with applicable government regulation  which would result in significant costs 
governmental regulations could also require that we incur expensive remediation costs or other expenses to comply with environmental regulations 
we could also face future liabilities in civil actions for violations of environmental laws and regulations 
liability for cleanup under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act is joint and several 
consequently  if other parties that share responsibility with us for contamination at any site are unable to pay for their share of any damages or remediation  we may be held liable to pay for some or all of their share 
the broadband wireless access industry is new and its future is uncertain 
if significant demand for this technology does not develop  it will limit our ability to grow our revenues 
broadband wireless access technology is one of several possible ways to provide high speed infrastructure for transmission of voice  video and data 
however  the level of demand for high speed access will be at least partially dependent upon the development of end user applications that will require higher data rates  and their acceptance and use by the market 
if this demand will be significant and at what rate it will be created is not known at this time 
broadband wireless access technology is new and relatively unproven in the marketplace 
this technology may prove unsuitable for widespread commercial deployment  in which case it is unlikely we could generate enough revenues to obtain and sustain profitability 
many factors will influence the success or failure of broadband wireless access technology  including  but not limited to its capacity to handle growing demands for faster transmission of increasing amounts of video  voice and data  its cost effectiveness and performance compared to other forms of broadband access  the prices and performance of which continue to improve  
table of contents its reliability and security  whether the products can be manufactured in sufficient volume  its suitability for a sufficient number of geographic regions  the availability of sufficient frequencies for wireless communications service providers to deploy products at commercially reasonable rates  the availability of sufficient site locations for wireless communications service providers to install products at commercially reasonable rates  the development of user applications that will create the demand for higher capacity infrastructure for voice  video and data traffic  safety and environmental concerns regarding broadband wireless transmissions  and permission by domestic and international regulatory authorities to allow construction of new wireless systems 
many competing technologies serve our broadband access market  and if the broadband wireless access technologies upon which our products are based do not succeed as a solution for broadband access  we may not be able to sustain or grow our business 
providers of broadband wireless access solutions compete with providers of other high speed solutions  including digital subscriber lines  cable  fiber and other high speed wire  satellite and wireless technologies 
many of these alternative technologies use existing installed infrastructure and have achieved significantly greater market acceptance and penetration than broadband wireless access technologies 
moreover  current broadband wireless access technology has inherent technical limitations that may inhibit its widespread adoption in many areas  including the need for line of sight installation and reduced communication distance in bad weather 
in addition  the need for communications service providers to obtain the rights to install broadband wireless access equipment on rooftops and in other locations may inhibit its widespread adoption 
we expect broadband access technologies to face increasing competitive pressures from both current and future alternative technologies 
in light of these factors  many communications service providers may be reluctant to invest heavily in broadband wireless access solutions and  accordingly  the market for these solutions may fail to develop or may develop more slowly than we expect 
either outcome would limit our sales opportunities 
the broadband wireless access infrastructure equipment industry is intensely competitive  and our failure to compete effectively could reduce our revenues and margins 
competition in the market for rf subsystems for broadband wireless access systems is intense 
in addition  new entrants to the market can emerge and become significant competitors 
some new competitors have been formed by acquiring assets of failed or disbanded companies 
generally  these assets have been acquired at prices much lower than normally expected and this may give these new entrants a cost advantage 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in our industry are technical leadership and product performance  time to market in the design and manufacturing of products  manufacturing capability and scalable capacity  favorable access to semiconductor materials  price  the ability to migrate to low cost solutions  
table of contents product breadth  logistical flexibility  and carrier class quality 
there are also wireless systems integrators  for example  ericsson  that design and manufacture their own rf subsystems for internal use 
to the extent wireless systems integrators presently  or may in the future  produce their own rf subsystems  we lose the opportunity to gain a customer and the related sales opportunities 
conversely  if they should decide to outsource their requirements  we may have new opportunities 
many of our current and potential competitors are substantially larger than us and have greater financial  technical  manufacturing and marketing resources 
if we were unable to compete successfully  our future operations and financial results would be harmed 
for more information with reference to competition  please see the section entitled competition  above 
we must adapt to the rapid technological changes inherent in the broadband wireless access industry in order to succeed 
in order to succeed  we must improve current products and develop and introduce new products that are competitive in terms of price  performance and quality and that adequately address the changing requirements of wireless systems integrators  their customers and subscribers and emerging industry standards 
to accomplish this  we make substantial investments in the research and development of new products for and improvements to existing products 
if these investments do not result in competitive products that generate large volume orders  we may be unable to generate sufficient revenues to achieve profitability 
our research and development expenses were million and million for the years ended december  and respectively 
on a pro forma basis giving effect to our merger with trw milliwave  our research and development expenses were million in the year ended december  we intend to continue to incur substantial research and development and product development expenses 
it is possible that these investments will not generate product revenues sufficient to offset the original investment expense 
government regulation of the communications industry could limit the growth of the markets that we serve or could require costly alterations of our current or future products 
the markets that we serve are highly regulated 
communications service providers must obtain regulatory approvals to operate broadband wireless access networks within specified licensed bands of the frequency spectrum 
the fcc and foreign regulatory agencies have adopted regulations that impose stringent rf emissions standards on the communications industry 
changes to these regulations may require that we alter the performance of our products 
the enactment by governments of new laws or regulations or a change in the interpretation of existing regulations could adversely affect the market for our products 
although there is a present trend toward deregulation and current regulatory developments are favorable to the promotion of new and expanded wireless services  this could change at any time  and future regulatory changes could have a negative impact on us 
further  the increasing demand for wireless communications has exerted pressure on regulatory bodies worldwide to adopt new standards for broadband wireless access products  generally following extensive investigation and deliberation over competing technologies 
in the past  the delays inherent in this governmental approval process have caused  and in the future may cause  the cancellation  postponement or rescheduling of the installation of communications systems by our customers 
these delays could affect our ability to allocate our research and development resources effectively  cause our existing and potential customers to delay orders and otherwise harm our ability to generate revenues 

table of contents our industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights 
this could cause us to become involved in costly and lengthy litigation  which could subject us to liability  prevent us from selling our products or force us to redesign our products 
the wireless access industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights 
we have received and may receive in the future notices of claims of infringement of other parties proprietary rights 
for example  in the past we had inquiries that claim that some of our antenna technologies infringe upon a european patent 
in addition  the invalidity of our patents may be asserted or prosecuted against us 
furthermore  in a patent or trade secret action  we could be required to withdraw the product or products as to which the infringement was claimed from the market or redesign products offered for sale or under development 
we have also at times agreed to indemnification obligations in favor of our customers and strategic partners that could be triggered upon an allegation or finding of our infringement of other parties proprietary rights 
these indemnification obligations would be triggered for reasons including our sale or supply to a customer or strategic partner of a product which was later discovered to infringe upon another party s proprietary rights 
irrespective of the validity or successful assertion of intellectual property claims  we would likely incur significant costs and diversion of our resources with respect to the defense of any claims 
to address any potential claims or actions asserted against us  we may seek to obtain a license under a third party s intellectual property rights 
however  in such an instance  a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
the market price of our common stock is likely to fluctuate 
the price of our common stock has fluctuated widely since our initial public offering in october the market price of our common stock can fluctuate significantly for many reasons  including  but not limited to our financial performance or the performance of our competitors  technological innovations or other trends or changes in the broadband wireless access industry  successes or failures at significant product evaluations or site demonstrations  the introduction of new products by us or our competitors  the arrival or departure of key personnel  acquisitions  strategic alliances or joint ventures involving us or our competitors  changes in estimates of our performance or recommendations by securities analysts  decisions by major participants in the communications industry not to purchase products from us or to pursue alternative technologies  decisions by investors to de emphasize investment categories  groups or strategies that include our company or industry  market conditions in the industry  the financial markets and the economy as a whole  and because a small percentage of our stock is owned by public stockholders  it trades in low volumes which could cause volatility in our share price 
in addition  the stock market has recently experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  particularly after the september  terrorist attacks  including significant volatility in the market price of our common stock in particular 
these market fluctuations can be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies and the market prices for securities of technology companies have been especially volatile 
future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock  or the perception that such sales could occur  could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock 
additionally  future stock price volatility for our common stock could provoke the initiation of securities litigation  which may divert substantial management resources and have an adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our existing insurance coverage may not sufficiently cover all costs and claims that could arise out of any such securities litigation 
we anticipate that prices for our common stock will continue to be volatile 

table of contents our common stock has traded below one dollar and may be subject to de listing from the nasdaq national market 
the nasdaq has a per share minimum closing bid price requirement  pursuant to which our common stock could be de listed from the nasdaq national market if its closing bid price is below for consecutive trading days and does not subsequently trade above for consecutive trading days 
there can be no assurance that our closing bid price will be above the nasdaq requirements for the necessary time periods mandated by the nasdaq national market 
if we are unable to meet the nasdaq requirements to maintain listing on the nasdaq national market our common stock could trade on the nasdaq smallcap market  the otc bulletin board or in the pink sheets maintained by the national quotation bureau  inc such alternatives are generally considered to be less efficient markets  and our stock price  as well as the liquidity of our common stock  will be adversely impacted as a result 
our ability to achieve our business goals is substantially dependent on our access to sufficient capital 
if we do not have sufficient capital to fund our operations  we may be forced to discontinue product development  reduce our sales and marketing efforts and forego attractive business opportunities  and we may lose the ability to respond to competitive pressures 
it is possible we may need to raise additional funds in the future  and this additional financing may not be available to us on favorable terms  if at all 
we may also require additional capital to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products or obtain the right to use complementary technologies 
if we issue additional equity securities to raise funds  the ownership percentage of our existing stockholders would be reduced 
new investors may demand rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our common stock 
if we issue debt securities to raise funds  we may incur significant interest expense  which would harm our profitability 
the issuance of debt securities may also require us to agree to various restrictions typical of debt securities  including limitations on further borrowing and our right to pay dividends 
northrop grumman and our officers and directors control a large percentage of our common stock and together are able to control the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval 
as of march   directors and holders of five percent or more of our outstanding common stock beneficially owned approximately of our common stock 
of this percentage  northrop grumman alone beneficially owns approximately of our common stock 
as a result  our executive officers  directors and five percent stockholders as a group are able to effectively control all matters requiring approval of our stockholders  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
northrop grumman alone is able to significantly influence matters on which the stockholders vote 
this concentration of ownership may also delay  deter or prevent a change in control and may make some transactions more difficult or impossible to complete without the support of these stockholders  even if the transaction is favorable to our stockholders 
in addition  because of their ownership of our common stock  these stockholders are in a position to significantly affect our corporate actions in a manner that could conflict with the interests of our public stockholders 
our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and arrangements with executive officers contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control 
we are subject to certain delaware anti takeover laws by virtue of our status as a delaware corporation 
these laws prevent us from engaging in a merger or sale of more than of our assets with any stockholder  including all affiliates and associates of any stockholder  who owns or more of our outstanding voting stock  for three years following the date that the stockholder acquired or more of our voting stock unless the board of directors approved the business combination or the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder  or upon consummation of the transaction which resulted in the stockholder becoming an 
table of contents interested stockholder  the interested stockholder owned at least of our voting stock of the corporation  or the business combination is approved by our board of directors and authorized by least of our outstanding voting stock not owned by the interested stockholder 
a corporation may opt out of the delaware anti takeover laws in its charter documents  however we have not chosen to do so 
additionally  our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include a number of provisions that may deter or impede hostile takeovers or changes of control of management  including a staggered board of directors  the elimination of the ability of our stockholders to act by written consent  discretionary authority given to our board of directors as to the issuance of preferred stock  and indemnification rights for our directors and executive officers 
in addition  we have an officer retention plan that provides for the acceleration of vesting of a percentage of the stock options granted to our officers under certain conditions 
under this plan  an unvested portion of each officer s stock options will become vested and  in addition  severance benefits will be paid to the officer  if we undergo a change in control transaction or the officer is terminated without cause 
this plan may make us a less attractive acquisition target or may reduce the amount a potential acquiror may otherwise be willing to pay for our company 
item properties our principal executive offices are located in sunnyvale  california  where we lease approximately  square feet  which encompasses our headquarters and research and development facilities  under a lease expiring june approximately  square feet of this facility is subleased to an unrelated entity  under an agreement that will expire february in march  we terminated a lease for approximately  square feet  in sunnyvale  california 
we lease approximately  square feet in andover  massachusetts for our northeast operations under a lease expiring september we also lease approximately  square feet in torrance  california for business development purposes  under a lease expiring in march we own two buildings comprising approximately  square feet on eight acres of land in diamond springs  california  which we use primarily for manufacturing purposes

as of december   net proceeds remaining continue to be invested in short term  interest bearing investment grade securities and cash and cash equivalents pending our usage for the above mentioned purposes 
we have never declared a dividend or paid any cash dividends on our common stock

on march   we merged with trw milliwave 
we were the surviving corporation in the merger and trw milliwave ceased to exist as a separate legal entity 
however  because we issued more than half of our 
table of contents outstanding capital stock to trw in exchange for all outstanding shares in trw milliwave  trw milliwave is treated as the acquiring company for accounting purposes 
as a result  our financial statements prior to the date of the merger are those of trw milliwave 
net loss per share is computed below in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas statement no 
 earnings per share sfas and sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
pursuant to sfas and sab  basic net loss per share is computed by dividing the net loss applicable to common stockholders for the period by the weighted average numbers of shares of common stock outstanding during the period 
in march  in connection with the merger  trw received convertible preferred stock in exchange for all outstanding shares of the common stock of trw milliwave 
giving effect to the merger retroactive to march  no shares of common stock are outstanding 
accordingly  net loss per share data has not been presented for periods prior to march the net loss applicable to common stockholders subsequent to the merger represents the net loss incurred after march  including the charge for purchased in process research and development 
the net loss for the year ended december  was million  less the net loss for the three months ended march  of million resulting in a net loss applicable to common stockholders subsequent to the merger in march of million 
the shares used in computing net loss per share are the weighted average shares outstanding since the merger 
since we incurred losses for all periods presented  the convertible preferred stock would be anti dilutive and accordingly  diluted net loss per share is the same as basic net loss per share 
all per share amounts from all periods presented have been restated to reflect the for reverse stock split approved by our board of directors on june  year ended december  in thousands  except per share data revenue cost of product revenues other operating expenses loss from operations net loss net loss applicable to common stockholders subsequent to the merger basic and diluted net loss per share cash dividends financial position cash and restricted cash short term investments total assets long term obligations  less current portion cash flow from operations item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained in this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  including statements regarding our expectations  beliefs  intentions or strategies regarding the future 
the following discussion should be read together with our financial statements and notes to those financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
all forward looking statements included in this document are based on information available to us on the date hereof  and we assume no obligation to update any 
table of contents such forward looking statements 
our actual results could differ materially from those described in our forward looking statements 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements 
in the past  our operating results have fluctuated and are likely to continue to fluctuate in the future 
all per share amounts for all periods have been adjusted to reflect the for reverse stock split approved by our board of directors on june  overview our revenues consist of product revenues and  to a much lesser extent  development fees 
product revenues are generated through sales of our custom and standard rf subsystem products to wireless systems integrators and original equipment manufacturers and are recognized when title passes  which is upon product shipment or when withdrawn from a consignment location 
we sell our products through our direct sales force and through our network of independent sales representatives 
development fees are generated by developing product prototypes and custom products pursuant to development agreements that provide for payment of a portion of our research and development or other expenses 
any up front development fees paid under a development contract are recognized ratably over the expected term of the contract or when specific milestones are achieved  except that in no event are revenues recognized prior to becoming billable under the terms of the contract 
these agreements  which we enter into with key customers from time to time  are for specific projects and are non recurring 
we depend  and expect to remain dependent  on a small number of wireless systems integrators for sales of our products 
if our customers reduce orders for our products  we could lose revenues and suffer damage to our reputation in the industry 
for the years ended december   and  total sales to nokia accounted for  and of total revenue  respectively 
the rapid and severe downturn for the united states economy and the telecommunications industry  beginning in late  has affected growth in demand for our customers products 
in addition to the deteriorating domestic economic environment  the worldwide telecommunications market is experiencing continued reduced demand 
this decreased demand has led to fluctuating order forecasts from some of our customers 
there can be no certainty as to the degree of the severity or duration of this economic downturn or the demand in the telecommunications industry 
we also cannot predict the extent and timing of the impact of the economic downturn in the united states and the worldwide downturn for the telecommunications industry on economies in asia  europe and other countries and geographic regions 
as recent as the first quarter of  order demand from our largest customer continues to fluctuate as they are experiencing the impact of the downturn in the telecommunications market 
on march   we merged with trw milliwave  a former wholly owned subsidiary of trw 
we were the surviving corporation in the merger and trw milliwave ceased to exist as a separate legal entity 
however  because we issued more than half of our outstanding shares of capital stock to trw in exchange for all outstanding shares of trw milliwave  trw milliwave was treated as the acquiring company for accounting purposes 
however  when we refer to our business or other corporate activities prior to march   the date of the merger  we are generally referring to our business and corporate activities prior to our merger with trw milliwave unless otherwise specified 
when we refer to our results on a pro forma basis  we have combined the historical statements of operations for trw milliwave and endgate as discussed in note to the financial statements 
our merger with trw milliwave was accomplished through a tax free reorganization under the internal revenue code 
as such  the respective tax bases in assets and liabilities carried over to the combined company with no step up in basis 
therefore  the amortization and impairment charge related to intangible assets resulting from the merger  including goodwill  is not deductible for tax purposes 
since inception  we have incurred net losses and therefore generated significant net operating loss carryforwards 
historically  these carryforwards were not reflected on our balance sheet as an asset because they were fully reserved due to uncertainty about our 
table of contents ability to utilize these loss carryforwards 
our merger with trw milliwave imposed limitations on our ability to utilize these pre existing net operating loss carryforwards 
generally accepted accounting principles require that deferred tax liabilities be recorded for identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination accounted for as a purchase 
the deferred tax asset related to net operating loss carryforwards is greater than the deferred tax liabilities related to the identifiable intangible assets acquired 
a valuation allowance has been provided to eliminate the net deferred tax asset because ultimate realization is uncertain 
because trw milliwave was a wholly owned subsidiary of trw  and therefore part of the consolidated trw tax return prior to merging with us  trw was able to utilize trw milliwave s net operating losses in the consolidated income tax return of trw for periods prior to march  leaving trw milliwave with no net operating loss carryforwards 
on april   we completed the acquisition of certain assets from tyco electronics related to their m a com subsidiary s broadband wireless business 
we have used the acquired net assets to expand our customer base and product offerings 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the total consideration paid by the company in the acquisition was million in cash and the issuance of  shares of our common stock valued at million  liabilities assumed of approximately million and acquisition expenses of approximately on september   we acquired the broadband assets of the fixed wireless division of signal technology corporation for cash of million  inclusive of acquisition costs 
the assets acquired were inventory  equipment  product designs and related intellectual property  and customer contracts 
in addition  we hired former employees of signal technology corporation to support the ongoing business with existing customers 
we review long lived assets  including intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its fair value 
in the first quarter of  we determined that impairment indicators were present and therefore evaluated the carrying value of the goodwill and other intangible assets 
the evaluation was based on a cash flow forecast for five years ending march   and discounted at the rate of  which represented our weighted average cost of capital 
as a result of the evaluation  we concluded that unamortized goodwill and other intangible assets of million were impaired and accordingly  this amount was charged to operations in the first quarter of we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas no 
on january  the following pro forma information reflects the impact on net loss and net loss per share assuming the adoption of sfas no 
had occurred on january  in thousands pro forma reported net loss amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives additional loss due to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives pro forma net loss basic and diluted net loss per share reported net loss adjustment related to amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives additional loss due to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives pro forma net loss per share in december  we divested our antenna product division  and effectively ceased all operations relating to antenna development and manufacturing 
the net loss on this transaction was insignificant 
as part of the sale  
table of contents endwave will receive royalties for the next ten years on any future sales of endwave developed intellectual property 
the revenues associated with the antenna products for the year ended december  were approximately million 
to date  there have been no antenna royalties received 
in january  we announced a plan to repurchase up to an aggregate of  shares of our stock 
the repurchases will be made from time to time on the open market at prevailing market prices or in negotiated transactions off the market 
during  we repurchased  shares for approximately in march  we executed a renewal to our master supply agreement with velocium  a former wholly owned subsidiary of trw which is now an operating unit of northrop grumman space and missions systems corp 
through december  this renewal expands our access to velocium s custom wafer processing services  to state of the art gallium arsenide technologies  products operating at lower frequency bands for wireless infrastructure applications  indium phosphide products for advanced applications and guaranteed pricing and purchase commitments 
during the first quarter of  we commenced the implementation of an on site inventory management program with nokia 
this program provides storage of endwave finished goods at nokia s factory and allows nokia to draw against this inventory based on their manufacturing needs 
revenue is recognized as nokia draws the inventory from this stocking location 
in june  we announced that we had entered into a contract with lockheed martin missiles and fire control company to design the rf receiver unit for the comanche radar system used in the boeing rah comanche helicopter 
the contract with lockheed martin  a primary sub contractor to the boeing company for the comanche radar program  calls for us to design the radar rf receiver unit  and to manufacture and deliver prototype and evaluation units that will be used in qualification trials within the complete radar system 
on february   we announced the acquisition of certain broadband assets of arcom wireless inc  a subsidiary of dover corporation for  in cash 
the acquisition was structured as an asset purchase  and included a transceiver design  equipment and intellectual property licenses required to manufacture and supply a ghz integrated transceiver product to an existing customer 
we expect to begin shipping product in the third quarter of from the acquired designs 
restructuring plans on january   our board of directors approved a restructuring plan related to our transition of all manufacturing activities from our sunnyvale  california facility to our diamond springs  california manufacturing facility 
some of the factors that led to the decision to restructure include a decline in the telecommunications market  our decision to exit the point to multipoint market and long term excess capacity 
the consolidation of manufacturing operations to our diamond springs  california facility was substantially completed in the second quarter of in the first quarter of  we recorded restructuring costs of million in conjunction with the restructuring plan 
these costs related primarily to severance and benefits of million and non cash costs of million for impairment of fixed assets 
in addition  the company recognized a million charge for excess and obsolete inventory related primarily to inventory for the point to multipoint market that the company decided to exit 
the inventory charge was recorded as a cost of product revenues in our statement of operations 
an additional restructuring charge of million primarily related to retention bonuses and benefits and million for excess leased facilities in sunnyvale  california was recognized in the last three quarters of 
table of contents also in the fourth quarter  we reached an agreement to settle its claims in relation to the inventory it had acquired to fulfill sales orders with one of our point to multipoint customers that was charged off in the first quarter 
this settlement resulted in a million benefit that was recorded as a reduction to cost of product revenues in the company s statement of operations 
following is a summary of activity in the restructuring reserve amounts in thousands severance benefits fixed asset impairment lease cancellations and other exit costs total march restructuring charge settlement of contractual obligations non cash amount additions cash payments december  balance settlement of contractual obligations non cash amount cash payments adjustments december  as a result of a continued decline in overall economic conditions and further reductions in capital spending by telecommunications service providers  on february   we announced an additional restructuring plan designed to reduce operating expenses in order to further align resources with long term growth opportunities 
during the first quarter of  we recorded a restructuring charge of million the first quarter plan  the components of which were million for severance payments   for lease cancellations  and a non cash charge of million for excess equipment  offset by a  adjustment for excess severance benefits 
during the twelve months ended december   we eliminated positions and made cash payments of million under the first quarter plan

critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates general management s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to product returns  bad debts  excess and obsolete inventories  investment carrying value  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  excess component order cancellation costs  restructuring  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies contain the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company s customers are primarily wireless systems integrators and equipment manufacturers who integrate the company s products into their products 
the company recognizes product revenue at the time title passes  which is upon product shipment or when withdrawn from a consignment location 
revenues related to product sales are recognized in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  when persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
there are no typically significant acceptance requirements or post shipment obligations on the part of endwave 
the company recognizes development fees ratably over the estimated term of the development period or when specific milestones are achieved 
up front fees  if any  associated with development 
table of contents agreements are recognized over the estimated development and production period 
in no event are revenues recognized prior to becoming payable by the customer 
the costs incurred under these agreements are included in research and development expenses 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we provide an allowance for specific customer accounts where collection is doubtful and also provide a general allowance for other accounts based on historical collection and write off experience 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
warranty reserve we provide for the estimated cost of product warranty at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  and revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
we have experienced manufacturing quality problems with our products in the past and may have similar problems in the future 
as a result of these problems  we have replaced components in some products  or replaced the product  in accordance with our product warranties 
our product warranties typically last one to three years 
as a result of component  manufacturing or design defects  we may be required to repair or replace a substantial number of products under our product warranties 
further  our customers may discover latent defects in our products that were not apparent when the warranty period expired 
these defects may cause repair or replacement expenses beyond the normal warranty  the loss of customers or damage to our reputation 
during  some radios incorporating our transceivers and manufactured and shipped by one of our customers are experiencing degraded performance after installation in the field 
the cause of the degradation has been identified to be a faulty electronic component supplied by one of our vendors 
we believe the cause of the component s out of specification performance has been identified and corrected 
although the transceiver products were delivered under a contract between endwave and the customer  the component supplier has agreed to compensate our customer for the indirect costs associated with the repair and replacement of the degraded radios and modules 
these indirect costs include the costs associated with removing and replacing the radios in the field as well as removing and replacing the transceiver module in the radio 
subsequently we have reached an agreement with the component supplier to share a portion of these repair and replacement costs 
during  we provided million for warranty charges to cover the actual repair of the transceivers containing faulty components 
while we believe that this reserve is adequate to cover our actual repair costs  it may not be adequate to fully cover all liability for our share of the indirect costs for which our component supplier may ultimately be responsible to our customers 
inventory valuation we report our inventory at the lower of cost or market 
in establishing the appropriate provisions for inventory  management must make estimates about the future customer demand for our products  taking into account both general economic conditions and growth prospects within our customers ultimate marketplace and the market acceptance of our current and pending products 
these judgments must be made in the context of our customers shifting technology and product needs 
a misinterpretation or misunderstanding of these conditions 
table of contents or uncertainty in the future outlook of our industry or the economy  or other failure to estimate correctly  could result in inventory losses in excess of the provisions determined to be appropriate as of the balance sheet date 
investment in securities we consider all highly liquid investments with a maturity of days or less when purchased to be cash equivalents 
all other investments which have maturities between days and a year are classified as short term investments and are carried at market 
our cash equivalents and investments are comprised principally of money market funds  commercial paper and corporate bonds 
investments in commercial paper corporate bonds are in companies with excellent ratings and are considered high quality at the time of the initial investment 
in the event the financial condition of the companies issuing these securities deteriorates  the value of these assets would need to be evaluated and may result in charges to reflect impairment of market value 
long lived assets we periodically review our property  plant and equipment for possible impairment whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be fully recoverable 
assumptions and estimates used in the evaluation of impairment may affect the carrying value of long lived assets  which could result in impairment charges in future periods 
significant assumptions and estimates include the projected cash flows based upon estimated revenue and expense growth rates and the discount rate applied to expected cash flows 
in addition  our depreciation and amortization policies reflect judgments on the estimated useful lives of assets 
restructuring charges during and  we recorded significant charges in connection with our restructuring programs 
these reserves include estimates pertaining to employee separation costs  the settlement of contractual obligations and the estimated net proceeds for property and equipment to be disposed of resulting from our actions 
during  we recorded additional  significant charges with our restructuring plans in march and september 
these reserves include estimates pertaining to employee separation costs  the settlement of contractual obligations and the estimated net proceeds for property and equipment to be disposed of resulting from our actions 
these plans will be substantially completed as of december  stock based compensation as permitted by the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  we apply accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations in accounting for our stock option plans and stock purchase plan 
note of the notes to the financial statements describes the plans we operate  and note of the notes to the financial statements contains a summary of the pro forma effects reported to new loss and net loss per share if we elected to recognize compensation cost based on the fair value of the options granted at the grant date  as prescribed by sfas deferred taxes we currently have significant deferred tax assets  which are subject to periodic recoverability assessments 
realization of our deferred tax assets is principally dependent upon our achievement of projected future taxable income 
because we have not generated profits since inception  we have established a valuation allowance for the full amount of the deferred tax asset 
if our profitability changes  we will reassess the value of these assets and make adjustments as required 

table of contents results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues revenues in were million  a decrease from  and were comprised of product revenues and development fees 
assuming the overall market condition does not improve  we expect no material increase in revenues in product revenues were million in  a decrease from million in the decrease reflects a slow down in the global economy  and further tightening of financial markets in the telecommunication industry  which has reduced our customers demand for our products 
more specifically  we experienced a decrease in the number of transceiver products sold to nokia and allgon microwave partially offset by increased shipments to stratex networks and lockheed martin 
we generate development fees by developing product prototypes and custom products pursuant to development agreements that provide for payment of a portion of our research and development or other expenses 
development fees were  in  a decrease from  in the decrease in development fees is attributable to less development of custom designed products 
we are engaging with customers for development of new product prototypes and seek to generate future development fees  particularly with defense and government related contracts  however  we do not foresee significant development fees in the near term 
cost and expenses cost of product revenues 
cost of product revenues consists primarily of the costs of direct materials and labor utilized to assemble and test our products  equipment depreciation  costs associated with procurement  production control  quality assurance  and manufacturing engineering  costs associated with maintaining our manufacturing facilities  transition costs to support our offshore manufacturing strategy and  costs associated with warranty returns 
cost of product revenues was million in  a decrease from million in the improvement is attributable to restructuring actions over the past months  cost controls within the manufacturing process  including consolidation of our manufacturing sites  introduction of lower cost products and elimination of excess overhead and capacity and lower product shipments during we expect further improvements in cost of product revenues as a result of our cost reduction activities 
in addition  we recorded charges in for excess and obsolete inventory of million associated with the decline in demand of customers in the point to multipoint market  and a special warranty charge of million to cover the recall and repair of transceivers sold to our largest customer  that have been identified to have a potentially faulty electronic component supplied by one of our vendors 
at the present time  we expect our reserves for this special warranty charge to be adequate and do not foresee any additional reserve requirements 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses in were million  a decrease from million in the decrease was primarily attributable to restructuring our engineering team in line with business opportunities as well as reduced development cost for new products

in the first quarter of  we determined we would be unable to successfully negotiate a new contract with nortel and were informed by hughes that orders for the following few quarters would be effectively eliminated 
hughes indicated that orders may be resumed late in  however  we did not expect this would happen as it believed hughes had excess quantities already on hand and the market for their product was weakening 
sales to hughes and nortel represented approximately of sales 
also in the first quarter  we decided to consolidate manufacturing in the diamond springs  california facility 
this plan resulted in a majority of prior endgate employees being terminated 
in addition  during the first quarter  we came to believe that the downturn in the industry would be significantly longer than originally expected as a result of earnings warnings of both customers and peers 
we considered these events to be indicators of potential impairment and we evaluated the carrying value of our long lived assets 
our forecast of future cash flows indicated that our long lived assets were impaired 
we estimated the fair value of long lived assets by discounting the cash flow forecast using a discount rate of  which represented our weighted average cost of

 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  that is applicable to financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  this standard provides a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of and significantly changes the criteria that would have to be met to classify an asset as held for sale 
classification as held for sale is an important distinction since such assets are not depreciated and are stated at the lower of fair value and carrying amount 
this standard also requires expected future operating losses from discontinued operations to be recorded in the period s in which the losses are incurred  rather than as of the measurement date as presently required

 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred as opposed to eitf issue no 
that required a liability for an exit cost to be recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
the provisions of this statement are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   with early application encouraged 
the principal difference between statement and issue relates to statement s requirements for recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity 
the company does not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations

fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin is effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  the company does not believe it has any investments in variable interest entities and therefore  does not anticipate any impact upon the adoption of this interpretation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk disclosure about market risk the following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates  equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
this amount consists substantially of highly liquid investments with an original maturity at the date of purchase of less than days 
in addition  we have short term investments of million  which consist primarily of highly liquid investment grade commercial paper and government securities 
all of these amounts are exposed to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates should increase 
a hypothetical increase in market interest rates by percent from december  would cause the fair value of these instruments to decline by an insignificant amount 
due to the short duration of these investments  a change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce interest income 
we do not have any material equity investments 
therefore  we do not currently have any direct equity price risks 
currently  all sales to international customers are denominated in united states dollars and  accordingly we are not exposed to foreign currency rate risks in connection with these sales 
however  a strengthening dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets and thereby lead to a decrease in revenues attributable to international customers
