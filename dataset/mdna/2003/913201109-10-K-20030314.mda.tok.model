item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the preceding selected consolidated financial and operating information 
additionally  our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  as well as other data included in this document  should be read and analyzed in combination with the analysis below 
general matrix bancorp was formed in june when the founding shareholders of matrix financial and united financial  now known as matrix capital markets  two of our subsidiaries  exchanged all of their outstanding capital stock for shares of our stock in a series of transactions that were each accounted for as a pooling of interests 
in september  we acquired dona ana savings and loan association  fsb  which was subsequently renamed matrix capital bank 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
we formed matrix asset management  formerly united special services  in june and united capital markets in december in february  we acquired the vintage group whose primary subsidiary is sterling trust in a pooling of interests and  accordingly  no goodwill was recorded and our consolidated financial statements for the prior periods were restated 
additionally  we acquired abs in march the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
we entered into our joint venture  matrix settlement clearance services  in september of on august   we sold the stock of united capital markets to one of the officers of that company 
on august   matrix financial  our mortgage banking operation  became an operating subsidiary of matrix bank 
on october   first matrix  our broker dealer operation  became an operating subsidiary of matrix capital markets 
the principal components of our revenues consist of o net interest income recorded by matrix bank  matrix financial and abs school services  o loan origination fees generated by matrix financial and  to a lesser extent  matrix bank  o brokerage and consulting fees generated by matrix capital markets and first matrix  o disposition services fees generated by matrix asset management  o gains on sales of mortgage loans and mortgage servicing rights generated by matrix bank and matrix financial  o loan administration fees generated by matrix financial  o trust service fees generated by sterling trust  and o school service fees generated by abs 
our results of operations are influenced by changes in interest rates and the effect of these changes on our interest margins  the volume of loan originations  mortgage loan prepayments and the value of mortgage servicing portfolios 
our fee based businesses are effected to a lesser extent by interest rates and more by competition and general market conditions 
sale of wholesale production platform in february  we entered into an agreement to sell our wholesale mortgage origination platform at matrix financial 
see item business sale of wholesale production platform 
as of the initial sale date and during the transition period  due to our continuing involvement  we will continue to account for the operations of the platform 
the effective sale date for accounting purposes will be the final sale date which is anticipated to be approximately six months after the initial closing date 
we were concerned that over an extended period of time we would find it difficult to compete in the highly competitive industry that generally operates on high volume and low margins 
based on the size of our wholesale production platform  we were required to commit a significant percentage of our capital to a line of business that is fairly cyclical and the earnings were difficult for us to estimate 
the decision to sell the platform will allow us to reduce our operational risks and costs associated with the origination platform 
we intend to reinvest the liquidity that will be created from the sale into predominately adjustable rate loans  sba loans and potentially mortgage backed securities 
to the extent that we are not able to reinvest the liquidity in a timely manner  we will experience a decrease in our net interest income 
initially  the liquidity will be used to pay down borrowings from the fhlb or brokered certificates of deposit 
comparison of results of operations for fiscal years and net income loss 
a net loss of million for the fiscal year was recognized  a million decrease to the net income of million for fiscal year on a basic and diluted per share basis  net loss was for the fiscal year as compared to net income of per diluted share for fiscal year the decreases in net income  earnings per share and return on average equity were caused primarily by million  net pre tax  non cash impairment charges against the value of the mortgage servicing rights and related advances  million write off of goodwill balances at abs and a  loss on subleasing of office space 
for a further discussion of the goodwill write off  see recent accounting pronouncements regarding sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
net interest income 
net interest income before provision for loan and valuation losses increased million to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year our net interest margin increased basis points equivalent to percentage points to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december   and interest rate spread increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in net interest income before provision for loan valuation losses was primarily due to a basis point decrease in the cost of our interest bearing liabilities  driven by decreases in interest rates  which have significantly impacted the rates paid by matrix bank for fhlb borrowings and certificates of deposit 
the cost of fhlb borrowings decreased basis points to for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  the cost of certificates of deposit decreased basis points to for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  the interest rate on short term borrowings fluctuates with the federal funds rate  which remain at year lows 
the decrease in our cost of interest bearing liabilities was partially offset by a decrease in the yield earned on our average loan portfolio to for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  the increase was also due to a million increase in our average noninterest bearing deposits between the two comparable years  offset by a slight decrease in our average interest earning assets to billion for the year ended december  as compared to billion for the year ended december  for a tabular presentation of the changes in net interest income due to changes in volume of interest earning assets and changes in interest rates  see analysis of changes in net interest income due to changes in interest rates and volumes 
provision for loan and valuation losses 
the provision for loan and valuation losses decreased  or  to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year this decrease was attributable to lower levels of reserves recorded at matrix bank and matrix financial due to improvements in nonaccrual loans  offset by higher levels of reserves recorded at abs due to higher loan losses versus levels in for a discussion of the components of the allowance for loan losses  see asset and liability management analysis of allowance for loan and valuation losses 
for a discussion on the allowance as it relates to nonperforming assets  see asset and liability management nonperforming assets 
loan administration 
loan administration income represents service fees earned from servicing loans for various investors  which are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal balance plus late fees and other ancillary charges  as well as gains on sales of repurchased fha and va loans 
loan administration fees increased million to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year the increase includes gains on sale of previously repurchased fha and va loans from our mortgage servicing rights portfolio of for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  gains on sale of previously repurchased fha and va loans relate to delinquent loans which are purchased out of loan pools of which matrix financial acts as servicer and then re sells into the secondary market 
loan service fees are also affected by factors that include the size of our residential mortgage loan servicing portfolio  the servicing spread  the timing of payment collections and the amount of ancillary fees received 
our mortgage loan servicing portfolio increased slightly to an average balance of billion for fiscal year as compared to an average balance of billion for fiscal year there was a decrease in the average service fee including all ancillary income to for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december   excluding the gain noted above  and fiscal excludes a  transition adjustment  as well as  of subservicing income from a portfolio sold in not transferred until the decrease in the service fees was due to matrix financial s decision in the third quarter of to begin to sell the majority of its newly originated servicing under an assignment of trade contract 
in the near term  matrix financial anticipates it will continue to sell the majority of its newly originated servicing 
as a result  matrix financial anticipates loan administration fees to decrease as its servicing portfolio decreases through normal prepayments 
see item business sale of wholesale production platform 
loan origination 
loan origination income includes all mortgage loan fees  secondary marketing activity on new loan originations and servicing release premiums on new originations sold  net of origination costs 
loan origination income increased slightly to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year the consistency in loan origination income resulted from a combination of an increase in our wholesale origination to billion for the year ended december  as compared to billion for the year ended december   an increase in sales of our wholesale production to billion for the year ended december  as compared to billion for the year ended december   offset by the effects of a decrease in net income spread to basis points for the year ended december  as compared to basis points for the year ended december  the decrease in the net income spread is a result of the ineffectiveness in the loan origination hedging program primarily during the year ended december  the company closed fewer loans than anticipated  and thus had committed to sell more loans than originated 
the company therefore incurred costs on the extra hedge coverage 
the higher than anticipated hedge ineffectiveness was primarily due to the level of refinancing on which it is more difficult to predict the probability of closure 
included in prior year income was million from the gain on sale of guaranteed portions of newly originated or purchased sba loans as compared to  in the current year 
see item business sale of wholesale production platform 
brokerage fees 
brokerage fees represent income earned from brokerage and consulting services performed pertaining to mortgage servicing rights  as well as brokerage income earned from whole loan activities  retail and fixed income activities  and sba trading fees 
brokerage fees increased million  or  to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year this increase was the result of strong performance in whole loan brokerage activities  where fees increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december   as well as revenues generated as a result of the focus by first matrix on the acquisition  pooling and selling of sba loans and securities where revenue increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  when the sba activity began 
trust services 
trust service fees increased million  or  to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year during  the trust department at matrix bank began its operations 
the increase is due to an increase in total trust accounts under administration at sterling trust and matrix bank of  accounts at december  from  accounts at december  and total fiduciary assets under administration which increased to billion at december  from billion at december  much of the growth was driven by business referred to us by matrix settlement clearance services 
real estate disposition services 
real estate disposition services represents fees earned by matrix asset management for real estate management and disposition services provided on foreclosed properties owned by third party financial services companies and financial institutions 
real estate disposition service income increased million  or  between the fiscal years and to million 
the increase was due to the increase in the number of properties closed during the year  which increased  to  from  in additionally  the increase is due to new clients obtained as a result of prior marketing efforts 
properties under management were  at december  as compared to  at december  gain on sale of loans and securities 
gain on sale of loans and securities decreased million to  for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year gains on sale can fluctuate significantly from year to year based on a variety of factors  such as the current interest rate environment  the supply and mix of loan or securities portfolios available in the market  and as market conditions dictate  the particular loan portfolios we elect to sell 
gain on sale of mortgage servicing rights 
gain on sale of mortgage servicing rights increased  to approximately  for fiscal year as compared to  for fiscal year the increased gain was despite a decrease in terms of aggregate outstanding principal balances of mortgage loans underlying such mortgage servicing rights which we sold being million in purchased mortgage servicing rights during fiscal year as compared to billion during fiscal year gains from the sale of mortgage servicing rights can fluctuate significantly from year to year based on the market value of our servicing portfolio  the particular servicing portfolios we elect to sell and the availability of similar portfolios in the market 
due to our position in and knowledge of the market  and as market conditions dictate  we anticipate selling additional servicing rights to decrease our overall investment 
school services 
school services income represents fees earned by abs for outsourced business and consulting services provided primarily to charter schools 
school services income decreased  or  to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the rates paid by our core business service clients  which stood at schools at december  during the first six months of  in an effort to increase our client base and fee income on a national basis  abs incurred significant costs for personnel and marketing efforts 
ultimately  abs was not able to attract the amount of new contracts that it had targeted for the new school year  which begins in july of each year 
as a result of the lower than projected revenue  management has elected to focus on expense reductions and client retention rather than significant expansion 
we do not anticipate a significant increase in revenue for the coming year 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations comparison of results of operations for fiscal years and noninterest expense for discussion of goodwill write off 
other income 
other income decreased million  or  to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year the fiscal year income included million pre tax gain on sale of assets generated due to the condemnation of real estate held by matrix bank in denver  colorado  which was going to be used for relocation of matrix bank s domicile 
the city and county of denver condenmed the property in october a similar gain was not present in other income typcially includes service and atm fees  rental income  structured finance trading activities  along with other miscellaneous items 
noninterest expense 
noninterest expense increased million  or  to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year this increase was primarily due to inclusion of the million non cash impariment charge on mortgage servicing rights as compared to  in  a million charge to write off the goodwill balance at abs  a  loss on subleasing office space associated with the move to matrix financial center and million incremental reserves against other assets during the year ended december  in addition  the company experienced increases in compensation and benefits expense and other general and administrative expense due to increases to support growth and volume at matrix bank  matrix financial and first matrix 
the following table details the major components of noninterest expense for the periods indicated year ended december  in thousands compensation and employee benefits   amortization of mortgage servicing rights   occupancy and equipment   postage and communication   professional fees   data processing   impairment of mortgage servicing rights  other general and administrative   total   compensation and employee benefits increased million  or  to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year this increase was primarily the result of increases in personnel costs at matrix bank  matrix financial  first matrix and abs 
the increased costs are due to a combination of increased personnel and the inclusion of a full year of salary and benefits costs for employees added during the increase also reflects increased costs of medical benefits of for the year ended december  at these and the company s other subsidiaries 
the company had an overall decrease of employees  or  to employees at december  as compared to employees at december  this decrease occurred primarily in the fourth quarter of amortization of mortgage servicing rights increased million  or  to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year amortization of mortgage servicing rights fluctuates based on the size of our mortgage servicing portfolio and the prepayment rates experienced with respect to the underlying mortgage loan portfolio 
in response to the continued low interest rates prevalent in the market  prepayment speeds on our servicing portfolio increased to an average of during fiscal year as compared to during fiscal year  and the average balance of our mortgage servicing rights increased to million for the fiscal year as compared to million for the fiscal year 
however  the fourth quarter of experienced a much higher prepayment speed of than what was experienced in the first three quarters of impairment of mortgage servicing rights  which is a non cash charge  increased to million for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  with regard to the impairment charge  the company is required to record its investment in mortgage servicing rights at the lower of cost or fair value 
the fair value of mortgage servicing rights is determined based on the discounted future servicing income stratified based on one or more predominant risk characteristics of the underlying loans 
the company stratifies its mortgage servicing rights by product type and investor to reflect the predominant risks 
to determine the fair value of its investment  the company uses a valuation model that calculates the present value of future cash flows 
due to the drop in interest rates  both the actual and anticipated prepayment speeds used in the valuation model increased causing the fair value of the servicing to decrease below the carrying basis which resulted in an impairment 
the majority of the impairment related to the servicing rights retained by the company on its originations over the last year 
further decreases in interest rates  or increases in anticipated future prepayment speeds  may cause additional impairment charges in future periods 
the remainder of noninterest expense  which includes occupancy and equipment expense  postage and communication expense  professional fees  data processing costs and other expenses  increased million  or  to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year the increase is primarily related to the charges and reserves noted above  as well as increases in foreclosure expenses at matrix financial  miscellaneous operation expenses associated with additional volume at matrix bank  first matrix and matrix asset management  and incremental reserves and write offs of receivables primarily at abs 
income taxes 
income taxes decreased million to a benefit of million for fiscal year as compared to expense of million for fiscal year our effective tax benefit was for fiscal year as compared to an effective tax rate of for fiscal year due to the pre tax loss in the effective tax rates are affected by the level of tax exempt income at abs in proportion to the level of net income loss 
comparison of results of operations for fiscal years and net income  return on average equity 
net income increased million to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year on a per share basis  net income was per diluted share for fiscal year and for fiscal year return on average equity increased to for fiscal year as compared to for fiscal year the increases in net income  earnings per share and return on average equity were caused primarily by an increase in net interest income after provision for loan and valuation losses and large increases in loan origination income and loan administration fees generated at matrix financial  offset by increases in compensation and employee benefit costs and increased amortization expense on mortgage servicing rights 
net interest income 
net interest income before provision for loan and valuation losses increased million to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year our net interest income before provision for loan and valuation losses increased due to the million  or  increase in our interest earning assets 
additionally  an element of the increase was our net interest margin increasing to for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  although the yield on our interest earning assets decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december   that decrease was more than offset by the decrease in our cost of interest bearing liabilities which for the same periods decreased to from 
both the decrease in the yield on our interest earning assets and cost of interest bearing liabilities is a direct result of the interest rate environment prevalent in  which saw significant interest rate cuts by the federal reserve 
also  attributing to the increase in the margin was the overall increase in average noninterest bearing deposits to million at december  as compared to million at december  the increase in the noninterest bearing deposits is due to a combination of an increase in our custodial deposits and deposits generated from our investment in matrix settlement clearance services

provision for loan and valuation losses 
the provision for loan and valuation losses decreased million  or  to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year this decrease was primarily attributable to year including a significant charge off at abs of a loan to a school client which closed  as well as a high year provision at abs and matrix bank versus levels in for a discussion of the components of the allowance for loan losses  see asset and liability management analysis of allowance for loan and valuation losses

loan administration 
loan administration income represents service fees earned from servicing loans for various investors  which are based on a contractual percentage of the outstanding principal balance plus late fees and other ancillary charges  as well as activity in ginnie mae servicing portfolios 
loan administration fees increased million to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year loan administration fees are affected by factors that include the size of our residential mortgage loan servicing portfolio  the servicing spread  the timing of payment collections and the amount of ancillary fees received 
our mortgage loan servicing portfolio increased slightly to an average balance of billion for fiscal year as compared to an average balance of billion for fiscal year  despite significant increases in prepayment rates due to the declining interest rate environment in the latter part of the increase in loan administration fees was primarily driven by increased revenue generated from the purchasing of delinquent government loans out of our ginnie mae servicing and the subsequent sale of those loans 
the revenue generated from this activity was approximately million 
there were also increases in our ancillary fees 
the remainder of the increase is attributed to a slightly higher average servicing balance and a higher balance of government servicing which tends to have higher servicing fees 
brokerage fees 
brokerage fees represent income earned from brokerage and consulting services performed pertaining to mortgage servicing rights 
brokerage fees continued with trends and decreased million  or  to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year this decrease was the result of a decrease in the balance of residential mortgage servicing portfolios brokered by matrix capital markets  which in terms of aggregate unpaid principal balances on the underlying loans  decreased billion  or  to billion for fiscal year as compared to billion for fiscal year as previously discussed  the decrease noted is due to the consolidation that has taken place in the mortgage banking industry 
additionally  there was a decrease in whole loan revenue  again due to market conditions 
the overall market  including the number of buyers and sellers servicing  has decreased  and as a result  we have experienced an overall decrease in both the portfolios brokered and the corresponding revenue 
in any event  brokerage fees vary from quarter to quarter as the timing of servicing sales is dependent upon the seller s need to recognize a sale or to receive cash flows 
trust services 
trust service fees decreased  or  to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year the decrease in revenue is despite the fact that trust accounts under administration at sterling trust increased to  accounts at december  from  accounts at december  and total fiduciary assets under administration increased to billion at december  from billion at december  the growth in accounts and assets under administration occurred in third party administrator accounts  which increased in to  accounts  which are generally priced at lower fees based on the level of administration required and generate revenues based on number of transactions within accounts versus level of assets 
real estate disposition services 
real estate disposition services represents fees earned by matrix asset management for real estate management and disposition services provided on foreclosed properties owned by third party financial services companies and financial institutions 
real estate disposition service income decreased million  or  between the fiscal years and to million 
the decrease was due to the decrease in the number of properties closed during the year  which decreased  from  in to  in gain on sale of loans and securities 
gain on sale of loans and securities increased  to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year loan sales of approximately million in were completed under standard purchase and sale agreements  with standard representations and warranties and without recourse 
sales of securities were approximately million in and pertained to loans that the company had purchased and swapped for securities 
the gains from both types of these sales represent cash gains 
gains on sale can fluctuate significantly from year to year based on a variety of factors  such as the current interest rate environment  the supply and mix of loan or securities portfolios available in the market  the type of loan or securities portfolios we purchase and the particular loan portfolios we elect to sell 
gain on sale of mortgage servicing rights 
gain on sale of mortgage servicing rights decreased million to approximately  for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year in terms of aggregate outstanding principal balances of mortgage loans underlying such mortgage servicing rights  we sold billion in purchased mortgage servicing rights during fiscal year as compared to billion during fiscal year gains from the sale of mortgage servicing rights can fluctuate significantly from year to year based on the market value of our servicing portfolio  the particular servicing portfolios we elect to sell and the availability of similar portfolios in the market 
due to our position in and knowledge of the market  we expect to  at times  pursue opportunistic sales of mortgage servicing rights 
the year sale was undertaken to take advantage of aggressive pricing in the marketplace while the market was not as favorable of with the low interest rate environment prevalent throughout the year 
loan origination 
loan origination income includes all mortgage loan fees  secondary marketing activity on new loan originations for both residential and sba loans  and servicing release premiums on servicing sold and capitalized servicing on new originations sold  net of origination costs 
loan origination income increased million  or  to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year the increase is primarily attributable to an increase in wholesale residential mortgage loan production at matrix financial by billion  or  to billion during fiscal year as compared to million during fiscal year the increases in volume were due to our initiatives to increase origination platform and by the declining interest rate environment of school services 
school services income represents fees earned by abs for outsourced business and consulting services provided to schools 
school services income increased million  or  to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year this increase was primarily due to an increase in new school customers during other income 
other income increased million to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year the increase in other income was primarily due to million pre tax gain on sale of assets generated due to the condemnation of real estate held by matrix bank in denver  colorado  which was going to be used for relocation of matrix bank s domicile 
the city and county of denver condenmed the property in october noninterest expense 
noninterest expense increased million  or  to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year this increase was primarily due to increased compensation and benefits expense  increased amortization of mortgage servicing rights and increased other general and administrative expense  offset by a decrease in professional fees

matrix financial s salary expense increased related to its initiative to develop its production platform and million of the total company increase in compensation and employee benefits is attributable to matrix financial 
this initiative involved opening two new production offices  acquiring a servicing and production platform and hiring additional administrative and production staff in late which operated all of the company had an overall increase of employees  or  to employees at december  as compared to employees at december  amortization of mortgage servicing rights increased million  or  to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year amortization of mortgage servicing rights fluctuates based on the size of our mortgage servicing portfolio and the prepayment rates experienced with respect to the underlying mortgage loan portfolio 
in response to the lower interest rates prevalent in the market  prepayment speeds on our servicing portfolio increased to an average of during fiscal year as compared to during fiscal year the remainder of noninterest expense  which includes occupancy and equipment expense  postage and communication expense  professional fees  data processing costs and other expenses  increased million  or  to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year the million increase in other general and administrative expense was primarily attributable to increases in foreclosure and reo expenses  increases in travel and entertainment costs  and in other miscellaneous expenses associated with the increased number of employees  and increases in outside services  consulting and temporary help  as well as a  charge recorded related to the relocation of matrix bank s domicile primarily for severence and contract benefits to be paid to certain of matrix bank s employees 
for further discussion of these charges  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
this was offset by a million decrease in professional fees related mainly to high amounts in for litigation at sterling trust and legal expenses associated with the harbor settlement which were not incurred in for a discussion of the harbor items  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
provision for income taxes 
our provision for income taxes increased million to million for fiscal year as compared to million for fiscal year the increase in pre tax income was enhanced by a reduction in our effective tax rate to for fiscal year from for fiscal year the decrease in the effective tax rate was the result of our origination of tax exempt financing at abs

     asset and liability management general 
a significant portion of our revenues and net income is derived from net interest income and  accordingly  we strive to manage our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to generate what we believe to be an appropriate contribution from net interest income 
asset and liability management seeks to control the volatility of our performance due to changes in interest rates 
we constantly attempt to achieve an appropriate relationship between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities 
we have responded to interest rate volatility by developing and implementing asset and liability management strategies designed to increase noninterest income and improve the match between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
these strategies include o utilizing mortgage servicing rights as a source of noninterest income and as a countermeasure against the decline in the value of mortgage loans during a rising interest rate environment 
increases in interest rates tend to increase the value of mortgage servicing rights because of the resulting decrease in prepayment rates on the underlying loans  o focusing on noninterest bearing custodial escrow balances related to our mortgage servicing rights  o increasing focus on lines of business that are less interest rate sensitive  such as brokerage activities  consulting services  self directed trust services  clearing operations  real estate disposition and school business services  o originating and purchasing adjustable rate mortgages and selling newly originated fixed rate residential mortgages in the secondary market  o increasing emphasis on the origination of construction  multi family and commercial real estate lending  including sba loans  which tend to have higher interest rates with shorter loan maturities than residential mortgage loans and generally are at adjustable rates  o acquisition and sales of guaranteed portions of sba loans  which are generally at adjustable rates  o extending the maturity of our interest bearing liabilities by borrowing term advances from the fhlb  o increasing retail deposits  which are less susceptible to changes in interest rates than other funding sources  o historically  maintaining a wholesale loan origination operation 
wholesale originations provide a form of hedge against the balance of mortgage servicing rights 
in a decreasing interest rate environment  the value of the servicing portfolio tends to decrease due to increased prepayments of the underlying loans 
during this same environment  however  the volume of loan originations generally increases 
due to the declining investment in mortgage servicing rights and the increased operation and financial risk associated with the wholesale operations  we have elected to sell the wholesale production platform 
see item business sale of wholesale production platform  o pursuing institutional alliances or depository relationships that provide fee based income or generate liabilities that are less expensive or less interest rate sensitive than retail deposits or borrowings from third party institutions to fund our investing activities  o using matrix bank as the settlement bank for settlement and clearing services offered by sterling trust and matrix settlement clearance services to generate low cost deposits  o hedging segments of our servicing portfolio and selling forward commitments on our loan pipeline  and o expanding our trust activities to provide custodial services to matrix settlement clearance services clients to increase fee income and low cost deposits 
many of the strategies outlined were successfully initiated during matrix bank is positively gapped  which means that its assets will re price quicker than its liabilities as interest rates fluctuate 
as a result  if interest rates increase  the rising interest rates should have a positive impact on the net interest income 
however  if interest rates remain static or decrease further  we should experience some compression in our net interest income as many of our interest bearing and noninterest bearing liabilities cannot re price any lower 
due to the year low interest rate environment  our investment in mortgage servicing rights was very unprofitable in  including the provision of million to increase our impairment reserve 
in  we will continue to manage interest rate risk under similar strategies 
lending activities 
our major interest earning asset is our loan portfolio 
consequently  a significant part of our asset and liability management involves monitoring the composition of our loan portfolio  including the corresponding maturities

as part of asset and liability management  we monitor nonperforming assets on a monthly basis 
nonperforming assets consist primarily of nonaccrual loans and foreclosed real estate 
loans are placed on nonaccrual when full payment of principal or interest is in doubt or when they are past due days as to either principal or interest 
foreclosed real estate arises primarily through foreclosure on mortgage loans owned

the aggregate unpaid principal balance of government sponsored accruing loans that were past due or more days was million  million and million of december   and  respectively 
nonaccrual residential mortgage loans as a percentage of total loans were at december   at december   at december   at december and at december  the nonaccrual residential mortgage loans have improved at december  as compared to december  the improvement is due to maturity and improvement in certain portfolios acquired in and on which the recourse option we had was eliminated with the bankruptcy of the seller servicer 
the balance of these loans in nonaccrual at december  totals million as compared to million at december  associated with these nonaccrual loans  we have recorded  of discounts 
the decrease in nonaccrual commercial loans and school financing in is primarily attributable to the decreased amount of commercial real estate and construction loans in nonaccrual status  which decreased million to million at december  this decrease was offset by increased amounts of sba originated and purchased loans in nonaccrual status  which increased million to million at december  it should be noted  however  that approximately million of the interest and principal of these loans is guaranteed  and as such  our credit risk is minimized despite the increase in the balances 
with regard to our school financing  a majority of our origination of tax exempt financing for charter schools is for the purchase of real estate and equipment 
we have noted that many of our charter schools have encountered enrollment and or state funding delays with their start up  which has delayed their funding and caused the school s loans to us to become delinquent 
we have historically  however  been able to work with many of the schools on their cash flow issues and eventually removed them from the delinquent lists 
not included in the balance was million of delinquent school financing and  of foreclosed real estate that was sold to a third party with recourse 
the losses related to the delinquencies and foreclosures would be recorded as part of noninterest expense 
as of december   no recording of a liability was considered necessary 
the prior delinquency and anticipated future delinquencies are taken into consideration in the pricing of the loans acquired 
we generally purchase such loans at discounts and  in limited instances  receive recourse from the seller to further reduce our risk of loss associated with the loans nonaccrual status 
at december   million  or  of the nonaccrual loans were loans that were residential loans purchased in bulk loan portfolios and remain classified as held for sale 
total loans held for sale at december   were billion  of which million  or  were in nonaccrual status 
analysis of allowance for loan and valuation losses 
the following table sets forth information regarding changes in our allowance for loan and valuation losses for the periods indicated 
the table includes the allowance for both loans held for investment and loans held for sale 
as of and for the year ended december  dollars in thousands balance at beginning of year      charge offs real estate mortgage   real estate construction commercial loans and school financing  consumer total charge offs     recoveries real estate mortgage commercial loans and school financing consumer total recoveries net charge offs     provision for loan losses charged to operations      balance at end of year      ratio of net charge offs to average loans average loans outstanding during the year      the allowance for loan and valuation losses is analyzed by management as discussed below and is increased by the provision for loan and valuation losses  which is charged to operations  as necessary 
the allowance for loan and valuation losses is calculated  in part  based on historical loss experience 
in addition  management takes into consideration other factors  such as o qualitative evaluations of individual classified assets  o geographic and other portfolio concentrations  o new products or markets  o evaluations of the changes in the historical loss experience component  and o projections of this component into the current and future periods based on current knowledge and conditions 
these loss factors range from for fha va loans guaranteed by the hud  to for credit card loans 
the loss factors are applied to the outstanding principal balance of loans in their respective categories 
loans in the commercial and school finance portfolios are assigned loss factors based on items similar to those listed  plus additional individual loan review on all significant loans  including sba loans  which result in loans being classified as watch  substandard or doubtful 
the company considers a loan impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that it will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan 
accordingly  potential impaired loans of the company include only commercial loans  real estate construction loans  commercial real estate mortgage loans and school financing 
impairment allowances are considered by the company in determining the overall adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
after an allowance has been established for the loan portfolio  management establishes a portion of the allowance for loan losses  which is attributed to factors that cannot be associated with a specific loan or loan portfolio 
the company evaluates its residential loans collectively due to their homogeneous nature 
these factors include o general economic conditions  o recognition of specific regional geographic concerns  o loan type and the assessed risk inherent in each loan category  and o trends in the portfolio and portfolio growth trends 
substandard and doubtful loans of homogeneous loan portfolios are assigned loss factors of to 
the loss factors are applied to the outstanding principal balances of loans in their respective categories 
the total for all categories as described above determines our allowance for loan and valuation losses 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when the probability of collection is considered remote 
the following table shows information regarding the components of our allowance for loan and valuation losses as of the dates indicated as of december  percentage percentage percentage percentage percentage of loans of loans of loans of loans of loans in each in each in each in each in each category category category category category to to to to to total total total total total amount loans amount loans amount loans amount loans amount loans dollars in thousands residential      multi family  commercial real estate and commercial    school financing     construction consumer the ratio of the allowance for loan and valuation losses to total loans was at december   at december  at december   at december   and at december  the allowance for loan and valuation losses is reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
the balance of the allowance for loan and valuation losses allocated to residential has decreased  due to the decrease in these loans in nonaccrual status  while the balance of loan and valuation losses allocated to multi family  commercial real estate  commercial  school financing and construction loans has increased mainly due to the increased outstanding loan principal balances in these loan categories 
as noted in  we had increased our origination of non to family loans  which are perceived to be higher risk and also are a contributor to the overall increase in the balance of the allowance in prior year 
as of december   we believe that the allowance  when taken as a whole  is adequate to absorb losses in the current loan portfolio 
risk sensitive assets and liabilities 
as discussed in asset and liability management general a significant portion of our operations and ultimate success is partially dependent upon our ability to manage our interest rate risk 
interest rate risk can be defined as the exposure of our net interest income to adverse movements in interest rates 
although we manage other risks  such as credit  operational and liquidity risk in the normal course of business  we consider interest rate risk to be a significant market risk which could potentially have the largest material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the majority of our market risk related to interest rates exists within the operations of matrix bank 
however  matrix financial also has interest rate risk related to its primary asset  mortgage servicing rights  and also related to its loan origination volumes  as well as the net interest income earned on its originated loans that are funded through warehouse lines of credit 
with the majority of matrix financial s operations being funded by matrix bank  this is a smaller risk to the company as compared to when matrix financial s operations were funded entirely by unaffiliated financial institutions 
the susceptibility to movements in interest rates affects the cash flows generated from the mortgage servicing rights which are recorded in other income versus interest income 
in a decreasing interest rate environment  the underlying servicing portfolio tends to prepay faster which reduces future servicing income  while in an increasing interest rate environment  prepayments tend to decrease  which increases expected future servicing income 
as it relates to matrix financial s lending activities  matrix financial originates residential mortgage loans  which are generally pre sold 
however  between the time that the loan is originated and sold to the ultimate investor  matrix financial earns interest income 
the loans are funded through the use of warehouse credit facilities or borrowings from matrix bank  both of which are generally priced based on short term interest rates 
therefore  the net interest income that is earned by matrix financial is generally dependent on the spread between long term mortgage rates and short term interest rates 
aside from matrix financial s investment in servicing rights  the majority of the risk associated with interest rate movements relates more to the overhead associated with our origination platform 
as discussed  a significant portion of the loan origination is directly related to the interest rate environment 
overhead significantly increased in and continued in to support the higher levels of originations 
as a result  when interest rates increase and originations decrease  there is a risk that we will not be able to manage our overhead proportionally to the overall decrease in loan origination income 
due to this risk and other risk previously discussed  in early  we have elected to sell the wholesale origination platform 
see item business sale of wholesale production platform 
we currently do not maintain a trading portfolio 
as a result  we are not exposed to market risk as it relates to trading activities 
the majority of our residential loan portfolio is held for sale which requires us to perform quarterly market valuations of the portfolio in order to properly record the portfolio at the lower of aggregate cost or market 
therefore  we continually monitor the interest rates of our loan portfolio as compared to prevalent interest rates in the market 
interest rate risk management at matrix bank is the responsibility of the asset and liability committee  which reports to the board of directors of matrix bank 
the asset and liability committee establishes policies that monitor and coordinate our sources  uses and pricing of funds 
the asset and liability committee is also involved in formulating our budget and strategic plan as it relates to investment objectives 
we have engaged a third party to provide consulting services that assists us with our asset liability management 
we meet with this consulting firm quarterly to review the results of our interest rate risk analysis and to discuss strategies 
we have recently purchased the software to be able to internally model our interest rate risk 
the software was developed by the third party consultant mentioned above 
we will continue to engage this consulting firm on a quarterly basis to supplement our internal modeling 
part of the modeling is done to comply with the requirements of the office of thrift supervision 
we continue to attempt to reduce the volatility in net interest income by managing the relationship of interest rate sensitive assets to interest rate sensitive liabilities 
to accomplish this  we focus on acquiring adjustable rate residential mortgages and have increased our efforts regarding the origination of residential construction loans  multi family loans  commercial real estate loans  sba loans and limited consumer lending  which re price or mature more quickly than fixed rate residential real estate loans 
in the fourth quarter of  we began a strategy of purchasing with the intent to sell the guaranteed portion of sba loans 
again  the loans generally adjust with prime and present very little interest rate risk 
the other significant asset that we invest in is residential mortgage servicing rights 
the value and cash flows from residential mortgage servicing rights respond counter cyclically to the value of fixed rate mortgages 
when interest rates increase and the value of fixed rate mortgages decrease  in turn decreasing net interest income  the value of the mortgage servicing rights increase 
in a decreasing interest rate environment  the inverse occurs 
it is important to note  however  that an equal increase or decrease in interest rates will not affect the value of our mortgage servicing rights portfolio equally 
a decrease in interest rates causes a greater reduction in the value of the portfolio as compared to the increase in value in the portfolio from an equal increase in interest rates 
the scenario discussed of decreasing interest rates is exactly what happened in the interest rate environment in was historically low 
in response to the low interest rates  we experienced significant runoff in our servicing portfolio  as well as a million decrease in the fair value of our investment in mortgage servicing rights 
due to the volatility of the value of mortgage servicing  we do not anticipate increasing our investment in to the contrary  we expect our overall investment in to decrease through normal runoff 
another significant strategy that we focus on in managing interest rate risk is identifying lines of business that generate noninterest rate sensitive liabilities 
examples of this strategy are the investment in mortgage servicing rights  which generate no cost escrow deposits  sterling trust s operations  which administer deposits with relatively low costs  and our investment in matrix settlement clearance services that uses  or its clients use  matrix bank as the clearing bank and trustee  which creates low cost deposits 
in the ordinary course of business  we make commitments to originate residential mortgage loans and hold originated loans until delivery to an investor 
inherent in this business are risks associated with changes in interest rates and the resulting change in the market value of the pipeline loans 
we mitigate this risk through the use of mandatory and best effort forward commitments to sell loans and securities 
as of december   we had million in pipeline and funded loans  offset with mandatory forward commitments of million and best effort forward commitments of million 
the market value of loans committed for sale is determined based on the related forward loan sale commitments 
effective january   with the adoption of sfas  we were required to treat substantially all mortgage loan commitments and loan sale commitments both mandatory and best effort as derivatives and record the fair value of those derivatives on the balance sheet and any subsequent changes in the fair value of those derivatives through current earnings 
as the changes in fair value of the loan commitments and the loan sale commitments are generally expected to offset one another  we do not anticipate any material impact to our future earnings from pipeline loans as a result of the adoption of sfas see item business sale of wholesale production platform 
ownership of mortgage servicing rights exposes us to impairment of their value in certain interest rate environments 
the incidence of prepayment of a mortgage loan increases during periods of declining interest rates as the homeowner seeks to refinance the loan to a lower interest rate 
if the level of prepayment on segments of our mortgage servicing portfolio achieves a level higher than we projected for an extended period of time  then an impairment in the associated basis in the mortgage servicing rights may occur 
to mitigate this risk of impairment due to declining interest rates  we initiated a hedging program on a portion of our investment 
in addition  in september  we began to sell substantially all of our newly originated servicing rights with the intent of reducing our overall investment in mortgage servicing rights 
with regards to our interest sensitive liabilities during  in order to take advantage of the historically low interest rates  matrix bank entered into short option agreements and other longer term advances to years totaling million  adding to short option agreements entered into primarily in for a total of million  which have interest rates ranging from to 
it is anticipated that our interest margin will benefit in the long term from locking in these interest rates 
the following tables represent  in tabular form  contractual balances of our on balance sheet financial instruments in dollars at the expected maturity dates  as well as the fair value of those on balance sheet financial instruments for the periods ended december  and the expected maturity categories take into consideration historical and anticipated prepayment speeds  as well as actual amortization of principal and do not take into consideration the reinvestment of cash 
our assets and liabilities that do not have a stated maturity date  such as interest earning deposits  fhlb stock and certain other deposits  are considered to be long term in nature and are reported in the thereafter column 
we are very active in the secondary market as it relates to the purchase and sale of mortgage loans 
we use a five year maturity assumption for all of matrix bank s held for sale loans and school financing  and we use a one year maturity assumption for matrix financial s originated loans held for sale 
we also treat the fhlb and revolving borrowings as long term in nature  as the continued availability of these amounts is anticipated indefinitely 
third party servicers service a portion of our loan portfolio  as a result  a portion of the information presented is based on the best available information 
for the most part  the carrying amounts of interest earning deposits  fhlb stock  fhlb borrowings and borrowed money approximate those assets and liabilities fair values 
the fair values of the loan portfolios held for sale and held for investment are based on quoted market prices or outstanding commitments from investors 
if quoted market prices are not available  fair values are based on quoted market prices of similar loans sold in securitization transactions  adjusted for differences in loan characteristics 
the fair values of demand deposits are  by definition  equal to the amount payable upon demand at the reporting date 
the fair value of time deposits are based upon the discounted value of contractual cash flows  which is estimated using interest rates currently being offered on certificates to a schedule of aggregated expected periodic maturities on time deposits 
mortgage servicing rights are not included in the tabular presentation  because the investment does not directly affect interest income 
as noted  however  earnings from mortgage servicing rights directly correlate with market risk as it relates to interest rate fluctuations 
in the past  we attempted to mitigate a portion of this risk by the type of mortgage servicing rights we acquire 
the loans underlying the servicing rights acquired tend to be more seasoned and have lower principal balances 
management believes that the more seasoned  lower balance servicing portfolios carry less prepayment risk than less seasoned  higher balance mortgage servicing  because the cost savings of refinancing a lower balance loan tend to be less than for a higher balance loan with a comparable interest rate 
we also believe that if a loan has been outstanding for a period of time and has been through several declining interest rate cycles without refinancing  the risk of prepayment in the future is less than a newly originated loan 
however  due to the lack of seasoned servicing available and the expansion of our origination platform  we began to retain a portion of our originated servicing in and continued through august in august  the company began to sell the majority of its newly originated servicing under an assignment of trade contract and anticipates doing so in the near term 
this strategy was implemented to reduce our future investment in mortgage servicing rights 
the prepayment percentages which we have experienced over the past three years have been lower than experienced in the industry  as a whole 
the prepayment speeds for the years ended december   and were   and  respectively 
in the tables below  prepayment speeds of and for and  respectively  were used for all loan types to project expected cash flows 
these assumptions are based on our historical prepayment speeds  as well as our knowledge and experience in the market

short term borrowings 
a primary function of asset and liability management is to ensure adequate liquidity 
in addition to cash and cash equivalents  we rely heavily on short term borrowing capabilities for liquidity and as a funding vehicle 
the primary sources for short term borrowings are the fhlb for matrix bank  matrix bank and unaffiliated financial institutions for matrix financial  an unaffiliated financial institution for matrix capital markets  and at matrix bancorp  the revolving portion of the bank stock loan

matrix bank is required to maintain classified assets of less than of total assets and must also earn in excess of million over the previous four quarters 
the covenants must be met quarterly

the company is reliant on dividend and tax payments from its subsidiaries in order to fund operations  meet debt obligations and grow new or developing lines of business 
a long term inability of a subsidiary to make dividend payments could significantly impact the company s liquidity 
historically  the majority of the dividend payments have been made by matrix bank and its consolidated subsidiaries  which include matrix financial 
the current dividend policy approved by matrix bank is of the consolidated cumulative earnings of matrix bank 
due to the loss incurred during the year ended december  as a result of the servicing asset impairment  matrix bank is currently not in a position to pay dividends under its current policy for the last quarter of matrix bank has not paid a dividend since august which reflected earnings from july matrix bank currently anticipates that it will resume dividend payments under current policy in march in the interim  the company intends to utilize dividends from its other subsidiaries and the line of credit on its bank stock loan  as needed  to meet its own and the other subsidiaries financial obligations 
matrix bank s primary source of funds for use in lending  purchasing bulk loan portfolios  investing and other general purposes are o retail deposits  o trust deposits  o custodial escrow balances  o brokered deposits  o fhlb borrowings  o sales of loan portfolios  and o proceeds from principal and interest payments on loans 
contractual loan payments and net deposit inflows are a generally predictable source of funds  while loan prepayments and loan sales are significantly influenced by general market interest rates and economic conditions 
borrowings on a short term basis are used as a cash management vehicle to compensate for seasonal or other reductions in normal sources of funds 
matrix bank utilizes advances from the fhlb as its primary source for borrowings 
at december   matrix bank had overnight and term borrowings from the fhlb of million 
the availability of fhlb borrowings is based on the level of collateral pledged 
generally  the availability will be limited to the lesser of of the collateral pledged or of total assets 
the custodial escrow balances held by matrix bank fluctuate based upon the mix and size of the related mortgage servicing rights portfolios and the timing of payments for taxes and insurance  as well as the level of prepayments which occur 
for a tabular presentation of the our short term borrowings  see asset and liability management short term borrowings 
matrix bank offers a variety of deposit accounts having a range of interest rates and terms

therefore  its retail deposits are concentrated primarily in las cruces and sun city  except for the internet deposits  which could be out of market retail deposits 
matrix bank relies principally on customer service  marketing programs and its relationships with customers to attract and retain in market deposits 
brokered deposits are accepted and have been utilized to support growth at matrix bank

the company has placed tax exempt financing of approximately million at december  it originated to charter schools into two grantor trusts 
the trusts then issued class a certificates and class b certificates  with the class a certificates being sold to various third party investors under a private placement at a price of par 
the a certificates under the two grantor trusts are guaranteed by a letter of credit issued by a third party investment bank for one  and the second one is guaranteed equally by two unaffiliated financial institutions 
the a certificates interest rate may be determined weekly  monthly or for a term for up to one year 
the interest rate and the term of the interest rate are determined by the remarking agent  which is also the investment bank 
generally  the trusts are short term in nature with an average life of one year or less 
the b certificates are owned by the company 
the interest rate paid on the a certificates is considered the company s financing cost 
the approximate cost of the financing at december  and was and  respectively 
the interest that the company receives through its part ownership of the b certificates is tax exempt 
although a certificates are guaranteed by unaffiliated entities  the company provides full recourse to the unaffiliated entities in all cases of loss or default 
due to the nature of the recourse and the ability of the a certificate holders to put the certificates to the trusts  the transactions have been accounted for as a secured financing 
in addition  under a purchase and sale agreement  abs has sold school financings to an unaffiliated financial institution 
the school financings were sold with full recourse to abs 
abs services the school financings on a scheduled scheduled remittance and in the case of a loss or default  upon the liquidation of the underlying collateral  abs is required to reimburse for any shortfall 
due to the control that the unaffiliated financial institution has over the school financing  the transaction was accounted for as a sale 
the recourse provisions were considered by us at the time of the sale 
no gain or loss was booked at the sale date 
the total balance of the school financings sold with recourse was million at december  matrix bank and sterling trust are restricted in certain instances from paying dividends to matrix bancorp due to certain regulatory requirements

unlike most industrial companies  substantially all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature

critical accounting policies the company and its subsidiaries have established various accounting policies which govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in the preparation and presentation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
the significant accounting policies of the company are described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments  assumptions and estimates by management that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  which management considers to be critical accounting policies 
the judgments  assumptions and estimates used by management are based on historical experience  knowledge of the accounts and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management  actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates  which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of operations of the company 
the company believes the allowance for loan and valuation losses is a critical accounting policy that requires the most significant judgments  assumptions and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
see discussion at asset and liability management  analysis of allowance for loan and valuation losses for a detailed description of the company s process and methodology related to the allowance for loan and valuation losses 
the company also considers the valuation of mortgage servicing rights to be a critical accounting policy that requires judgments  assumptions and estimates concerning impairment of their value in certain interest rate environments 
see business  mortgage servicing activities for a detailed discussion of the nature of the servicing rights  and see note of the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion concerning the use of estimates in the valuation of mortgage servicing rights 
the company also considers the judgments and assumptions concerning litigation as a critical accounting policy 
the company has been notified that we are a defendant in a number of legal proceedings 
most of these cases involve ordinary and routine claims incidental to our business 
based on management s analysis  no accrual for loss has been made as of december  for any such cases 
see a full description of such proceedings at item legal proceedings 
with respect to all pending litigation matters  our ultimate legal responsibility  if any  cannot be estimated with certainty 
based on the ultimate outcome of such proceedings  it is possible that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions related to such proceedings
