item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our two primary businesses are in the defense and transportation industries 
for the year ended september   percent of sales were derived from defense  while percent were derived from transportation fare collection systems and other commercial operations 
these are high technology businesses that design  manufacture and integrate complex systems to meet the needs of various federal and regional government agencies in the us and other nations around the world 
the us government remains our largest customer  accounting for approximately percent of sales for compared to percent in and percent in cubic defense applications is a diversified supplier of constructive  live and virtual military training systems  services and communication products to the us department of defense  other government agencies and allied nations 
we design instrumented range systems for fighter aircraft  armored vehicles and infantry force on force live training  weapons effects simulations  laser based tactical and communication systems  and precision gunnery solutions 
our services are focused on training mission support  computer simulation training  distributed interactive simulation  development of military training doctrine  force modernization services for nato entrants and field operations and maintenance 
our communications products are aimed at intelligence  surveillance  and search and rescue markets 
cubic transportation systems develops and delivers innovative fare collection systems for public transit authorities worldwide 
we provide hardware  software and multi agency  multi modal transportation integration technologies and services that allow the agencies to efficiently collect fares  manage their operations  reduce shrinkage and make using public transit a more convenient and attractive option for commuters 
consolidated overview sales for fiscal were million  an increase of percent over fiscal sales of million  establishing a new record high for cubic 
the sales level represented a percent increase over sales of million 
sales growth in and came from both business segments  with the biggest increase in coming from defense 
defense sales in were up percent over  from million to million  due primarily to increases from training systems contracts 
growth in defense sales had been percent from to transportation systems sales increased approximately percent in  from million to million  after having increased almost percent from to transportation systems sales in were higher in north america  due to new contracts won last year  and in london  as work on the prestige contract hit a high point in the first two quarters of the year 
net income grew percent in to million  or per share  also a record high for cubic 
net income in had grown by percent over  from million 
per share to million per share 
approximately million  after taxes  of the net income was from gains on the sale of real estate in the second and third quarters  representing about cents per share 
net income in had included a fourth quarter tax benefit of million and charges related to facility closing costs in the united kingdom of million  after taxes  incurred in the first quarter 
goodwill amortization under former accounting rules had reduced net income by about million after taxes  while we had also realized a million gain  after taxes  from the sale of securities in that year 
as depicted on the table below  without these items net income would have been about million  million and million pro forma  and 
per share in the years ended september   and  respectively 
earnings before the items identified below grew by percent from to and by percent from to these increases were the result of increased sales volume and improved operating income from both segments  with the biggest increases coming from the defense business 
in millions earnings before certain identified items change in goodwill accounting gains on sale of real estate and securities tax benefit facility closing costs net income  as reported gross margins declined to percent in from percent in and percent in in the transportation segment  sales increases came from the prestige contract in london  which has lower than average margins  and from new contracts in north america  which are in the development phase  a time when contracts typically yield lower margins 
gross margins in the defense segment also declined somewhat in  due primarily to lower than normal margins from the operations and maintenance business 
see the segment sections following for further details 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses grew by about million from to and fell to percent of sales  compared to percent in and percent in the increase in sg a spending came primarily from the transportation segment  due to increased legal costs related to a contractual dispute with a former subcontractor on the prestige contract and other contract related legal matters in the u 
s and australia 
in the increase in sg a spending resulted from heightened proposal activity for potential new contracts in the defense segment  while the transportation segment increased its marketing efforts in europe 
in  the transportation segment also incurred legal costs in connection with our dispute of a contract tender in australia and we provided for costs related to shutting down a facility in england 
research and development r d spending was lower in than in as we shifted engineering resources from company sponsored activities to customer funded development activities 
we do not rely heavily on independent r d  as most of our new product development occurs in conjunction with the performance of work on our contracts 
the amount of contract required product development activity increased in to million  compared to million in and  however  these costs are included in cost of sales as they are directly related to contract performance 
we realized gains from the sale of two real properties during the year  one in san diego county and the other in england 
net proceeds from the sale of the san diego property were million  which generated a pretax gain of million 
we had owned this property for more than years and had previously used it in a divested operation  but have held the property as an investment for the past ten years 
the gain from the sale of this property was realized in the second quarter 
the facility south of london was sold for approximately million  resulting in a pretax gain of million 
we had owned that facility for nearly years  but acquired a different facility in the same area last year and moved into the refurbished building this year  therefore  the old facility was no longer required 
the gain from the sale of this property was realized in the third quarter 
interest and dividend income decreased in both and  because of declining interest rates in both years and due to lower cash balances available for investment in in addition  other income was lower due to decreased rental income because we sold the building in san diego county described above  which was previously leased to an unrelated company 
our effective tax rate for was about percent of pretax income compared to percent in and percent in income tax expense for the year ended september  was unusually low due to a million tax benefit realized from our subsidiary in denmark during the fourth quarter 
we expect our effective tax rate in to increase to percent and to as high as percent in following years as more of our income is generated from our us businesses rather than from the us  where the corporate income tax rate is lower 
this effective rate could be affected in future years by  among other factors  the mix of business between the us and foreign jurisdictions  our ability to take advantage of available tax credits and audits of our records by taxing authorities 
defense segment as depicted in the following table  defense segment sales increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  a percent increase 
this growth followed an percent increase in sales from to the increase in both years came from our existing defense training and government services businesses 
the most significant growth in came from a percent increase in training systems sales due to significant new orders for our miles products and air combat training systems 
government services sales grew by percent in after having increased by percent in we continued to solidify our position in as an important service provider to the us government 
sales of communications and electronics systems decreased by percent in from the level after having decreased by percent in however  we were awarded several new communications contracts in that create potential for growth in this business area 
years ended september  in millions defense segment sales communications and electronics training systems government services defense segment operating income communications and electronics training systems government services goodwill amortization operating income in the defense segment was up by percent over the level  from million to million 
this increase followed significant profit improvement from to as well 
higher operating income came primarily from the training systems business due to sales growth and improved profit margins from air combat training systems 
operating income in training systems was impacted by cost growth of nearly million on a contract which includes the development of new ground combat training technology for an overseas customer 
this new product development has added important additional capability to our ground combat training systems 
approximately offsetting this expense provision within the training systems business was the reversal of the remaining balance of a reserve we had established in fiscal for the estimated costs to complete the original miles development and production contract 
during the year we worked with the customer to resolve all remaining contractual and financial issues related to this contract without expenditure of the approximately million balance of the reserve  therefore  it is no longer required 
government services operating income was lower primarily because of a change in estimated profits on an operations and maintenance contract  which produced a loss on the contract for the year 
work on this contract has now been completed and the situation that caused the loss has been resolved 
operating income in communications and electronics improved in over the level primarily because of improved performance from the surveillance receiver product line 
operating income was impacted in  however  by a strategic decision we made to invest in new communications technology  which resulted in the award of a new contract in the second quarter 
we expect that the development costs will cause total costs of the contract to exceed the contract value by approximately million and  therefore  recorded an expense provision of that amount in the second quarter 
operating income for the segment was also higher in both and than in because of the adoption of financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
in  which required the discontinuance of goodwill amortization 
had this pronouncement been in effect in  operating profits for the segment would have been higher by approximately million in that year 
transportation systems segment transportation segment sales increased percent  from million in fiscal to million in sales in represented a percent increase over sales of million 
these increases were the result of new contracts awarded in recent years in north america as well as sales growth from the prestige contract in london 
operating income increased from million in to million in  a percent increase 
operating income increased percent in from the level of million 
operating income in included million in costs for a facility closure  while had included goodwill amortization expense of million 
without these expenses  operating income would have been million in and million in and the increases year over year would have been percent in and percent in operating income in the transportation systems segment improved in both and primarily because of growth in north american revenues and due to the discontinuance of goodwill amortization  as described above 
growth of operating income in was limited due to legal costs incurred related to a dispute with a subcontractor on the prestige contract described below and due to a legal settlement in australia which occurred during the fourth quarter 
the growth in operating profits in fiscal had also been limited somewhat due to the facility closing costs mentioned above and by legal costs incurred in connection with our dispute of a contract tender in australia 
profit margins recorded on the prestige contract continue to be at a lower level than we expect ultimately to achieve as the result of work we are performing in place of a subcontractor that was terminated in fiscal as discussed in note to the financial statements  we expect to ultimately recover the additional costs incurred from the subcontractor  but cannot anticipate recovery in our calculation of profits on the contract at this time because the conditions required by generally accepted accounting principles have not yet been achieved 
backlog both funded and total backlog increased significantly during to billion and billion  respectively  with increases coming from both segments 
the biggest increase in defense funded backlog was in training systems  due to contracts we won for ground combat training systems in canada and australia 
funded backlog also increased in communications because of important contract awards in this business as well 
total defense backlog was bolstered by service contracts awards for multi year contracts that will be funded in annual increments 
transportation systems backlog increased in because of a contract for nearly million awarded by the city of brisbane  australia for a transportation system and ten years of operations and maintenance 
not included in the backlog as of september  is a million contract awarded to cubic by marta  the city of atlanta s transit agency  in october  after the close of the fiscal year 
we believe the increase in backlog to the highest level in our history is significant not just because of the amount of the increase  but because of the makeup of the backlog 
our previous record high backlog was billion in at that time the prestige contract represented percent of our total backlog and defense was only percent of the total 
as of september   backlog was million higher than in and prestige was only percent of the total  with defense about half of the total 
therefore  not only has the backlog grown  but it has done so in a much broader manner  so we are not as reliant on a single contract or customer for our revenues 
not reflected in the backlog amounts below  because they are indefinite delivery  indefinite quantity idiq contracts  are two significant defense contracts with the us government that were awarded during one is a year contract with a ceiling value of million to develop and deliver the next generation of rangeless air to air and air to ground combat training systems 
we expect that the customer will order most of the systems specified by this contract from us over the next years 
the second major idiq contract awarded during the year is one where cubic and four other companies will perform research and development services for the us government aimed at reducing threats to national defense and homeland security from weapons of mass destruction 
the five companies will share a total of up to billion in task orders 
although relatively small  we did receive our first task order under this contract in august the initial term of this contract is five years  with an option for a five year extension 
september  in millions total backlog transportation systems defense communications and electronics training systems government services total defense total funded backlog transportation systems defense communications and electronics training systems government services total defense total in transportation systems  the difference between total backlog and funded backlog represents extension of the service portion of the prestige contract for the final five years of the seventeen year contract 
we have treated this portion of the contract as unfunded until we complete the initial system installation phase of the contract  which is expected to occur within the next several months 
options for the purchase of additional systems or equipment are not included in backlog until exercised 
in defense  the difference between total backlog and funded backlog represents options under multi year service contracts 
funding for these contracts comes from annual operating budgets of the us government and the options are normally exercised annually 
options for the purchase of additional systems or equipment are not included in backlog until exercised nor are idiq contracts until an order is received 
business acquisition in late september  we acquired all the shares of orlando  florida based ecc international corporation ecc for million 
the acquisition further strengthens our position in the defense marketplace  broadening the scope of our core training business to include virtual simulation capabilities 
cubic defense applications has now formed a simulation systems division  enhancing our position in orlando  from which we conduct overall central florida business development and general management of key us marine corps and navy programs for our mission support business unit 
the acquisition had no impact on operating results for fiscal  as it was made within days of the end of the fiscal year 
new accounting standards in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin  which makes changes in the accounting for  and disclosures of  guarantees 
fin requires certain guarantees to be recorded at fair value rather than recording a liability only when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable 
fin also requires a guarantor to make significant new disclosures  even when the likelihood of making any payments under the guarantee is remote 
the disclosure requirements of the new standard were effective december  and the initial recognition and measurement provisions were applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  we did not have any guarantees outstanding as of september  that fall within the scope of fin in april  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin  which will significantly change whether entities included in its scope are consolidated by their sponsors  transferors  or investors 
fin introduces a new consolidation model  the variable interests model  which determines control based on potential variability in gains and losses of the entity being evaluated for consolidation 
the new standard is effective at the end of fiscal years ending after december   which for us will be as of september  we have not yet completed our evaluation of the impact  if any  fin will have on our financial position and results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources growth in unbilled accounts receivable during the year resulted in negative cash flows from operations in of million  compared to positive cash flows from operations of million in and million in cash flows from the defense segment were positive in  while the transportation segment experienced negative cash flows due to the prestige contract situation 
of the million increase in accounts receivable from operations during the year  approximately million was from the prestige project 
the payment terms on this contract were established five years ago at the outset of the contract and the customer is making payments in accordance with those terms 
however  due to the termination of the subcontractor described above  we have incurred substantial costs during that were not originally planned and are included in our claim against the subcontractor 
we expect to recover these costs late in through the adjudication process  however  the timing cannot be predicted with any certainty and it may take longer 
if we are not able to recover our costs from the subcontractor  it will take several years for cash flows from this contract to recover the additional costs expended this year 
as described in the operating section above  all of these costs have been taken into consideration in our revenue and profit margin recognition for this contract 
a portion of the amount receivable under this long term contract has been classified as non current on the consolidated balance sheet as we do not expect to receive payment of that amount within twelve months 
in addition to the prestige contract  the most significant additional cause of increased accounts receivable was a transportation systems contract with a customer in north america that was bid with unfavorable cash payment terms in a competitive situation 
this contract  which is at an early stage of completion  caused an additional million growth in accounts receivable 
however  we expect this situation to improve in as certain milestones are reached that will trigger payments from the customer 
the remainder of the million increase in accounts receivable can be attributed to the overall increase in sales volume 
in addition to the million increase in accounts receivable reflected on the consolidated statement of cash flows for  accounts receivable increased by another million from september  to september  this increase includes accounts receivable added from the acquisition of ecc of million and an increase of million from foreign currency translation 
cash in the amount of million net of cash acquired of million was used for the acquisition of ecc  as described above 
the remaining purchase price of million was paid subsequent to the balance sheet date  during the first quarter of fiscal  and was included in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet as of september  other investing activities included cash receipts from the two sales of real estate described earlier in this report which amounted to million 
in addition  million was used to purchase marketable securities  which were available for sale as of september   and for additions to fixed assets totaling million 
of this amount million was for the outfitting of our new european transportation systems headquarters located south of london  a task which is now completed 
during  we borrowed million on a short term basis to finance the working capital needs of our subsidiaries in the uk and new zealand 
other financing activities included a scheduled debt payment of million and the payment of million in dividends to shareholders cents per share 
accumulated other comprehensive income loss improved by million in primarily because of favorable foreign currency translation adjustments of million 
this leaves a negative balance of about million in accumulated other comprehensive income as of september  compared to million at september  pension plan accounting had generated an accumulated charge in previous years of million through september   but this was partially offset by a positive adjustment of million in our pension plan under funded balance changed only slightly from the september  balance of million to a september  balance of million 
a healthy return on plan assets during the year helped to offset significant growth in the net benefit obligation  caused by further decline in the discount rate used for measurement of the obligation from percent to percent 
pension expense increased from million in to million in  and is expected to remain at approximately the level in minimum funding requirements for fiscal are estimated to be million 
our net deferred tax asset was million at september  compared to million at september  of these amounts  million and million at september  and respectively  resulted from the tax effect of recording an additional minimum pension liability 
we expect to generate sufficient taxable income in the future such that the net deferred tax asset will be realized 
our financial condition remains strong with working capital of million and a current ratio of to at september  we expect that cash on hand and our ability to access the debt markets will be adequate to meet our working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
in addition to the short term borrowing arrangements we have in the uk and new zealand  we have million in unsecured short term borrowing arrangements with us financial institutions for working capital requirements which were not used as of september  the following is a schedule of our contractual obligations outstanding as of september  total less than year years years after years in millions long term debt interest payments operating leases deferred compensation subsequent to september  we commenced discussions regarding a million short term credit facility for working capital needs from a group of financial institutions 
we contemplate finalizing this facility by the end of january under the terms of a commitment letter with the agent bank organizing the facility 
critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we continually evaluate our estimates and judgments  the most critical of which are those related to revenue recognition  income taxes  valuation of goodwill and pension costs 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be rea sonable under the circumstances 
materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known 
besides the estimates identified above that are considered critical  we make many other accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements and related disclosures 
all estimates  whether or not deemed critical affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates and judgments are also based on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known  even for estimates and judgments that are not deemed criti cal 
this discussion of critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments should be read in conjunction with other disclosures included in this discussion and the notes to the consolidated financial statements related to estimates  contingencies and new accounting standards 
significant accounting policies are identified in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have discussed each of the critical accounting policies and the related estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition most of our business is derived from long term development  production and system integration contracts which we account for consistent with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa audit and accounting guide  audits of federal government contractors  and the aicpa s statement of position no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
we consider the nature of these contracts and the types of products and services provided when we determine the proper accounting for a particular contract 
generally we record long term fixed price contracts on a percentage of completion basis using the cost to cost method to measure progress toward completion 
most of our long term fixed price contracts require us to deliver minimal quantities over a long period of time or to perform a substantial level of development effort in relation to the total value of the contract 
under the cost to cost method of accounting  we recognize revenue based on a ratio of the costs incurred to the estimated total costs at completion 
amounts representing contract change orders  claims or other items are included in the contract value only when they can be reliably estimated and realization is considered more likely than not 
provisions are made on a current basis to fully recognize any anticipated losses on contracts 
we record sales under cost reimbursement type contracts as we incur the costs 
incentives or penalties and awards applicable to performance on contracts are considered in estimating sales and profits  and are recorded when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated contract performance 
incentive provisions that increase or decrease earnings based solely on a single significant event are not recognized until the event occurs 
we have accounting policies in place to address these and other complex issues in accounting for long term contracts 
sales of products are recorded when a firm sales agreement is in place  delivery has occurred and collectibility of the fixed or determinable sales price is reasonably assured 
sales of services are recorded when performed in accordance with contracts or service agreements 
income taxes significant judgment is required in determining our income tax provisions and in evaluating our tax return positions 
we establish reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and that we may not succeed 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit 
tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements and are referred to as timing differences 
in addition  some expenses are not deductible on our tax return and are referred to as permanent differences 
timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the benefit in our income statement 
we establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent deductions we have taken on our tax return but have not yet recognized as expense in our financial statements 
we have not recognized any united states tax expense on undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries since we intend to reinvest the earnings outside the united states for the foreseeable future 
these undistributed earnings totaled approximately million at september  valuation of goodwill we evaluate our recorded goodwill balances for potential impairment annually by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value  including recorded goodwill 
we have not yet had a case where the carrying value exceeded the fair value  however  if it did  impairment would be measured by comparing the derived fair value of goodwill to its carrying value  and any impairment determined would be recorded in the current period 
to date there has been no impairment of our recorded goodwill 
goodwill balances by reporting unit are as follows at september  september  in millions defense systems and products defense services transportation systems total goodwill determining the fair value of a reporting unit for purposes of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
we currently perform internal valuation analysis and consider other market information that is publicly available 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and comparisons with recent transactions 
these approaches use significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows  discount rate reflecting the inherent risk in future cash flows  perpetual growth rate and determination of appropriate market comparables 
pension costs the measurement of our pension obligations and costs is dependent on a variety of assumptions used by our actuaries 
these assumptions include estimates of the present value of projected future pension payments to plan participants  taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience 
these assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions 
the assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors discount rates inflation salary growth expected return on plan assets retirement rates mortality rates we base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on corporate long term bonds rated aa 
our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators 
the salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience in relation to the inflation assumption 
the expected return on plan assets reflects asset allocations  our historical experience  our investment strategy and the views of investment managers and large pension sponsors 
retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience 
the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect our recognized expense in such future periods 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk we invest in money market instruments and short term marketable debt and equity securities that are tied to floating interest rates being offered at the time the investment is made 
we maintain short term borrowing arrangements in the united kingdom uk and new zealand  which are also tied to floating interest rates the uk and new zealand base rates 
we also have senior unsecured notes payable to insurance companies that are due in annual installments 
these notes have fixed coupon interest rates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
interest income earned on our short term investments is affected by changes in the general level of us and us interest rates 
these income streams are generally not hedged 
interest expense incurred under the short term borrowing arrangements is affected by changes in the general level of interest rates in the u 
k and new zealand 
the expense related to these cost streams is usually not hedged since it is either revolving  payable within three months and or immediately callable by the lender at any time 
interest expense incurred under the long term notes payable is not affected by changes in any interest rate because it is fixed 
however  we have in the past  and may in the future  use an interest rate swap to essentially convert this fixed rate into a floating rate for some or all of the long term debt outstanding 
the purpose of a swap is to tie the interest expense risk related to these borrowings to the interest income risk on our short term investments  thereby mitigating our net interest rate risk 
we believe that we are not significantly exposed to interest rate risk at this point in time 
there was no interest rate swap outstanding at september  foreign currency exchange risk in the ordinary course of business  we enter into firm sale and purchase commitments denominated in many foreign currencies 
we have a policy to hedge those commitments greater than  by using foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary responsible for the commitment  typically the british pound  canadian dollar  euro  singapore dollar and australian dollar 
these contracts are designed to be effective hedges regardless of the direction or magnitude of any foreign currency exchange rate change because they result in an equal and opposite income or cost stream that offsets the change in the value of the underlying commitment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our foreign currency translation and transaction accounting policies 
we also use balance sheet hedges to mitigate foreign exchange risk 
this strategy involves incurring british pound denominated debt see interest rate risk above and having the option of paying off the debt using us dollar or british pound funds 
we do not believe that we are significantly exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk at this point in time 
investments in our foreign subsidiaries in the uk  australia  new zealand and singapore are not hedged because we consider them to be invested indefinitely 
in addition  we generally have control over the timing and amount of earnings repatriation and expect to use this control to mitigate foreign currency exchange risk
