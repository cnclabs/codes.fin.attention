item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those that impact revenue recognition and those related to capitalized software  intangible assets  allowance for doubtful accounts  allowance for obsolescence  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or the services have been provided to the customer  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in instances where the customer specifies final acceptance  revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria are met 
the company reduces revenue for estimated customer returns and allowances 
hardware revenue from hardware sales is recognized at the time of shipment 
software if a third party can install the software  revenue is recognized when shipped  with an appropriate deferral for any undelivered software contract elements 
however  if micros is the sole party that has the proprietary knowledge to install the software  revenue is recognized upon installation and when ready to go live  with an appropriate deferral for any undelivered software contract elements 
this deferral is earned when significant obligations no longer exist 
service service contract and hosting revenue is initially recorded as deferred service revenue and is recognized on a pro rata basis over the contract term 
revenue for the installation of the product  programming and the training of customers staff is recognized as the work is performed 
revenue from customer specific development work is recognized under the completed contract method 
capitalized software development costs software development costs  for software products to be licensed to others  incurred prior to establishing technological feasibility are charged to operations and included in research and development costs 
software development costs incurred after establishing technological feasibility and purchased software costs are capitalized on a product by product basis until the product is available for general release to customers upon which amortization begins 
annual amortization  charged to cost of sales  is the greater of the amount computed using the ratio that current gross revenues for a product bear to the total of current and anticipated future gross revenues for that product  or the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product 
goodwill and intangible assets on july   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 the company ceased amortizing goodwill 
on an annual basis  the company tests goodwill for potential impairment in the first fiscal quarter 
allowance for doubtful accounts micros maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
these allowances are based on customer payment practices and history  inquiries  credit reports from third parties and other financial information 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on the deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts more likely than not to be realized 
if the company determines that it will not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination is made 
foreign currency translation the financial statements of micros s non us operations are translated into us dollars for financial reporting purposes 
the assets and liabilities of non us operations whose functional currencies are not in non us dollars are translated at the fiscal year end exchange rates  while revenues and expenses are translated at month end exchange rates during the fiscal year 
the cumulative translation effects are reflected in shareholders equity 
gains and losses on transactions denominated in other than the functional currency of an operation are reflected in other income expense
