item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction we are a diversified broadcasting company that owns and operates  provides programming services pursuant to lmas or provides sales services pursuant to outsourcing agreements to more television stations than all but one other commercial broadcasting group in the united states 
we currently own  provide programming services pursuant to lmas or provide sales services to television stations in markets 
we currently have duopolies where we own and operate two stations in ten markets  own and operate a station and provide programming and operating services to a second station in nine markets  and own a station and provide or are provided sales  operational and managerial services to a second station in four markets 
our operating revenues are derived from local and national advertisers and  to a much lesser extent  from political advertisers and television network compensation 
our revenues from local advertisers have continued to trend upward and revenues from national advertisers have continued to trend downward when measured as a percentage of gross broadcast revenue 
we believe this trend is primarily the result of our focus on increasing local advertising revenues as a percentage of total advertising revenues  from a decrease in overall spending by national advertisers and from an increase in the number of media outlets providing national advertisers a means by which to advertise their goods or services 
our efforts to mitigate the effect of increasing national media outlets include continuing our efforts to increase local revenues and developing innovative marketing strategies to sell traditional and non traditional services to national advertisers 
our primary operating expenses are syndicated program rights fees  commissions on revenues  employee salaries  and news gathering and station promotional costs 
amortization and depreciation of costs associated with the acquisition of the stations and interest carrying charges are significant factors in determining our overall profitability 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of our operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  income taxes  program contract costs  property and equipment  intangible assets  investments  and derivative contracts 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the economy and or the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make their payments  additional allowances may be required 
program contract costs 
we have agreements with distributors for the rights to television programming over contract periods which generally run from one to seven years 
contract payments are made in installments over terms that are generally shorter than the contract period 
each contract is recorded as an asset and a liability at an amount equal to its gross contractual commitment when the license period begins and the program is available for its first showing 
the portion of program contracts which become payable within one year is reflected as a current liability in the consolidated balance sheets 
the rights to program materials are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at the lower of unamortized cost or estimated net realizable value 
estimated net realizable values are based upon management s expectation of future advertising revenues net of sale commissions to be generated by the program material 
amortization of program contract costs is generally computed using either a four year accelerated method or based on usage  whichever yields the greater amortization for each program 
program contract costs  estimated by management to be amortized in the succeeding year  are classified as current assets 
payments of program contract liabilities are typically paid on a scheduled basis and are not affected by adjustments for amortization or estimated net realizable value 
if we are unable to realize management s estimate of future advertising revenues  additional writedowns to net realizable value may be required 
valuation of goodwill  long lived assets and intangible assets 
we periodically evaluate our goodwill  long lived assets and intangible assets for potential impairment indicators 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on estimated future cash flows  market conditions  operational performance of our stations and legal factors 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that the net book value of long lived assets and intangible assets is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
income taxes 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
if we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income  or if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  we could be required to establish a valuation allowance against all or a significant portion of our deferred tax assets resulting in a substantial increase in our effective tax rate and a material adverse impact on our operating results 
set forth below are the principal types of broadcast revenues received by our stations for the periods indicated and the percentage contribution of each type to our total gross broadcast revenues broadcast revenue dollars in thousands years ended december  local regional advertising   national advertising    network compensation    political advertising    production    broadcast revenues    less agency commissions    broadcast revenues  net    barter revenues    other revenues    total revenues    our primary types of programming and their approximate percentages of net broadcast revenues were syndicated programming  network programming  news  direct advertising programming  sports programming and children s programming

the increase in local revenues is related to our continued focus on developing a strong local sales force at each of our stations 
in addition  for the year ended december   the events of september th had a direct impact on the revenues of media related businesses

the decrease in operating expenses also resulted from the full quarter effect of our restructuring program initiated during the three months ended march   and the restructuring costs incurred during  related to discontinued programming of local news at our stations kdnl tv in st 
louis  missouri and wxlv tv in winston salem  north carolina 
depreciation and amortization decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in depreciation and amortization for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was related to the adoption of sfas no

recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb  approved statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
prospectively prohibits the pooling of interest method of accounting for business combinations initiated after june  sfas no 
requires companies to cease amortizing goodwill and certain other intangible assets including broadcast licenses effective january  sfas no 
also establishes a new method of testing goodwill and broadcast licenses for impairment on an annual basis or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
the adoption of sfas no 
resulted in discontinuation of amortization of our goodwill and broadcast licenses effective january   however  we were required to test goodwill and broadcast licenses for impairment under the new standard during during the three months ended march   we tested our broadcast licenses for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
based on the estimated fair value of such licenses in their respective markets 
we estimated the fair values of our broadcast licenses using discontinued cash flow models 
the estimated fair value was compared to the book value to determine whether any impairment had occurred 
as a result of this analysis we incurred a pretax impairment charge of million 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at adoption and at least annually thereafter  utilizing a two step methodology 
the initial step required us to determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value  including goodwill  of such unit 
if the fair value exceeded the carrying value  no impairment loss was recognized 
however  if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeded its fair value  the goodwill of this unit might have been impaired 
the amount  if any  of the impairment would then be measured in the second step 
the second step requires us to calculate the fair value of goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to each of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit based on their fair values 
this calculated goodwill is then compared to the book value of the goodwill and an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the book value exceeds the fair value 
we determined that our designated marketing areas dmas were reporting units under sfas in connection with adopting this standard during  we completed step one of the test for impairment by comparing the book value of our reporting units  including goodwill  to the estimated fair value of our reporting units as of january  we estimated the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of quoted market prices  observed earnings multiples paid for comparable television stations and discounted cash flow models 
we performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test for those dmas whose goodwill was found to be potentially impaired as a result of the first step 
we performed the second step by allocating the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to each of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit based on their estimated fair values 
we estimated the fair values of the assets and liabilities using a combination of observed prices paid for similar assets and liabilities  discounted cash flow models and appraisals 
as a result of such testing  we recorded a pre tax impairment charge of million related to nine of our dmas and our software development and consulting company 
the total impairment charge of million related to our broadcast licenses and goodwill is reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle on our consolidated statement of operations  net of the related tax benefit of million 
sfas requires goodwill and definite lived intangible assets to be tested for impairment on an annual basis  therefore  we tested these assets for impairment as of october  by comparing their book values to their estimated fair values 
there was no impairment charge recorded based on the results of such testing 
sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
 and sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities requires that an entity recognize all derivative instruments and hedging activities as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet measured at their fair values

 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
is effective after december   and addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity 
the primary difference between sfas no 
and eitf concerns the timing of liability recognition and we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the emerging issues task forces eitf reached a concensus on issue  accounting by reseller for cash consideration received from a vendor  eitf 
eitf requires us to treat our deferred commission credits as a reduction in selling expense when realized and not as broadcast revenue 
we adopted eitf on december  this adoption resulted in a reclassification of million and million for the years ended december and  respectively

net cash flows from operating activities increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  we received income tax refunds net of payments of million for the year ended december  as compared to income tax payments  net of refunds of million for the year ended december  we made interest payments on outstanding indebtedness and payments for subsidiary trust minority interest expense totaling million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  program rights payments increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  or 
this increase in program rights payments was comprised of million related to an increase in programming costs on a same station basis  offset by a decrease in payments related to the disposition of wttv tv 
this increase in program rights payments resulted from our investment to upgrade our television programming 
net cash flows from investing activities were million for the year ended december  as compared to net cash flows used in investing activity of million for the year ended december  this increase in net cash flows used in investing activity was primarily due to the sale of wttv broadcast assets and repayments of notes receivable  offset by payments relating to the acquisition of broadcast assets  property and equipment expenditures and equity investments 
for the year ended december   we received proceeds of million from the sale of wttv tv  we made cash payments of approximately million related to the acquisition of television broadcast assets and received cash proceeds of million related to the sale of broadcast assets 
during the year ended december   we made equity investments of approximately million 
during  we made payments for property and equipment of million of which million  related to digital conversion costs 
for  we anticipate to incur approximately million of capital expenditures  of which million relates to the completion of our digital television roll out  approximately million for improvements and milllion for the news expansion program 
in addition  we anticipate that future requirements for capital expenditures will include capital expenditures incurred during the ordinary course of business and additional strategic station acquisitions and equity investments if suitable investments can be identified on acceptable terms 
we expect to fund such capital expenditures with cash generated from operating activities and funding from our revolving credit facility 
net cash flows used in financing activities decreased to million for the year ended december  from net cash flows from financing activities of million for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we repaid billion under the term loan facility and utilized borrowings under the revolving credit facility of billion 
during the year ended december   we received million related to the termination of two of our derivative instruments 
during the year ended december   we repaid a net million of indebtedness  whereas in the comparable period in  we borrowed a net million  offset by repurchases of class a common stock of million and payment of an equity put option premium of million during we closed on the sale of four radio stations in kansas city  missouri in july for a purchase price of million 
in october  we closed on the sale of our radio stations in the st 
louis market for a purchase price of million and on the purchase of the stock of grant television  inc  including the non license assets of wnyo tv in buffalo  new york together with a million note receivable issued by sinclair that holds the license assets  for a purchase price of million 
in november  we closed on the sale of our radio station in wilkes barre  pennsylvania for a purchase price of million 
these transactions generated net after tax proceeds of approximately million 
income taxes the income tax provision from continuing operations increased to million for the year ended december  from a benefit of million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   our pre tax book income from continuing operations was million and for the year ended december   our pre tax book loss from continuing operations was million 
as of december   we have a net deferred tax liability of million as compared to a net deferred tax liability of million as of december  the increase is primarily due to the adoption of sfas no 
our tax rate changed to a provision in from a benefit in because we reported net income in compared to a net loss in the effective tax rate from continuing operations decreased to from the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily because prior to the implementation of sfas no 
for our reported income in was reduced by amortization of goodwill  which was non deductible for tax purposes 
in december  the internal revenue service irs completed its examination of our federal income tax returns filed through as a result of this settlement  our fiscal year benefit for income taxes reflects a million reduction of taxes provided in prior periods 
the irs has initiated an examination of federal tax returns subsequent to we believe that adequate accruals have been provided for all years 
seasonality cyclicality our results usually are subject to seasonal fluctuations  which usually cause fourth quarter operating income to be greater than first  second and third quarter operating income 
this seasonality is primarily attributable to increased expenditures by advertisers in anticipation of holiday season spending and an increase in viewership during this period 
in addition  revenues from political advertising and the olympics are higher in even numbered years 
summary disclosures about contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments the following tables reflect a summary of our contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments as of december  payments due by year and thereafter total amounts in thousands notes payable  capital leases  and commercial bank financing  notes and capital leases payable to affiliates    hytops      operating leases      employment contracts    film liability active     film liability future     programming services      maintenance and support     other operating contracts     total contractual cash obligations    and thereafter total amounts committed amounts in thousands other commercial commitments letters of credit  guarantees investments   network affiliation agreements     purchase options    lma payments      total other commercial commitments    includes interest on fixed rate debt 
future film liabilities reflect a license agreement for program material that is not yet available for its first showing or telecast 
per sfas no 
 financial reporting for broadcasters  an asset and a liability for the rights acquired and obligations incurred under a license agreement are reported on the balance sheet when the cost of each program is known or reasonably determinable  the program material has been accepted by the licensee in accordance with the conditions of the license agreement and the program is available for its first showing or telecast 
commitments to contribute capital to allegiance capital  lp and sterling ventures partners  lp 
we have entered into an agreement with a third party  whereby the third party may require us to purchase certain license and non license broadcast assets at the option of the third party  no earlier than july  the contractual commitment for and beyond represents the increase in purchase option price should the exercise occur in or certain lmas require us to reimburse the licensee owner their operating costs 
this amount will vary each month and  accordingly  these amounts were estimated through the date of lma expiration based on historical cost experience 
risk factors we cannot identify nor can we control all circumstances that could occur in the future that may adversely affect our business and results of operations 
some of the circumstances that may occur and may impair our business are described below 
if any of the following circumstances were to occur  our business could be materially adversely affected 
united states participation in a war could result in a decline in advertising revenues 
involvement in a war by the united states could cause television advertisers to reduce or cancel their advertising spots 
advertising revenues may decline as a result of uninterrupted news coverage or other economic dislocation 
we cannot predict the amount of revenues that would be lost as a result 
our substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our operations and our ability to fulfill our obligations under our debt securities and hytops 
we have a high level of debt and other obligations compared to stockholders equity 
our obligations include the following indebtedness under the bank credit agreement 
as of february   we owed million under our bank credit agreement and had a million remaining balance available 
indebtedness under notes 
we have issued and outstanding two series of senior subordinated notes with aggregate principal amount issued and outstanding of million 
obligations under high yield trust offered preferred securities hytops 
sinclair capital  a subsidiary trust of sinclair  has issued million aggregate liquidation amount of hytops 
aggregate liquidation amount means the amount sinclair capital must pay to the holders when it redeems the hytops or upon liquidation 
sinclair capital must redeem the hytops in we are indirectly liable for the hytops obligations because we issued million liquidation amount of series c preferred stock to kdsm  inc  our wholly owned subsidiary  to support million aggregate principal amount of notes that kdsm  inc issued to sinclair capital to support the hytops 
series d convertible exchangeable preferred stock 
we have issued  shares of series d convertible exchangeable preferred stock with an aggregate liquidation preference of approximately million 
the liquidation preference means we would be required to pay the holders of series d convertible exchangeable preferred stock million before we paid holders of common stock or any other stock that is junior to the series d convertible exchangeable preferred stock in any liquidation of sinclair 
we are not obligated to buy back or retire the series d convertible exchangeable preferred stock  but may do so at our option at a conversion rate of per share 
in some circumstances  we may also exchange the series d convertible exchangeable preferred stock for subordinated debentures due with an aggregate principal amount of million 
program contracts payable and programming commitments 
total current and long term program contracts payable at december  were million and million  respectively 
in addition  we enter into commitments to purchase future programming 
under these commitments  we were obligated on december  to make future payments totaling million 
other 
our commitments also include capital leases  operating leases  sports programming  personnel contracts and other liabilities 
the amount of these commitments may be material 
our relatively high level of debt poses the following risks to you and to sinclair  particularly in periods of declining revenues we use a significant portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our outstanding debt and to pay dividends on preferred stock 
this will limit the amount available for other purposes 
for the twelve months ended december   we were required to pay million in interest and preferred dividends including dividend payments on the hytops 
our lenders may not be as willing to lend additional amounts to us for future working capital needs  additional acquisitions  or other purposes 
the interest rate under our bank credit agreement is a floating rate  and will increase if general interest rates increase 
this will increase the portion of our cash flow that must be spent on interest payments 
we may be more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions than less leveraged competitors and thus less able to withstand competitive pressures 
our ability to pay our obligations as they come due could become more difficult 
if our cash flow were inadequate to make interest and principal payments  we might have to refinance our indebtedness or sell one or more of our stations to reduce debt service obligations 
any of these events could have a material adverse effect on us 
we depend on advertising revenue  which is below historical averages as a result of a number of conditions 
our main source of revenue is sales of advertising time 
our ability to sell advertising time depends on the health of the economy in the areas where our stations are located and in the nation as a whole  the popularity of our programming  changes in the makeup of the population in the areas where our stations are located  pricing fluctuations in local and national advertising  the activities of our competitors  including increased competition from other forms of advertising based mediums  particularly network  cable television  direct satellite television  internet and radio  the decreased demand for political advertising in non election years  and other factors that may be beyond our control 
there was a dramatic decline in advertising revenue generally in although advertising revenue generally increased in over levels  it still remains below levels prior to as a result of the foregoing factors  our advertising revenue has decreased significantly from levels prior to our flexibility is limited by promises we have made to our lenders 
our existing financing agreements prevent us from taking certain actions and require us to meet certain tests 
these restrictions and tests include the following restrictions on additional debt  restrictions on our ability to pledge our assets as security for our indebtedness  restrictions on payment of dividends  the repurchase of stock and other payments relating to capital stock  restrictions on some sales of assets and the use of proceeds of asset sales  restrictions on mergers and other acquisitions  satisfaction of conditions for acquisitions  and a limit on the total amount of acquisitions without consent of bank lenders  restrictions on the type of businesses we and our subsidiaries may be in  restrictions on the type and amounts of investments we and our subsidiaries may make  and financial ratio and condition tests including the ratio of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization as adjusted adjusted ebitda to total interest expense  the ratio of adjusted ebitda to certain of our fixed expenses  and the ratio of indebtedness to adjusted ebitda 
future financing arrangements may contain additional restrictions and tests 
these restrictions and tests may prevent us from taking action that could increase the value of our securities  or may require actions that decrease the value of our securities 
in addition  we may fail to meet the tests and thereby default on one or more of our obligations particularly if the economy continues to soften and thereby reduces our advertising revenues 
if we default on our obligations  creditors could require immediate payment of the obligations or foreclose on collateral 
if this happened  we could be forced to sell assets or take other action that would reduce significantly the value of our securities 
key officers and directors have financial interests that are different and sometimes opposite to those of sinclair 
some of our officers and directors own stock or partnership interests in businesses that engage in television broadcasting  do business with us  or otherwise do business that conflicts with our interests 
david d 
smith  frederick g 
smith  and j 
duncan smith are each an officer and director of sinclair  and robert e 
smith is a director of sinclair 
together  the smiths hold shares of our common stock that have a majority of the voting power 
the smiths own the television station wtta tv in st 
petersburg  florida  which is programmed pursuant to an lma with us 
the smiths also own businesses that lease real property and tower space to us  buy advertising time from us  and engage in other transactions with us 
david d 
smith  our president and chief executive officer has a controlling interest in and is a member of the board of directors of summa holdings  ltd  a company in which we hold a equity interest and have significant influence by holding a board seat 
in addition  cunningham broadcasting corporation formerly glencairn  ltd 
is a corporation owned by carolyn c 
smith  the mother of the controlling stockholders and certain trusts established by carolyn c 
smith for the benefit of her grandchildren which own non voting stock 
cunningham holds the licenses for certain television stations that we program under local marketing agreements 
we have an option to acquire the equity interests in cunningham for a price based on the purchase price of cunningham s stations and have agreed that if we exercise the option  we would either pay any liability under cunningham s bank credit agreement or take any equity interests subject to the security interest held by the lender under that agreement 
maryland law and our financing agreements limit the extent to which our officers  directors and majority stockholders may transact business with us and pursue business opportunities that sinclair might pursue 
these limitations do not  however  prohibit all such transactions 
officers  directors and majority stockholders may therefore transact some business with us even when there is a conflict of interest 
the smiths exercise control over all matters submitted to a stockholder vote  and may have interests that differ from yours 
david d 
smith  frederick g 
smith  j 
duncan smith and robert e 
smith control the outcome of all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders 
the smiths hold class b common stock  which generally has votes per share 
our class a common stock has only one vote per share 
our other series of preferred stock generally do not have voting rights 
we describe in detail the voting rights of shares of our capital stock in portions of sinclair s proxy statement for the annual meeting of shareholders under the heading security ownership of certain beneficial owners and management 
as of february   the smiths held shares representing of the vote on most matters and representing of the vote on the few matters for which class b shares have only one vote per share 
the smiths have agreed with each other that until they will vote to elect each of them as a director of sinclair 
certain features of our capital structure may deter others from attempting to acquire sinclair 
the control the smiths have over stockholder votes may discourage other companies from trying to acquire us 
in addition  our board of directors can issue additional shares of preferred stock with rights that might further discourage other companies from trying to acquire us 
anyone trying to acquire us would likely offer to pay more for shares of class a common stock than the amount those shares were trading for in market trades at the time of the offer 
if the voting rights of the smiths or the right to issue preferred stock discourage such takeover attempts  stockholders may be denied the opportunity to receive such a premium 
the general level of prices for class a common stock might also be lower than it would be if these deterrents to takeovers did not exist 
we must purchase television programming in advance but cannot predict if a particular show will be popular enough to cover its cost 
in addition  our business is subject to the popularity of the network we are affiliated with 
one of our most significant costs is television programming 
if a particular program is not popular in relation to its costs  we may not be able to sell enough advertising time to cover the costs of the program 
since we purchase programming content from others rather than produce it ourselves  we also have little control over the costs of programming 
we usually must purchase programming several years in advance  and may have to commit to purchase more than one year s worth of programming 
finally  we may replace programs that are doing poorly before we have recaptured any significant portion of the costs we incurred  or accounted fully for the costs on our books for financial reporting purposes 
any of these factors could reduce our revenues or otherwise cause our costs to escalate relative to revenues 
these factors are exacerbated during a weak advertising market 
additionally  our business is subject to the popularity of the programs provided by the networks with which we have affiliation agreements or which provide us programming 
each of our affiliation groups experienced revenue increases in  except for upn affiliates  but this trend may not continue in the future 
we may lose a large amount of programming if a network terminates its affiliation with us 
the affiliation agreements of the three abc stations wear tv in pensacola  florida  wchs tv in charleston  west virginia and wxlv tv in greensboro winston salem highpoint  north carolina have expired 
in general  we continue to operate these stations as abc affiliates and we do not believe abc has any current plans to terminate the affiliation of any of these stations 
we have received a notice from nbc that prevented what would have otherwise been an automatic year extension of the affiliation agreement for wics wicd champaign springfield  illinois  which expired on june  recently  we extended the term of the affiliation agreement for wics wicd to april  the agreement for wkef tv dayton  ohio  another nbc affiliate  is also due to expire on april  we have no reason to believe that nbc has any current plans to terminate the affiliation agreements of either of these stations 
if we do not enter into affiliation agreements to replace the expired or expiring agreements  we may no longer be able to carry programming of the relevant network 
this loss of programming would require us to obtain replacement programming  which may involve higher costs and which may not be as attractive to our target audiences 
competition from other broadcasters and other sources may cause our advertising sales to go down and or our costs to go up 
we face intense competition in our industry and markets from the following new technology and the subdivision of markets 
new technologies enable our competitors to tailor their programming for specific segments of the viewing public to a degree not possible before 
as a result  the overall market share of broadcasters  including ourselves  whose approach or equipment may not permit such a discriminating approach is under new pressures 
in addition  emerging technologies that allow viewers to digitally record and play back television programming may decrease viewership of commercials and  as a result  lower our advertising revenues 
the new technologies and approaches include cable  satellite to home distribution  pay per view  home video and entertainment systems  and personal video recorders pvr s 
future technology under development 
cable providers and direct broadcast satellite companies are developing new techniques that allow them to transmit more channels on their existing equipment 
these so called video compression techniques will reduce the cost of creating channels  and may lead to the division of the television industry into ever more specialized niche markets 
video compression is available to us as well  but competitors who target programming to such sharply defined markets may gain an advantage over us for television advertising revenues 
lowering the cost of creating channels may also encourage new competitors to enter our markets and compete with us for advertising revenue 
in market competition 
we also face more conventional competition from rivals that may be larger and have greater resources than we have 
these include other local free over the air broadcast stations  and other media  such as newspapers  periodicals  and cable systems 
deregulation 
changes in law have also increased competition 
the telecommunications act of and subsequent actions by the fcc have created greater flexibility and removed some limits on station ownership 
telephone  cable and some other companies are also free to provide video services in competition with us 
in addition  the fcc has reallocated the spectrum occupied by television channels for new services including fixed and mobile wireless services and digital broadcast services 
among the potential new uses envisioned by the fcc for this reallocated spectrum are digital broadcast services  based on coded orthogonal frequency division multiplex cofdm technology  including mobile television broadcasting services 
as a result of these changes  new companies are able to enter our markets and compete with us 
the phased introduction of digital television will increase our operating costs and may expose us to increased competition 
dtv channels are generally located in the range of channels from channel through channel the fcc required that affiliates of abc  cbs  fox and nbc in the top television markets begin digital broadcasting by may  and that affiliates of these networks in markets through begin digital broadcasting by november all other commercial stations were required to begin digital broadcasting by may  of the television stations that we own and operate  as of february   five are operating at their full dtv power and thirty five are operating their dtv facilities at low power as permitted by the fcc pursuant to special temporary authority 
six stations have applications for digital construction permits pending before the fcc  including one of the stations which is operating at low power 
three stations have received extensions of their digital construction permits because equipment deliveries have delayed completion of construction and one station has recently received its dtv permit 
of the cunningham stations we lma  four stations are operating their dtv facilities at low power pursuant to special temporary authority  one station has a dtv construction permit that does not expire until november  and one station has a pending dtv application 
of the other lma stations  wtta and wdbb are operating at low power pursuant to special temporary authority  wdka has been granted special temporary authority to operate at low power 
wfgx has received an extension of time to construct its digital facility pending fcc action on a petition for rulemaking that it filed requesting a substitute dtv channel  and wnys has a digital application pending 
on may   the fcc issued an order and notice of proposed rule making which proposes a series of graduated sanctions to be imposed upon licensees who do not meet the fcc s dtv build out schedule 
if the rules are adopted  the stations could face monetary fines and possible loss of any digital construction permits that are not in compliance with the schedule announced in the rules 
after completion of the transition period  the fcc will reclaim the non digital channels 
the fcc s plan calls for the dtv transition period to end in the year december   at which time the fcc expects that television broadcasters will cease non digital broadcasting and return one of their two channels to the government  allowing that spectrum to be recovered for other uses 
during the transition period  each existing analog television station will be permitted to operate a second station that will broadcast using the digital standard 
the fcc has been authorized by congress to extend the deadline for reclamation of a television station s non digital channel if  in any given case one or more television stations affiliated with abc  cbs  nbc or fox in a market is not broadcasting digitally  and the fcc determines that each such station has exercised due diligence in attempting to convert to digital broadcasting and satisfies the conditions for an extension of the fcc s applicable construction deadlines for dtv service in that market  digital to analog converter technology is not generally available in such market  or or more of the television households in such market do not subscribe to a multichannel video service cable  wireless cable or direct to home broadcast satellite television that carries at least one digital channel from each of the local stations in that market  and cannot receive digital signals using either a television receiver capable of receiving digital signals or a receiver equipped with a digital to analog converter 
on january   the fcc initiated its second periodic review of its rules on the conversion to digital television  releasing a notice of proposed rulemaking 
the notice invited comments on the difficulties broadcasters face in building their dtv stations and on the interpretation of the statutory language concerning the deadline 
there is considerable uncertainty about the final form of the fcc digital regulations 
even so  we believe that these new developments may have the following effects on us reclamation of analog channels 
congress directed the fcc to begin auctioning analog channels in  even though the fcc is not to reclaim them until the channel auction was scheduled to be held in january but has been delayed  and no new auction date has been established 
congress further permitted broadcasters to bid on the non digital channels in cities with populations over  if the channels are owned by our competitors  they may exert increased competitive pressure on our operations 
in addition  the fcc reallocated the spectrum band  currently comprising television channels  to permit both wireless services and certain new broadcast operations 
the fcc completed an auction for part of this spectrum in september and has scheduled an auction for another portion of this spectrum in may with respect to the remaining spectrum  the fcc has not yet established an auction date 
analog broadcasters are required to cease operation on this spectrum by the end of unless the fcc extends the end of the digital transition 
the fcc envisions that this band will be used for a variety of broadcast type applications including two way interactive services and services using cofdm technology 
we cannot predict how the development of this spectrum will affect our television operations 
signal quality issues 
our tests have indicated that the digital standard mandated by the fcc  level vestigial sideband vsb  is currently unable to provide for reliable reception of a dtv signal through a simple indoor antenna 
absent improvements in dtv receivers  or an fcc ruling allowing us to use an alternative standard  continued reliance on the vsb digital standard may not allow us to provide the same reception coverage with our digital signals as we can with our current analog signals 
furthermore  the fcc generally has made available much higher power allocations to digital stations that will replace stations on existing channels through than digital stations that will replace existing channels through the majority of our analog facilities operate between channels through this power disparity could put us at a disadvantage to our competitors that now operate on channels through in august  the fcc adopted regulations requiring new television receivers to include over the air dtv tuners 
in november  we filed a petition for further reconsideration requesting that the fcc ensure that these over the air dtv tuners are capable of adequately receiving digital television signals 
if dtv tuners are not able to receive digital television signals adequately  we may be forced to rely on cable television or other alternative means of transmission to deliver our digital signals to all of the viewers we are able to reach with our current analog signals 
digital must carry 
while the fcc ruled that cable companies are required to carry the signals of digital only television stations  the agency has tentatively concluded  subject to additional inquiry in a pending rulemaking proceeding  that cable companies should not be required to carry both the analog and digital signals of stations during the transition period when stations will be broadcasting in both modes 
if the fcc does not require this  cable customers in our broadcast markets may not receive our digital signal  which could negatively impact our stations 
capital and operating costs 
we will incur costs to replace equipment in our stations in order to provide digital television 
some of our stations will also incur increased utilities costs as a result of converting to digital operations 
we cannot be certain we will be able to increase revenues to offset these additional costs 
subscription fees 
the fcc has determined to assess a fee in the amount of of gross revenues on digital television subscription services 
if we are unable to pass this cost through to our subscribers  this fee will reduce our earnings from any digital television subscription services we implement in the future 
conversion and programming costs 
we expect to incur approximately million in costs of which we have incurred million through december  to convert our stations from the current analog format to digital format 
however  our costs may be higher than this estimate 
in addition  we may incur additional costs to obtain programming for the additional channels made available by digital technology 
increased revenues from the additional channels may not make up for the conversion cost and additional programming expenses 
also  multiple channels programmed by other stations could increase competition in our markets 
given this climate of market uncertainty and regulatory change  we cannot be sure what impact the fcc s actions might have on our plans and results in the area of digital television 
federal regulation of the broadcasting industry limits our operating flexibility 
the fcc regulates our business  just as it does all other companies in the broadcasting industry 
we must ask the fcc s approval whenever we need a new license  seek to renew  or assign  or modify a license  purchase a new station  or transfer the control of one of our subsidiaries that holds a license 
our fcc licenses and those of the stations we program pursuant to lmas are critical to our operations  we cannot operate without them 
we cannot be certain that the fcc will renew these licenses in the future  or approve new acquisitions 
federal legislation and fcc rules have changed significantly in recent years and can be expected to continue to change 
these changes may limit our ability to conduct our business in ways that we believe would be advantageous and may thereby affect our operating results 
the fcc s ownership restrictions limit our ability to operate multiple television stations  and changes in these rules may threaten our existing strategic approach to certain television markets 
general limitations 
the fcc s ownership rules limit us from having attributable interests in television stations that reach more than using a calculation method specified by the fcc of all television households in the us we reach approximately of us television households on an actual basis or  under the fcc s current method for calculating this limit  approximately 
our ability to expand through the acquisition of additional stations in new markets is limited by these rules 
in september  the fcc commenced a broad based rulemaking proceeding to review all of its broadcast multiple ownership rules  including the national ownership cap and the method to calculate a licensee s percentage reach of television households 
changes in the rules on television ownership and local marketing agreements 
a number of television stations  including certain of our stations  have entered into what have commonly been referred to as local marketing agreements or lmas 
while these agreements may take varying forms  one typical type of lma is a programming agreement between two separately owned television stations serving the same market  whereby the licensee of one station programs substantial portions of the broadcast day and sells advertising time during such program segments on the other licensee s station subject to ultimate editorial and other controls being exercised by the latter licensee 
the licensee of the station which is being substantially programmed by another entity must maintain complete responsibility for and control over the programming  financing  personnel and operations of its broadcast station and is responsible for compliance with applicable fcc rules and policies 
in the past  a licensee could own one station and program and provide other services to another station pursuant to an lma in the same market because lmas were not considered attributable interests 
however  under the duopoly rules adopted in august  lmas are attributable where a licensee owns a television station and programs more than of the weekly broadcast time of another television station in the same market 
the rules provide that lmas entered into on or after november  had until august  to come into compliance with the duopoly rules 
lmas entered into before november  are grandfathered until the conclusion of the fcc s biennial review 
in certain cases  parties with grandfathered lmas  may be able to rely on the circumstances at the time the lma was entered into in advancing any proposal for co ownership of the station 
we currently program television stations pursuant to lmas 
of these stations  three of the lmas are not subject to divestiture because they involve stations which we could own under the duopoly rules  but either have decided not to acquire at this time or have no right to acquire  four lmas including an lma with a station we have filed an application to acquire were entered into before november   and four lmas were entered into on or after november  although we believe a valid position exists that one of these four lmas was effectively entered into prior to november  
we filed a petition for review of the report and order adopting the duopoly rules in the us court of appeals for the us circuit 
in june  the us court of appeals for the us circuit granted our motion for stay of the requirement that we divest the four lmas entered into on or after november  by august   which stay is still pending 
in april  the court held that the eight voices test of the duopoly rules was arbitrary and capricious and remanded the rules to the fcc for further consideration 
in september  the fcc commenced a broad based rulemaking proceeding to review all of its broadcast multiple ownership rules  including the duopoly rules 
the fcc has publicly stated that it intends to conclude this proceeding in the spring of terminating or modifying our lmas could affect our business in the following ways losses on investments 
as part of our lma arrangements  we own the non license assets used by the stations with which we have lmas 
if our lma arrangements are no longer permitted  we would be forced to sell these assets  or find another use for them 
if lmas are prohibited  the market for such assets may not be as good as when we purchased them and we would need to sell the assets to the owner or a purchaser of the related license assets 
therefore  we cannot be certain we will recoup our investments 
termination penalties 
if the fcc requires us to modify or terminate existing lmas before the terms of the lmas expire or under certain circumstances we elect not to extend the term of the lma s  we may be forced to pay termination penalties under the terms of some of our lmas 
any such termination penalty could be material 
outsourcing agreements 
in addition to our lmas and duopolies  we have entered into four and intend to seek opportunities for additional outsourcing agreements in which our stations provide or are provided various non programming services such as sales  operational and managerial services to or by other stations 
failure of owner licensee to exercise control 
the fcc requires the owner licensee of a station to maintain independent control over the programming and operations of the station 
as a result  the owners licensees of the stations with which we have lmas or outsourcing agreements can exert control over their stations in ways that may be counter to our interests  including the right to preempt or terminate programming in certain instances 
these preemption and termination rights cause us some uncertainty that we will be able to air all of the programming that we have purchased  and therefore uncertainty about the advertising revenues we will receive from such programming 
in addition  if the fcc determines that the owner licensee is not exercising sufficient control  it may penalize the owner licensee by a fine  revocation of the license for the station or a denial of the renewal of the license 
any one of these scenarios might affect our financial results  especially the revocation of or denial of renewal of a license 
in addition  penalties might also affect our qualifications to hold fcc licenses  and thus place those licenses at risk 
we have lost money in three of the last five years  and may continue to do so indefinitely 
we have suffered net losses in three of the last five years 
in and  we reported earnings  but this was largely due to a gain on the sale of our radio stations

our investments in other businesses may not deliver the value we ascribe to them on our financial statements or reach our strategic objectives 
our strategy includes investing in and working with other businesses  including technology and internet related businesses 
in pursuit of this strategy  we made several investments in internet related businesses in and the stock prices of publicly traded technology and internet related companies generally declined dramatically since  and specific businesses we have invested in have experienced substantial impairment of their value 
as a result  we have written off a substantial portion of our investments in these businesses 
these write offs include all of our million investment in acrodyne communications  inc  a manufacturer of television transmitters and other broadcast equipment

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates 
to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates  we enter into interest rate derivative hedging agreements 
additionally  we have entered into put and call option derivative instruments relating to our class a common stock in order to hedge against the possible dilutive effects of employees exercising stock options pursuant to our stock option plans 
interest rate risks we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  which arises from the floating rate debt 
as of december   we were obligated on million of indebtedness carrying a floating interest rate 
we enter into interest rate derivative agreements to reduce the impact of changing interest rates on our floating rate debt 
as of december   we had one floating to fixed interest rate swap agreement  which expires on june  the swap agreement effectively sets fixed rates on our floating rate debt in the range of to 
floating interest rates are based upon the three month libor  and the measurement and settlement is performed quarterly 
settlements of this agreement are recorded as adjustments to interest expense in the relevant periods 
the notional amount related to this agreement was million at december  in addition  as of december   we had two fixed to floating rate derivatives with notional amounts of million and million 
at december   we had million of floating rate debt all which was effectively converted to fixed rate debt by way of a swap 
additionally  we had million of fixed rate debt at december  of which million was converted to floating rate debt by way of a swap 
consequently  we had million of floating rate debt at december  and a increase in libor rate would result in annualized interest expense of approximately million 
we are also exposed to risk from a change in interest rates to the extent we are required to refinance existing fixed rate indebtedness at rates higher than those prevailing at the time the existing indebtedness was incurred 
as of december   we had senior subordinated notes totaling million and million expiring in the years and  respectively 
based upon the quoted market price  the fair value of the notes was million as of december  generally  the fair market value of the notes will decrease as interest rates rise and increase as interest rates fall 
we estimate that a increase from prevailing interest rates would result in a decrease in fair value of the notes by approximately million as of december  we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates related to one of our derivative instruments 
our million notional amount interest rate swap agreement does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
 therefore  changes in its fair market value are reflected currently in earnings as gain loss on derivative instruments 
we incurred losses of million and million during the years ended december  and december   respectively 
we estimate that a increase in interest rates would result in a gain of million  while a decrease would result in a loss of million
