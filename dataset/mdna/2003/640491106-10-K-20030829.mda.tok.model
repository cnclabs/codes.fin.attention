critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based on the consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that management make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates the estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
these estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following critical accounting policies reflect management s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue from sales of products is recognized at the time title of goods passes to the buyer and the buyer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership 
this is generally at the time of shipment 
where right of return exists  allowances are made at the time of sale to reflect expected returns based on historical experience 
allowance for doubtful accounts management attempts to minimize credit risk by reviewing customers credit history before extending credit and by monitoring credit exposure on a regular basis 
an allowance for possible losses on accounts receivable is established based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers  historical trends and other information 

table of contents inventory obsolete inventory is written off as it is identified 
product obsolescence may be caused by shelf life expiration  discontinuance of a product line  replacement products in the marketplace or other competitive situations 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill management assesses goodwill and other non amortizable intangible assets for possible impairment on no less often than an annual basis 
in the event of changes in circumstances which indicate the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable  this assessment may take place at any time 
factors that could cause an impairment review to take place would include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results 
significant changes in the use of acquired assets or strategy of the company 
significant negative industry or economic trends 
when management determines that the carrying value of intangible assets may not be recoverable based on the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  the carrying value is compared to a value determined based on projected discounted cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risk inherent in the company s current business model 
any impairment identified in this computation is given current recognition in any unissued financial statements

although growth of general sanitation products has slowed  management still believes that ultimately this market has large potential 
the company is experiencing competition in several of its pathogen markets but nonetheless has continued to maintain its market share 
the growth in allergen detection products is fueled by public and producer recognition of this food safety problem

inflation and changing prices have not had and are not expected to have a material effect on the company s operations 
neogen has been profitable from operations for its last quarters and has generated positive cash flow from operations during the period 
management believes  however  that the company s cash and marketable securities may not be sufficient to meet the company s cash requirements to commercialize products currently under development or its plans to acquire additional technology and products that fit within the company s mission statement 
accordingly  the company may be required to issue equity securities or enter into other financing arrangements for a portion of the company s future capital needs

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s neogen is subject to market risk exposures of varying correlations and volatilities with regard to interest rate and foreign exchange rate risks 
neogen s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to its portfolio of marketable securities 
the company has not had significant borrowings 
interest rate risk is managed by investing in high quality issuers and seeking to avoid principal loss of invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk 
default risk is managed by investing in only high credit quality securities and by responding appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
because neogen markets and sells its products throughout the world  it could be significantly affected by weak economic conditions in foreign markets that could reduce demand for its products 
neogen has assets  liabilities and operations outside of the united states that are located primarily in ayr  scotland where the function currency is the british pound 
the company s investment in its foreign subsidiary is considered long term 
accordingly  the company does not hedge its net investment or engage in other foreign currency hedging activities due to the insignificance of these balances to the company as a whole
