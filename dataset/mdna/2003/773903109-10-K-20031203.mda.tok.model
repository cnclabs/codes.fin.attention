item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states which require the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company believes the following are the critical accounting policies which could have the most significant effect on the company s reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management 
revenue recognition sales are generally recorded when all of the following have occurred an agreement of sale exists  product delivery and acceptance has occurred or services have been rendered  pricing is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
contracts and customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
shipping documents and customer acceptance  when applicable  are used to verify delivery 
the company assesses whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
the company assesses collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
the company records accruals for customer returns  rebates and incentives at the time of sale to a customer based upon historical experience 
additional accruals may be required if actual returns  rebates and incentives differ from historical experience 
the accrual for rebates and incentives to customers was million at september  and million at september   of which million at september  and million at september  was included as an offset to accounts receivable 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company records allowances for doubtful accounts based on customer specific analysis and general matters such as current assessments of past due balances and economic conditions 
additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be required if there is deterioration in past due balances  if economic conditions are less favorable than the company has anticipated or for customer specific circumstances  such as financial difficulty 
during  the company recorded an allowance of approximately million to fully reserve a receivable due to the deterioration in the financial condition of one of its independent distributors 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million at september  and million at september  the decrease in the allowance balance primarily relates to the writeoff of the million distributor receivable and million of account collections for which an allowance had previously been provided 
the remainder of the decrease resulted from the company s regular review of the allowance  considering such factors as historical experience  credit quality and age of the accounts receivable balances 
excess and obsolete inventory the company records allowances for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and estimated future demand and market conditions 
additional inventory allowances may be required if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than the company has estimated 
the allowance for excess and obsolete inventory was million at september  and million at september  impairment of long lived assets the company evaluates the recoverability of the carrying amount of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
the company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired 
the company uses judgment when applying the impairment rules to determine when an impairment test is necessary 
factors the company considers which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or forecasted operating results  a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used and significant negative industry or economic trends 
impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated fair value 
to determine fair value  the company is required to make estimates of its future cash flows related to the asset subject to review 
these estimates require assumptions about demand for the company s products and services  future market conditions and technological developments 
other assumptions include determining the discount rate and future growth rates 
during  the company recorded pre tax impairment charges of million million after tax in connection with the adoption of sfas additional information regarding the impairment charges is contained in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the financial statements 
product warranty obligations the company records a liability for product warranty obligations at the time of sale to a customer based upon historical warranty experience 
the company also records a liability for specific warranty matters when they become known and are reasonably estimable 
an additional provision for product warranty obligations may be required if actual product performance is less favorable than anticipated 
the liability for product warranty obligations was million at september  and million at september  retirement benefits pension benefits pension costs and obligations are actuarially determined and are affected by annually reviewed assumptions including discount rate  the expected rate of return on plan assets and assumed annual rate of compensation increase for plan employees  among other factors 
changes in the discount rate and differences between the assumptions made and actual experience will affect the amount of pension expense recognized in future periods 
pension expense in fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal fiscal pension expense was determined using the following actuarial assumptions discount rate of percent compared to percent for fiscal  expected rate of return on plan assets of percent compared to percent for fiscal  and an assumed rate of compensation increase of percent compared to percent for fiscal 
all other factors being equal  these changes were the primary cause of the incremental pension expense in over of approximately million 
for fiscal year  the company is assuming an expected rate of return on plan assets of percent and a discount rate of percent for determining net periodic benefit cost 
all other factors being equal  and assuming actual experience is consistent with the actuarial assumptions  the company expects fiscal year pension expense to increase by approximately million compared to fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to the change in the discount rate and includes the recognition of actuarial losses related primarily to the accumulated difference between actual and expected returns on pension plan assets 
in june  the company made a million voluntary contribution to the company s primary us qualified pension plan trust compared to a contribution of million which was related to the spinoff of rockwell collins 
in addition  while not required to contribute any amount to the company s primary us qualified pension plan trust in fiscal  the company may choose to contribute up to the maximum allowable tax deductible contribution of approximately million 
the company currently anticipates making a contribution during fiscal to the primary us qualified pension plan trust in an amount that approximates the contribution 
additional information regarding pension benefits  including the company s pension obligation and minimum pension liability adjustment  is contained in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the financial statements 
other postretirement benefits the costs and obligations for postretirement benefits other than pension are also actuarially determined and are affected by assumptions  including the discount rate 
changes in the discount rate may affect the recorded amount of the expense in future periods 
effective october   the company amended its primary us postretirement health care benefit program in order to mitigate the company s share of the increasing cost of postretirement health care services 
this change reduced the benefit obligation by million 
net periodic benefit cost in was approximately million compared to million in net periodic benefit cost in is expected to be million  which reflects the full year effect on expense of the october  plan amendment

for product liability and workers compensation  the company self insures from the first dollar of loss up to specified retention levels

the aggregate self insurance liability is estimated using the company s claims experience and risk exposure levels for the periods being valued

the liability for these self insurance programs was million at september  and million at september  litigation  claims and contingencies the company records liabilities for litigation  claims and contingencies when an obligation is probable and when the company has a basis to reasonably estimate the value of an obligation 
the company also records environmental liabilities based on estimates for known environmental remediation exposures utilizing information received from independent environmental consultants 
the liabilities include accruals for sites owned by the company and third party sites where the company was determined to be a potentially responsible party 
at third party sites where more than one potentially responsible party has been identified  the company records a liability for its estimated allocable share of costs related to its involvement with the site as well as an estimated allocable share of costs related to the involvement of insolvent or unidentified parties 
at environmental sites in which the company is the only responsible party  a liability is recorded for the total estimated costs of remediation 
future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations are not discounted to their present value 
environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing determinations of what constitutes an environmental exposure or an acceptable level of cleanup 
to the extent that remediation procedures change  additional contamination is identified  or the financial condition of other potentially responsible parties is adversely affected  the estimate of the company s environmental liabilities may change 
the liability for environmental matters  net of related receivables  was million at september  and million at september  this includes an adjustment made during the fourth quarter of to increase the environmental reserve by approximately million due to higher estimated future costs for environmental remediation near the russellville  kentucky facility of the company s former measurement and flow control business

additional information regarding pension contributions is contained in md a on page hereof 
it is expected that each of these future uses of cash will be funded by cash generated by operating activities and commercial paper borrowings  a new issue of debt or issuance of other securities 
in addition to cash generated by operating activities  the company has access to existing financing sources  including the public debt markets and unsecured credit facilities with various banks 
the company s debt to total capital ratio was percent at september  and percent at september  as of september   the company had million of unsecured committed credit facilities available to support its commercial paper borrowings  with million expiring in october and million expiring in october during october  the company entered into a new million credit facility expiring in october outstanding commercial paper balances  if any  reduce the amount of available borrowings under the unsecured committed credit facilities

should the company s access to the commercial paper market be adversely affected due to a change in market conditions or otherwise  the company would expect to rely on a combination of available cash and the unsecured committed credit facilities to provide short term funding

cash dividends to shareowners were million  or per share  in and prior to the spinoff of rockwell collins  the company paid quarterly cash dividends  which  on an annual basis  equaled per share

for additional information on the supply agreement  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the financial statements 
at september   the company guaranteed the performance of conexant related to a million lease obligation

at september  and  there were no outstanding borrowings under this line of credit 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk during the normal course of business from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the exposure to these risks is managed through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and derivative financial instruments in the form of interest rate swap contracts and foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
interest rate risk in addition to cash provided by normal operating activities  the company utilizes a combination of short term and long term debt to finance operations 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk on certain of these debt obligations 
the company s short term debt obligations relate to commercial paper borrowings and bank borrowings 
at september  and  the company had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding 
during  the weighted average commercial paper borrowings were million compared to million in there were no bank borrowings outstanding at september  at september   the carrying value of bank borrowings was million 
the company s results of operations are affected by changes in market interest rates on commercial paper borrowings 
if market interest rates would have averaged percent higher than actual levels in either or  the effect on the company s results of operations would not have been material 
the fair values of these obligations approximated their carrying values at september   and would not have been materially affected by changes in market interest rates 
the company had outstanding fixed rate long term debt obligations with carrying values of million at september  and million at september  the fair value of this debt was million at september  and million at september  the potential loss in fair value on such fixed rate debt obligations from a hypothetical percent increase in market interest rates would not be material to the overall fair value of the debt 
the company currently has no plans to repurchase its outstanding fixed rate instruments other than million of industrial development revenue bonds which the company expects to repay in january prior to maturity and  therefore  fluctuations in market interest rates would not have an effect on the company s results of operations or shareowners equity 
in september  the company entered into an interest rate swap contract which effectively converted its million aggregate principal amount of notes  payable in  to floating rate debt based on six month libor 
the floating rate was percent at september  a hypothetical percent change in market interest rates would not be material to the overall fair value of the swap or the company s results of operations 
foreign currency risk the company is exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations 
these risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries  intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
the company s objective is to minimize its exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and the utilization of foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure on transactions denominated in currencies other than the applicable functional currency 
in addition  the company enters into contracts to hedge certain forecasted intercompany transactions 
contracts are executed with creditworthy banks and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries 
it is the policy of the company not to enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
the company does not hedge its exposure to the translation of reported results of foreign subsidiaries from local currency to united states dollars 
a percent adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would not be significant to the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent for holding them 
derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are adjusted to fair value through earnings 
for derivatives that are hedges  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in fair value are either offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings 
at september  and  the company had outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts primarily consisting of contracts to exchange the euro  pound sterling  canadian dollar and swiss franc 
the use of these contracts allows the company to manage transactional exposure to exchange rate fluctuations as the gains or losses incurred on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts will offset  in whole or in part  losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure 
a hypothetical percent adverse change in underlying foreign currency exchange rates associated with these contracts would not be material to the financial condition  results of operations or shareowners equity of the company
