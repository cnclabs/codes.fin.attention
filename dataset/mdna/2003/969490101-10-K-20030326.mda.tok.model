item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to provide information relevant to an understanding of our financial condition  changes in our financial condition and our results of operations and cash flows 
our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this form k contain detailed information that should be considered in conjunction with this discussion 
overview in recent years  we have been aggressively seeking to transform cwei from a development driller of horizontal wells in the austin chalk trend to an exploration company committed to generating and drilling exploratory prospects  primarily through advanced seismic technology 
we are now concentrating our efforts toward finding and producing oil and natural gas through exploration activities  principally in the miocene trend in south louisiana  the cotton valley reef complex area of east central texas and the deep knox play in the black warrior basin of mississippi 
since our inception  we have accounted for our oil and gas activities using the successful efforts method of accounting 
under this method  geological and geophysical g g costs and exploratory dry hole costs are expensed as incurred 
companies that emphasize developmental drilling are usually not affected to a large degree by these costs  making the successful efforts method a preferred accounting method for those companies 
the alternative to the successful efforts method is the full cost method of accounting 
companies that are heavily involved in exploration activities most often select this method so they can capitalize g g costs and exploratory dry hole costs  and thereby reduce the level of volatility in their reported earnings 
as long as we remain heavily involved in exploration activities  the successful efforts method of accounting may contribute to the volatility of our reported earnings 
through discussions like this  we will attempt to explain how the application of this method affects our financial statements  and assist you in making your analysis of our performance as compared to our peers 
following  you will find a detailed discussion about our critical accounting policies and the estimates and assumptions we must use to implement those accounting policies 
application of critical accounting policies summary in this section  we will identify the critical accounting policies we follow in preparing our financial statements and disclosures 
many of these policies require us to make difficult  subjective and complex judgments in the course of making estimates of matters that are inherently imprecise 
we will explain the nature of these estimates  assumptions and judgments  and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported in our financial statements under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the following table lists our critical accounting policies  the estimates and assumptions that can have a significant impact on the application of these accounting policies  and the financial statement accounts affected by these estimates and assumptions

significant estimates and assumptions oil and gas reserves reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate depends on the quality of available geological and engineering data  the precision of the interpretation of that data  and judgment based on experience and training 
as a result  estimates of different petroleum engineers often vary  and the variances can be material 
annually  we engage an independent petroleum engineering firm to evaluate our oil and gas reserves 
as a part of this process  our internal reservoir engineer and the independent engineers exchange information and attempt to reconcile any material differences in estimates and assumptions 
we believe this reconciliation process improves the accuracy of the reserve estimates by reducing the likelihood of a material error in judgment 
the techniques used in estimating reserves usually depend on the nature and extent of available data  and the accuracy of the estimates vary accordingly 
as a general rule  the degree of accuracy of reserve estimates varies with the reserve classification and the related accumulation of available data  as shown in the following table 
type of reserves nature of available data degree of accuracy proved undeveloped data from offsetting wells  seismic data least accurate proved developed nonproducing logs  core samples  well tests  pressure data more accurate proved developed producing production history  pressure data over time most accurate assumptions as to future commodity prices and operating and capital costs also play a significant role in estimating oil and gas reserves and the estimated present value of the cash flows to be received from the future production of those reserves 
volumes of recoverable reserves are affected by the assumed prices and costs due to what is known as the economic limit that point in the future when the projected costs and expenses of producing recoverable reserves exceed the projected revenues from the reserves 
but more significantly  the estimated present value of future cash flows from the reserves is extremely sensitive to prices and costs  and may vary materially based on different assumptions 
sec financial accounting and reporting standards require that pricing parameters be tied to the price received for oil and natural gas on the effective date of the reserve report 
this requirement can result in significant changes from period to period given the volatile nature of oil and gas product prices  as illustrated in the following table 
proved reserves average price present value of proved reserves oil a mmbbls gas bcf oil a bbl gas mcf in millions as of december a includes natural gas liquids valuation of unproved properties placing a fair market value on unproved properties also known as prospects is very subjective since there is no quoted market for undeveloped exploratory prospects 
the negotiated price of any prospect between a willing seller and willing buyer depends on the specific facts regarding the prospect  including the location of the prospect in relation to known fields and reservoirs  available markets and transportation systems for oil and gas production in the vicinity  and other critical services  the nature and extent of g g data on the prospect  the terms of the leases holding the acreage in the prospect  such as ownership interests  expiration terms  delay rental obligations  depth limitations  drilling and marketing restrictions  and similar terms  the prospect s risk adjusted potential for return on investment  giving effect to such factors as potential reserves to be discovered  drilling and completion costs  prevailing commodity prices  and other economic factors  and the results of drilling activity in close proximity to the prospect that could either enhance or condemn the prospect s chances of success 
valuation allowance for nol carryforwards in computing our provision for income taxes  we must assess the need for a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  which consist primarily of net operating loss nol carryforwards 
for federal income tax purposes  these nol carryforwards  if unused  expire to years from the year of origination 
generally  we assess our ability to fully utilize these carryforwards by comparing expected future book income to expected future taxable income based on the assumption that we will produce our existing reserves  as scheduled for production in our reserve report  under current economic conditions 
if future book income does not exceed future taxable income by amounts sufficient to utilize nols before they expire  we must impair the resulting deferred tax asset 
these computations are inherently imprecise due to the extensive use of estimates and assumptions 
as a result  we may make additional impairments to allow for such uncertainties 
effects of estimates and assumptions on financial statements generally accepted accounting principles do not require  or even permit  the restatement of previously issued financial statements due to changes in estimates 
we are required to use our best judgment in making estimates and assumptions  taking into consideration the best and most current data available to us at the time of the estimate 
at each accounting period  we make a new estimate using new data  and continue the cycle 
you should be aware that estimates prepared at various times may be substantially different due to new or additional information 
while an estimate made at one point in time may differ from an estimate made at a later date  both may be proper due to the differences in available information or assumptions 
in this section  we will discuss the effects of different estimates on our financial statements 
provision for dd a we compute our provision for dd a on a unit of production method 
each quarter  we use the following formulas to compute the provision for dd a for each of our producing properties or appropriate groups of properties based on geographical and geological similarities dd a rate unamortized cost beginning of period reserves provision for dd a dd a rate current period production reserve estimates have a significant impact on the dd a rate 
if reserve estimates for a property or group of properties are revised downward in future periods  the dd a rate for that property or group of properties will increase as a result of the revision 
alternatively  if reserve estimates are revised upward  the dd a rate will decrease 
impairment of unproved properties each quarter  we review our unproved oil and gas properties to determine if there has been  in our judgment  an impairment in value of each prospect that we consider individually significant 
to the extent that the carrying cost of a prospect exceeds its estimated value  we make a provision for impairment of unproved properties  and record the provision as abandonments and impairments within exploration costs on our statement of operations 
if the value is revised upward in a future period  we do not reverse the prior provision  and we continue to carry the prospect at a net cost that is lower than its estimated value 
if the value is revised downward in a future period  an additional provision for impairment is made in that period 
impairment of proved properties each quarter  we assess our producing properties for impairment 
if we determine there has been an impairment in any of our producing properties or appropriate groups of properties based on geographical and geological similarities  we will estimate the value of each affected property 
in accordance with applicable accounting standards  the value for this purpose is a fair value instead of a standardized reserve value as prescribed by the sec 
we attempt to value each property using reserve classifications and pricing parameters similar to what a willing seller and willing buyer might use 
these parameters may include escalations of prices instead of constant pricing  and they may also include the risk adjusted value of reserves that do not qualify as proved reserves 
to the extent that the carrying cost for the affected property exceeds its estimated value  we make a provision for impairment of proved properties 
if the value is revised upward in a future period  we do not reverse the prior provision  and we continue to carry the property at a net cost that is lower than its estimated value 
if the value is revised downward in a future period  an additional provision for impairment is made in that period 
accordingly  the carrying costs of producing properties on our balance sheet will vary from and often will be less than the present value of proved reserves for these properties 
judgment regarding status of in progress wells on a quarterly basis  we review the status of each in progress well to determine the proper accounting treatment under the successful efforts method of accounting 
cumulative costs on in progress wells remain capitalized until their productive status becomes known 
if an in progress exploratory well is found to be unsuccessful often referred to as a dry hole prior to the issuance of our financial statements  we write off all costs incurred through the balance sheet date to abandonments and impairments expense  a component of exploration costs 
costs incurred on that dry hole after the balance sheet date are charged to exploration costs in the period incurred 
occasionally  we are unable to make a final determination about the productive status of a well prior to issuance of our financial statements 
in these cases  we leave the well classified as in progress until we have had sufficient time to conduct additional completion or testing operations and to evaluate the pertinent g g and engineering data obtained 
at the time when we are able to make a final determination of a well s productive status  the well is removed from the in progress status and the proper accounting treatment is recorded 
valuation allowance for nol carryforwards each quarter  we assess our ability to utilize nol carryforwards 
an increase in the valuation allowance from one period to the next will result in a decrease in our net deferred tax assets and a decrease in earnings 
similarly  a decrease in the valuation allowance will result in an increase in our net deferred tax assets and an increase in earnings 
this process requires estimates and assumptions which are complex and may vary materially from our actual ability to utilize nol carryforwards in the future 
also  the current tax laws in this area are complicated due to the impact of alternative minimum tax on the utilization of nol carryforwards 
as a mitigating factor  as long as we are actively drilling for new production  we have some tax planning strategies available to us  such as elective capitalization of intangible drilling costs  to help us utilize these nol carryforwards before they expire 
liquidity and capital resources overview our primary financial resource is our base of oil and gas reserves 
we pledge our producing oil and gas properties to secure a line of credit  called a credit facility  with a group of banks 
the banks establish a borrowing base by making an estimate of the collateral value of our oil and gas properties 
we borrow funds on the credit facility as needed to supplement our operating cash flow as a financing source for our capital expenditure program 
our capital expenditure program is dependent upon the level of product prices and the success of our exploration program in replacing our existing oil and gas reserves 
if product prices decrease  our operating cash flow may decrease and the banks may require additional collateral or reduce our borrowing base  thus reducing funds available to fund our capital expenditure program 
the effects of product prices on cash flow can be mitigated through the use of commodity derivatives 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks oil and gas prices 
if our exploration program does not replace our oil and gas reserves  we may also suffer a reduction in our operating cash flow and access to funds under the credit facility 
under extreme circumstances  product price reductions or exploration drilling failures could allow the banks to seek to foreclose on our oil and gas properties  thereby threatening our financial viability 
in this section  we will describe our current plans for capital spending  identify the capital resources available to finance our capital spending  and discuss certain factors that can affect our liquidity and capital resources 
capital expenditures we presently plan to spend approximately million on exploration and development activities during  as summarized by area in the following table 
planned expenditures for total percent of total in thousands south louisiana cotton valley reef complex mississippi other approximately of the planned expenditures relate to exploratory prospects 
exploratory prospects involve a higher degree of risk than developmental prospects 
to offset the higher risk  we generally strive to achieve a higher reserve potential and rate of return on investments in exploratory prospects 
you need to be aware that actual expenditures during may be substantially higher or lower than these estimates since our plans for exploration and development activities may change during the year 
we do not attempt to forecast our success rate on exploratory drilling 
accordingly  these current estimates do not include any costs we may incur to complete our successful exploratory wells and construct the required production facilities for these wells 
also  we are actively searching for other opportunities to increase our oil and gas reserves  including the evaluation of new prospects for exploratory and developmental drilling activities and potential acquisitions of proved oil and gas properties 
other factors  such as prevailing product prices and the availability of capital resources  could also increase or decrease the ultimate level of expenditures during credit facility we rely heavily on the credit facility for both our short term liquidity and our long term financing needs 
the funds available to us at any time under this credit facility are limited to the amount of the borrowing base established by the banks 
as long as we have sufficient availability under the credit facility to meet our obligations as they come due  we have sufficient liquidity 
at the beginning of  we had an outstanding balance under the credit facility of million  and the borrowing base was million  leaving million of availability 
during  we generated cash flow from operating activities of million  received million from the sales of property and equipment  and spent million on capital expenditures and other investments which was financed primarily by borrowing million on the credit facility 
also during  the banks increased the borrowing base to million 
the outstanding balance on the credit facility at december  was million  leaving million available on the credit facility  after allowing for million of outstanding letters of credit 
using the credit facility for both our short term liquidity and long term financing needs can cause unusual fluctuations in our reported working capital  depending on the timing of cash receipts and expenditures 
on a daily basis  we use most of our available cash to pay down our outstanding balance on the credit facility  which is classified as a non current liability since we currently have no required principal reductions 
as we use cash to pay a non current liability  our reported working capital decreases 
conversely  as we draw on the credit facility for funds to pay current liabilities such as payables for drilling and operating costs  our reported working capital increases 
also  volatility in oil and gas prices can cause significant fluctuations in reported working capital as we record changes in the fair value of derivatives from period to period 
for these reasons  the working capital covenant related to the credit facility requires us to i include the amount of funds available under the credit facility as a current asset  and ii exclude current assets and liabilities related to the fair value of derivatives  when computing the working capital ratio at any balance sheet date 
our reported working capital deficit at december  was million  as compared to a deficit of million at december  giving effect to the above adjustments  our working capital for loan compliance purposes is a positive million at december   as compared to a positive million at december  although working capital computed for loan compliance purposes differs from our working capital in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  the loan compliance working capital is useful in measuring our liquidity since it includes the resources available to us under the credit facility and negates the volatility in working capital caused by changes in fair value of derivatives 
the following table reconciles our gaap working capital to the working capital computed under the loan covenant at december  and in thousands working capital deficit per gaap add funds available under the credit facility exclude fair value of derivatives classified as current assets or current liabilities working capital per loan covenant the banks redetermine the borrowing base at least twice a year  in may and november  using the method described below 
if at any time  the borrowing base is less than the amount of outstanding indebtedness  we will be required to i pledge additional collateral  ii prepay the excess in not more than five equal monthly installments  or iii elect to convert the entire amount of outstanding indebtedness to a term obligation based on amortization formulas set forth in the loan agreement 
the loan agreement contains financial covenants that are computed quarterly and requires us to maintain minimum levels of working capital and cash flow 
we were in compliance with all of the financial and non financial covenants at december uncertainties regarding liquidity and capital resources we believe that the amount of funds available to us under the credit facility  when combined with our anticipated operating cash flow  will be sufficient to finance our capital expenditures and will provide us with adequate liquidity at least through the next twelve months 
although we believe the assumptions and estimates made in our forecasts are reasonable  uncertainties exist which could cause the borrowing base to be less than expected  cash flow to be less than expected  or capital expenditures to be more than expected 
any of these uncertainties could adversely affect our liquidity and could require us to reduce capital expenditures  sell assets  or seek alternative capital resources 
below is a discussion of certain significant factors that could adversely affect our liquidity 
adverse changes in reserve estimates or commodity prices could reduce the borrowing base 
the banks establish the borrowing base at least twice annually by preparing a reserve report using price risk assumptions they believe are proper under the circumstances 
any adverse changes in estimated quantities of reserves  the pricing parameters being used  or the risk factors being applied  since the date of the last borrowing base determination  could lower the borrowing base under the credit facility 
adverse changes in reserve estimates or commodity prices could reduce our cash flow from operating activities 
we rely on estimates of reserves to forecast our cash flow from operating activities 
if the production from those reserves is delayed or is lower than expected  our cash flow from operating activities may be lower than we anticipated 
commodity prices also impact our cash flow from operating activities 
based on december  reserve estimates  we project that a drop in oil price and a 
drop in gas price would reduce our gross revenues in by million and million  respectively  before giving effect to hedging activities 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks oil and gas prices 
oil and gas reserves are depletable assets 
we must replace our existing production with newly discovered reserves  or our borrowing base will decline 
if we fail to find new reserves to add to the borrowing base  we may not have sufficient funds to continue drilling activities 
because our focus is on exploration activities  we have a greater risk of drilling dry holes or not finding oil and natural gas that can be produced economically 
the seismic data and other technology we use does not allow us to know with certainty prior to drilling a well whether oil or natural gas is present or can be produced economically 
in  four of the six wells drilled in our core areas of south louisiana and cotton valley reef complex area were dry holes 
we cannot assure you that any of our future exploration efforts will be successful  and if such activities are unsuccessful  it will have a significant adverse affect on our operations and financial condition 
adverse changes in the borrowing base may cause outstanding debt to equal or exceed the borrowing base 
in this event  we will not be able to borrow any additional funds  and we will be required to repay the excess or convert the debt to a term note 
without availability under the credit facility  we may be unable to meet our obligations as they mature 
delays in bringing successful wells on production may reduce our liquidity 
as a general rule  we experience a significant lag time between the initial cash outlay on a prospect and the inclusion of any value for such prospect in the borrowing base under the credit facility 
until a well is on production  the banks may assign only a minimal borrowing base value to the well  and cash flow from the well are not available to fund our operating expense 
delays in bringing wells on production may reduce the borrowing base significantly  depending on the amounts borrowed and the length of the delays 
we may not be able to comply with certain financial covenants in the credit facility if the borrowing base does not increase 
the credit facility requires us to maintain a working capital average ratio of at least to  as adjusted for availability under the credit facility and the exclusion of fair value of derivatives 
we may not be able to maintain this ratio unless the borrowing base is increased due to new reserve additions  improved reserve performance  or favorable price changes 
margin calls on derivative contracts could adversely affect our liquidity 
due to the highly volatile nature of the oil and gas commodity markets  a fixed price derivative entered into as an effective hedge transaction may be out of the money at any time prior to its scheduled maturity  meaning that the current market price exceeds the fixed sell price of the derivative 
the isda master agreement between us and our principal counterparty gives either party the right to request credit support a margin call to the extent that the fair value of the derivatives exceeds specified credit limits 
currently  our credit limit under the master agreement is million 
the counterparty issued margin calls totaling million in funds paid to the counterparty for margin calls are held for our account in interest bearing trust accounts controlled by the counterparty 
at december   the fair value of the commodity derivatives with the counterparty was a liability of million 
our sensitivity analysis indicates that a increase in the underlying commodity prices would have increased this fair value to a liability of million 
based on current product prices  we have sufficient liquidity under our bank credit facility to cover our margin call obligations 
however  in the event of a significant increase in the future market prices of oil and gas commodity derivatives  the availability of funds under the credit facility may be inadequate to cover future margin calls 
if inadequate  we would be forced to obtain alternative sources of financing to avoid being in default with the counterparty 
if future margin calls are not paid when due  the counterparty may liquidate our derivative positions and seek to collect from us the resulting monetary obligation to the counterparty 
alternative capital resources although our base of oil and gas reserves  as collateral for the credit facility  has historically been our primary capital resource  we have in the past  and could in the future  use alternative capital resources  such as asset sales  vendor financing arrangements  and or issuances of common stock through a secondary public offering or a rights offering 
we could also issue subordinated debt or preferred stock in a public or a private placement if we choose to raise capital through either of these markets 
while we believe we would be able to obtain funds through one or more of these alternatives  if needed  there can be no assurance that these capital resources would be available on terms acceptable to us 
off balance sheet arrangement in may  we invested approximately million as a limited partner in a partnership that purchased and operates two commercial office buildings in midland  texas  one of which is the location of our corporate headquarters 
in addition  we loaned the partnership  against an unsecured note due in september and guaranteed up to  of partnership indebtedness 
in august  the partnership repaid the loan  and we were released from the guaranty 
our ownership interest in the partnership is before payout as defined in the partnership agreement and after payout 
substantially all of the partnership s indebtedness is non recourse  and we are not liable for any indebtedness of the partnership 
an affiliate of clayton w 
williams serves as general partner of the partnership 
since we do not manage or control the operations of the partnership or these buildings  we utilize the equity method of accounting for our investment in this limited partnership

all of the employees except mr 
williams have repaid the loans 
during  the company obtained a release from the bank and is no longer contingently liable as a guarantor of these loans

compared to the following discussion compares our results of operations for the year ended december  to the year ended december  all references to and within this section refer to the respective annual periods 
revenues oil and gas sales decreased from million in to million in due primarily to a decline in oil production and a decrease in the average gas prices received 
since most of our recent drilling activities have targeted gas reserves  a substantial portion of these decreases was offset by a increase in gas production compared to costs and expenses lease operations expenses increased from million in to million in  while oil and gas production on a mcfe basis increased 
production costs on a mcfe basis remained constant at 
exploration costs totaled million in  as compared to million in  due to the following million of abandonments dry hole costs and unproved property impairments including million related to the cotton valley reef complex area  million related to prospects in plaquemines parish  louisiana  million in west texas  million in nevada  and  in mississippi  and million of seismic and other exploration costs related primarily to the acquisition  processing and interpretation of d seismic data including million in south louisiana  million in california and  in mississippi 
since we follow the successful efforts method of accounting  our results of operations may be adversely affected during any accounting period in which seismic costs  exploratory dry hole costs  and unproved property impairments are expensed 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense decreased from million in to million in due primarily to a decrease in the average depletion rate 
under the successful efforts method of accounting  costs of oil and gas properties are amortized on a unit of production method based on estimated proved reserves 
the average depletion rate per mcfe decreased from in to in the depletion rates in were higher than normal due to the effects of lower product prices on reserve estimates  particularly on certain marginally economic properties in the bossier sands  sweetlake and south texas areas 
the depletion rates in declined due to increases in reserve estimates caused primarily by a combination of higher product prices and significant improvements in production performance attributable to a cotton valley reef complex well 
we recorded a provision for impairment of property and equipment of  during compared to million during the prospects affected by the impairment in are the sweetlake area and one prospect in mississippi 
both of the impairments were production performance related 
during  the areas affected by the impairment were the bossier sands area  the sweetlake area and the south texas area 
the estimated market values for were adversely affected due to unfavorable changes in product prices and production performance 
general and administrative expenses g a  excluding non cash stock based employee compensation  increased from million in to million in due primarily to increased legal costs applicable to a dispute with an insurer settled during the third quarter of and other increases in insurance costs  franchise taxes and professional fees

to the extent we incur losses in future periods  it is unlikely that we will record a related tax benefit due to uncertainties about the realization of additional net deferred tax assets 
compared to the following discussion compares our results of operations for the year ended december  to the year ended december  all references to and within this section refer to the respective annual periods 
revenues oil and gas sales increased from million in to million in due primarily to a increase in gas production  offset substantially by a decrease in oil production and a decline in the average oil price 
the increase in gas production was attributable primarily to our cotton valley reef complex area 
the oil production decline was due primarily to lower levels of drilling activity in the austin chalk trend 
costs and expenses lease operations expenses increased from million in to million in  while oil and gas production on an mcfe basis increased  resulting in a increase in production costs on an mcfe basis from 
in to 
in exploration costs totaled million in  as compared to million in  due to the following million in abandonments dry hole costs and unproved property impairments  including million related to certain prospects in plaquemines parish  louisiana  million related to the cotton valley reef complex area  and million related to certain prospects in the sweetlake area  and million of seismic and other exploration costs related primarily to the acquisition  processing and interpretation of d seismic data in south louisiana 
since we follow the successful efforts method of accounting  our results of operations may be adversely affected during any accounting period in which seismic costs  exploratory dry hole costs  and unproved property impairments are expensed 
dd a increased from million in to million in due primarily to a increase in the average depletion rate 
under the successful efforts method of accounting  costs of oil and gas properties are amortized on a unit of production method based on estimated proved reserves 
the average depletion rate per mcfe increased from in to in due primarily to higher finding costs and the effects of lower product prices on reserve estimates 
a portion of the increase is attributable to areas affected by the sfas provision for impairment discussed below 
we recorded a provision for impairment of property and equipment of million during to adjust the carrying value of certain proven properties to their estimated market value in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  as compared to no provision during the period 
the prospects affected by the impairment are the bossier sands area  the sweetlake area and the south texas area 
the estimated market values of these prospects were adversely affected due to unfavorable changes in product prices and production performance 
g a expenses  excluding non cash stock based employee compensation  increased from million in to million in due primarily to higher personnel costs attributable to increased levels of drilling and operating activities  and bonuses paid during to certain officers and employees 
g a expenses during include a non cash credit of  for stock based employee compensation pursuant to the requirements of financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
a  charge to expense was required during the period 
since the amount of this non cash provision or credit is based on the quoted market value of our common stock  our future results of operations will be subject to significant volatility 
interest expense and other interest expense increased from million in to million in due primarily to higher average levels of indebtedness under the credit facility  offset in part by lower effective interest rates 
the average daily principal balance outstanding under the credit facility for was million compared to million in the effective annual interest rate on bank debt  including bank fees and interest rate derivatives  was compared to in included in the computation of our effective annual interest rate for is a loss on interest rate derivatives of  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
capitalized interest in was  compared to  in during  we sold our oil and gas interests in three east texas fields including interests held through an affiliated limited partnership for net proceeds of million  resulting in a net gain of million 
we reported a net gain on the change in fair value of derivatives of million during the period in accordance with sfas see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  which was adopted effective january  this gain consists of million of net gains resulting primarily from certain gas swaps that were not designated as cash flow hedges under sfas  offset in part by a charge of million due to a default by enron north america corp  a counterparty to certain of our then existing commodity derivates 
income taxes during  we recorded an income tax benefit of million  as compared to a provision of million in see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s our business is impacted by fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rates 
the following discussion is intended to identify the nature of these market risks  describe our strategy for managing such risks  and to quantify the potential affect of market volatility on our financial condition and results of operations 
oil and gas prices our financial condition  results of operations  and capital resources are highly dependent upon the prevailing market prices of  and demand for  oil and natural gas 
these commodity prices are subject to wide fluctuations and market uncertainties due to a variety of factors that are beyond our control 
these factors include the level of global demand for petroleum products  foreign supply of oil and gas  the establishment of and compliance with production quotas by oil exporting countries  weather conditions  the price and availability of alternative fuels  and overall economic conditions  both foreign and domestic 
we cannot predict future oil and gas prices with any degree of certainty 
sustained weakness in oil and gas prices may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations  and may also reduce the amount of net oil and gas reserves that we can produce economically 
any reduction in reserves  including reductions due to price fluctuations  can reduce the borrowing base under the credit facility and adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to obtain capital for our exploration and development activities 
similarly  any improvements in oil and gas prices can have a favorable impact on our financial condition  results of operations and capital resources 
based on december  reserve estimates  we project that a drop in the price per bbl of oil and a 
drop in the price per mcf of gas would reduce our gross revenues for the year ending december  by million  before giving effect to hedging activities 
from time to time  we utilize commodity derivatives  consisting primarily of swaps  to attempt to optimize the price received for our oil and natural gas production 
when using swaps to hedge oil and natural gas production  we receive a fixed price for the respective commodity and pay a floating market price as defined in each contract generally nymex futures prices  resulting in a net amount due to or from the counterparty 
in the past we have also used collars which contain a fixed floor price put and ceiling price call 
if the market price for the respective commodity exceeds the call strike price or falls below the put strike price  then we receive the fixed price and pay the market price 
if the market price is between the call and the put strike prices  then no payments are due from either party 
the commodity derivatives we use differ from futures contracts in that there is not a contractual obligation that requires or permits the future physical delivery of the hedged products 
we do not enter into commodity derivatives for trading purposes 
in addition to commodity derivatives  we may  from time to time  sell a portion of our gas production under short term contracts at fixed prices 
we attempt to optimize the price we receive for our oil and gas production while maintaining a prudent hedging program to mitigate our exposure to declining product prices 
this strategy means that within the framework of a comprehensive hedging program  we sometimes terminate a hedge when we believe that market factors indicate that there could be an increase in product prices that we would not realize with the hedge in place 
while we attempt to make informed market decisions on the termination of hedges  this strategy may sometimes expose us to downside risk that would not have existed otherwise 
the following summarizes information concerning our net positions in open commodity derivatives as of december  oil swaps gas swaps bbls average price mmbtu a average price production period st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter year b a one mmbtu equals one mcf at a btu factor of  b based on current estimates  approximately and of our oil and gas production  respectively  for is subject to commodity derivatives 
in february  we terminated  prior to their scheduled maturity  swaps covering  mmbtu of natural gas production for the month of april at a fixed price of per mmbtu  which will require a million payment to the counterparty in april we use a sensitivity analysis technique to evaluate the hypothetical effect that changes in the market value of oil and gas may have on the fair value of our commodity derivatives 
a increase in the underlying commodity prices would have changed the fair value of our commodity derivatives at december  from a liability of million to a liability of million 
interest rates all of our outstanding indebtedness at december  is subject to market rates of interest as determined from time to time by the banks pursuant to the credit facility 
we may designate borrowings under the credit facility as either base rate loans or eurodollar loans 
base rate loans bear interest at a fluctuating rate that is linked to the discount rates established by the federal reserve board 
eurodollar loans bear interest at a fluctuating rate that is linked to libor 
any increases in these interest rates can have an adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flow 
prompted by declining interest rates during  we entered into a libor based swap in november on million of our indebtedness at a fixed price of for two years 
we use a sensitivity analysis technique to evaluate the hypothetical effect that changes in market rates of interest may have on the fair value of our interest rate derivatives 
a decrease in the underlying market interest rates would have changed the fair value of our interest rate derivatives at december  from a liability of million to a liability of million
