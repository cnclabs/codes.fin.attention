the acquired assets consist primarily of approximately  funeral insurance policies in force in the state of mississippi 
the assets were originally acquired by acadian from gulf national life insurance company gnlic on june   consisting of all of gnlic s insurance policies in force and in effect on june  significant accounting policies and estimates the following is a brief summary of our significant accounting policies and a review of our most critical accounting estimates 
for a complete description of our significant accounting policies  see note to our financial statements 
insurance operations in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  premiums and considerations received for interest sensitive products such as universal life insurance and ordinary annuities are reflected as increases in liabilities for policyholder account balances and not as revenues 
revenues reported for these products consist of policy charges for the cost of insurance  administration charges  amortization of policy initiation fees and surrender charges assessed against policyholder account balances 
surrender benefits paid relating to these products are reflected as decreases in liabilities for policyholder account balances and not as expenses 
the company receives investment income earned from the funds deposited into account balances  a portion of which is passed through to the policyholders in the form of interest credited 
interest credited to policyholder account balances and benefit claims in excess of policyholder account balances are reported as expenses in the financial statements 
premium revenues reported for traditional life insurance products are recognized as revenues when due 
future policy benefits are recognized as expenses over the life of the policy by means of the provision for future policy benefits 
the costs related to acquiring new business  including certain costs of issuing policies and other variable selling expenses principally commissions  defined as deferred policy acquisition costs  are capitalized and amortized into expense 
for nonparticipating traditional life products  these costs are amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies  in proportion to the ratio of annual premium revenues to total anticipated premium revenues 
such anticipated premium revenues are estimated using the same assumption used for computing liabilities for future policy benefits and are generally locked in at the date the policies are issued 
for interest sensitive products  these costs are amortized generally in proportion to expected gross profits from surrender charges and investment  mortality and expense margins 
this amortization is adjusted when the company revises the estimate of current or future gross profits or margins 
for example  deferred policy acquisition costs are amortized earlier than originally estimated when policy terminations are higher than originally estimated or when investments backing the related policyholder liabilities are sold at a gain prior to their anticipated maturity 
death and other policyholder benefits reflect exposure to mortality risk and fluctuate from year to year on the level of claims incurred under insurance retention limits 
the profitability of the company is primarily affected by fluctuations in mortality  other policyholder benefits  expense levels  interest spreads ie  the difference between interest earned on investments and interest credited to policyholders and persistency 
we have the ability to mitigate adverse experience through adjustments to credited interest rates  policyholder dividends or cost of insurance charges 
cemetery and mortuary operations pre need sales of funeral services and caskets revenue and costs associated with the sales of pre need funeral services and caskets are deferred until the services are performed 
pre need sales of cemetery interment rights cemetery burial property revenue and costs associated with the sales of pre need cemetery interment rights are recognized in accordance with the retail land sales provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the sales of real estate fas no 

under fas  recognition of revenue and associated costs from constructed cemetery property must be deferred until a minimum percentage of the sales price has been collected 
revenues related to the pre need sale of unconstructed cemetery property will be deferred until such property is constructed and meets the criteria of fas no 
described above 
pre need sales of cemetery merchandise primarily markers and vaults revenue and costs associated with the sales of pre need cemetery merchandise are deferred until the merchandise is delivered 
pre need sales of cemetery services primarily merchandise delivery and installation fees and burial opening and closing fees revenue and costs associated with the sales of pre need cemetery services are deferred until the services are performed 
prearranged funeral and pre need cemetery customer obtaining costs costs incurred related to obtaining new pre need cemetery and prearranged funeral business are accounted for under the guidance of the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises fas no 

obtaining costs  which include only costs that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of new pre need cemetery and prearranged funeral business  are deferred until the merchandise is delivered or services are performed 
cemetery merchandise and services trust investment earnings investment earnings generated by assets included in merchandise and services trusts are deferred until the associated merchandise is delivered or services performed 
the company is required to place specified amounts into restricted asset accounts for products sold on a pre need basis 
income from assets placed in these restricted asset accounts are used to offset required increases to the estimated future liability 
revenues and costs for at need sales are recorded when the services are performed 
mortgage operations mortgage fee income is generated through the origination and refinancing of mortgage loans and is deferred until such loans are determined to be sold in accordance with fas no 
all loans are sold to third party investors and the company does not retain servicing rights 
the amounts sold to investors are shown on the balance sheet as due from sale of loans  and are shown on the basis of the amount of fees due from the investors 
use of significant accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
it is reasonably possible that actual experience could differ from the estimates and assumptions utilized which could have a material impact on the financial statements 
the following is a summary of our significant accounting estimates  and critical issues that impact them fixed maturities available for sale securities available for sale are carried at fair value  with unrealized holding gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income which is included in stockholders equity after adjustment for deferred income taxes and deferred acquisition costs related to universal life products 
the company uses fair market values based on national association of insurance commissioners naic values  versus values associated with normal marketing pricing services 
the company considers the difference to be immaterial 
the company is required to exercise judgment to determine when a decline in the value of a security is other than temporary 
when the value of a security declines and the decline is determined to be other than temporary  the carrying value of the investment is reduced to its fair value and a realized loss is recorded to the extent of the decline 
deferred acquisition costs amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs for interest sensitive products is dependent upon estimates of current and future gross profits or margins on this business 
key assumptions used include the following yield on investments supporting the liabilities  amount of interest or dividends credited to the policies  amount of policy fees and charges  amount of expenses necessary to maintain the policies  and amount of death and surrender benefits and the length of time the policies will stay in force 
these estimates  which are revised periodically  are based on historical results and our best estimate of future expenses 
cost of insurance acquired cost of insurance acquired is the present value of estimated future profits of the acquired business and is amortized similar to deferred acquisition costs 
the critical issues explained for deferred acquisition costs would also apply for cost of insurance acquired 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company accrues an estimate of potential losses for the collection of receivables 
the significant receivables are the result of the company s cemetery and mortuary operations and mortgage loan operations 
the allowance is based upon the company s experience 
the critical issues that would impact the cemetery and mortuary operations is the overall economy 
the critical issues for the mortgage loan operations would be interest rate risk and loan underwriting 
future policy benefits reserves for future policy benefits for traditional life insurance products requires the use of many assumptions  including the duration of the policies  mortality experience  expenses  investment yield  lapse rates  surrender rates  and dividend crediting rates 
these assumptions are made based upon historical experience  industry standards and a best estimate of future results and  for traditional life products  include a provision for adverse deviation 
for traditional life insurance  once established for a particular series of products  these assumptions are generally held constant 
unearned revenue the universal life products the company sells have a significant policy initiation fees front end load  which are deferred and amortized into revenues over the estimated expected gross profits from surrender charges and investment  mortality and expense margins 
the same issues that impact deferred acquisition costs would apply to unearned revenue 
deferred pre need cemetery and funeral contracts revenues and estimated future cost of pre need sales the revenue and cost associated with the sales of pre need cemetery merchandise and funeral services are deferred until the merchandise is delivered 
also  trust investment earnings from any pre need sales placed into trust are also deferred until the merchandise is delivered 
the company  through its mortuary and cemetery operations  provides a guaranteed funeral arrangement wherein a prospective customer can receive future goods and services at guaranteed prices 
to accomplish this  the company  through its life insurance operations  sells to the customer an increasing benefit life insurance policy that is assigned to the mortuaries 
if  at the time of need  the policyholder potential mortuary customer utilizes one of the company s facilities  the guaranteed funeral arrangement contract that has been assigned will provide the funeral goods and services at the contracted price 
the increasing life insurance policy will cover the difference between the original contract prices and current prices 
risks may arise if the difference cannot be fully met by the life insurance policy 
results of operations compared to total revenues increased by  or  from  for fiscal year to  for fiscal year contributing to this increase in total revenues was a  increase in mortgage fee income  a  increase in net mortuary and cemetery sales and a  increase in insurance premiums and other considerations

liquidity and capital resources the company s life insurance subsidiaries and cemetery and mortuary subsidiaries realize cash flow from premiums  contract payments and sales on personal services rendered for cemetery and mortuary business  from interest and dividends on invested assets  and from the proceeds from the maturity of held to maturity investments or sale of other investments 
the mortgage subsidiary realizes cash flow from fees generated by originating and refinancing mortgage loans and interest earned on mortgages sold to investors 
the company considers these sources of cash flow to be adequate to fund future policyholder and cemetery and mortuary liabilities  which generally are long term  and adequate to pay current policyholder claims  annuity payments  expenses on the issuance of new policies  the maintenance of existing policies  debt service  and to meet operating expenses 
the company attempts to match the duration of invested assets with its policyholder and cemetery and mortuary liabilities 
the company may sell investments other than those held to maturity in the portfolio to help in this timing  however  to date  that has not been necessary 
the company purchases short term investments on a temporary basis to meet the expectations of short term requirements of the company s products 
the company s investment philosophy is intended to provide a rate of return which will persist during the expected duration of policyholder and cemetery and mortuary liabilities regardless of future interest rate movements 
the company s investment policy is to invest predominately in fixed maturity securities  mortgage loans  and warehouse mortgage loans on a short term basis before selling the loans to investors in accordance with the requirements and laws governing the life insurance subsidiaries 
bonds owned by the insurance subsidiaries amounted to  as of december  compared to  as of december  this represents of the total insurance related investments in as compared to in generally  all bonds owned by the life insurance subsidiaries are rated by the national association of insurance commissioners naic 
under this rating system  there are six categories used for rating bonds

if market conditions were to cause interest rates to change  the market value of the fixed income portfolio approximately  could change by the following amounts based on the respective basis point swing the change in the market values were calculated using a modeling technique bps bps bps bps change in market value in thousands     the company has classified certain of its fixed income securities  including high yield securities  in its portfolio as available for sale  with the remainder classified as held to maturity 
however  in accordance with company policy  any such securities purchased in the future will be classified as held to maturity 
business conditions  however  may develop in the future which may indicate a need for a higher level of liquidity in the investment portfolio 
in that event the company believes it could sell short term investment grade securities before liquidating higher yielding longer term securities 
the company is subject to risk based capital guidelines established by statutory regulators requiring minimum capital levels based on the perceived risk of assets  liabilities  disintermediation  and business risk 
at december  and  the life subsidiaries exceeded the regulatory criteria

in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 amortization of goodwill is precluded  however  its recoverability must be periodically at least annually reviewed and tested for impairment 
goodwill must be tested at the reporting unit level for impairment in the year of adoption  including an initial test performed within six months of adoption 
if the initial test indicates a potential impairment  then a more detailed analysis to determine the extent of impairment must be completed within twelve months of adoption 
sfas no 
also requires that useful lives for intangibles other than goodwill be reassessed and remaining amortization periods be adjusted accordingly 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
establishes an accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale that applies to all long lived assets  including discontinued operations 
sfas no 
requires that those long lived assets be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell  whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
in april  fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
under historical guidance  all gains and losses resulting from the extinguishment of debt were required to be aggregated and  if material  classified as an extraordinary item  net of related income tax effect 
sfas no 
rescinds that guidance and requires that gains and losses from extinguishments of debt be classified as extraordinary items only if they are both unusual and infrequent in occurrence 
sfas no 
also amends sfas no 
 accounting for leases for the required accounting treatment of certain lease modifications that have economic effects similar to sale leaseback transactions 
sfas no 
requires that those lease modifications be accounted for in the same manner as sale leaseback transactions 
the provisions of sfas no 
related to sfas no 
are effective for transactions occurring after may  adoption of the provisions of sfas no 
related to sfas no 
did not have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an action including certain costs incurred in a restructuring issue 
the principal difference between sfas no 
and issue is that sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred  rather than at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas no 
is effective for exit or disposal activities after december  based upon a preliminary review  adoption of sfas no 
would not have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin requires certain guarantees to be recorded at fair value and also requires a guarantor to make new disclosures  even when the likelihood of making payments under the guarantee is remote 
in general  the interpretation applies to contracts or indemnification agreements that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying that is related to an asset  liability  or an equity security of the guaranteed party 
the recognition provisions of fin are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim and annual periods ending after december  based upon a preliminary review  adoption of fin would not have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure and amendment to fasb no 
 which provides three optional transition methods for entities that decide to voluntarily adopt the fair value recognition principles of sfas no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and modifies the disclosure requirements of that statement 
under the prospective method  stock based compensation expense is recognized for awards granted after the beginning of the fiscal year in which the change is made 
the modified prospective method recognizes stock based compensation expense related to new and unvested awards in the year of change equal to that which would have been recognized had sfas no 
been adopted as of its effective date  fiscal years beginning after december  the retrospective restatement method recognizes stock compensation costs for the year of change and restates financial statements for all prior periods presented as though the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
had been adopted as of its effective date 
since the company does not intend to voluntarily adopt the fair value presentation for fasb  adoption of sfas would not have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the company 
however  pro forma disclosures required by sfas will be included in the company s future interim financial statements when necessary 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation  consolidation of variable interest entities fin  which requires an enterprise to assess if consolidation of an entity is appropriate based upon its variable economic interests in a variable interest entity vie 
the initial determination of whether an entity is a vie shall be made on the date at which an enterprise becomes involved with the entity 
a vie is an entity in which the equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
an enterprise shall consolidate a vie if it has a variable interest that will absorb a majority of the vie s expected losses if they occur  receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns if they occur or both 
a direct or indirect ability to make decisions that significantly affect the results of the activities of a vie is a strong indication that an enterprise has one or both of the characteristics that would require consolidation of the vie 
fin is effective for new vie s established subsequent to january  and for existing vie s as of july  based upon a preliminary review  the adoption of fin would not have a material impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations as there were no material vie s identified which would require consolidation 
fin further requires the disclosure of certain information related to vie s in which the company holds a significant variable interest 
the company does not believe that it owns any such interests that require disclosure at this time
