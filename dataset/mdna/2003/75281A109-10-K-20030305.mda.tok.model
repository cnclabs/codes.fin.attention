item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capitalized terms herein are defined in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements contained herein 
restatement for many years  arthur andersen llp served as the company s auditor 
in july  the company selected kpmg llp as its new independent auditor 
simultaneously  the company asked kpmg to reaudit its consolidated financial statements for the three years ended december   even though a reaudit was not required 
the reaudit was intended to provide additional assurance to shareholders  ensure the company s ongoing access to the capital markets and to avoid any possible impediment to future transactions 
as a result of the reaudit  the financial statements were restated 
for the three years ended december   the cumulative impact of the restatements reduced net income by million  of which million related to the reduction of the gain associated with the formation of great lakes in the restatement increased the net loss by million  reduced net income by million  increased net income by million and reduced first half of net income by million 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operation are based upon consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally adopted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
application of certain of the company s accounting policies  including those related to oil and gas revenues  bad debts  the fair value of derivatives  oil and gas properties  marketable securities  income taxes and contingencies and litigation require significant estimates 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that are believed reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements 
proved reserves proved reserves are defined by the us securities and exchange commission sec as those volumes of crude oil  condensate  natural gas liquids and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty are recoverable from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
proved developed reserves are volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
although the company s engineers are knowledgeable of and follow the guidelines for reserves established by the sec  the estimation of reserves requires engineers to make a significant number of assumptions based on professional judgment 
reserves estimates are updated at least annually and consider recent production levels and other technical information about each well 
estimated reserves are often subject to future revision  which could be substantial  based on the availability of additional information  including reservoir performance  new geological and geophysical data  additional drilling  technological advancements  price changes and other economic factors 
changes in oil and gas prices can lead to a decision to start up or shut in production  which can lead to revisions to reserve quantities 
reserve revisions in turn cause adjustments in the depletion rates utilized by the company 
the company cannot predict what reserve revisions may be required in future periods 
depletion rates are determined based on reserve quantity estimates and the capitalized costs of producing properties 
as the estimated reserves are adjusted  the depletion expense for a property will change  assuming no change in production volumes or the costs capitalized 
estimated reserves are used as the basis for calculating the expected future cash flows from a property  which are used to determine whether that property may be impaired 
reserves are also used to estimate the supplemental disclosure of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to its oil and gas producing activities and reserve quantities disclosure in footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
changes in the estimated reserves are considered changes in estimates for accounting purposes and are reflected on a prospective basis 
successful efforts accounting the company utilizes the successful efforts method to account for exploration and development expenditures 
unsuccessful exploration wells are expensed and can have a significant effect on operating results 
successful exploration drilling costs and all development costs are capitalized and systematically charged to expense using the units of production method based on proved developed oil and gas reserves as estimated by the company s engineers 
the company also uses proved developed reserves as the divisor to accrue the expense of estimated future dismantlement and abandonment costs 
at year end  the company had a liability totaling million for plugging and abandonment costs on its balance sheet 
this liability is shown netted against oil and gas properties on the balance sheet 
currently  the company s estimates it will spend million over the next three years on plugging and abandonment costs 
the company will adopt sfas on january  which changes the accounting treatment for these types of costs 
see note to the consolidated financial statements recent accounting pronouncements for further discussion 
impairment of properties the company continually monitors its long lived assets recorded in property  plant and equipment in the consolidated balance sheet to ensure they are fairly presented 
the company must evaluate its properties for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset could exceed its fair value 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events 
such events include a projection of future oil and natural gas sales prices  an estimate of the ultimate amount of recoverable oil and gas reserves that will be produced from a field  the timing of future production  future production costs  and future inflation 
the need to test a property for impairment can be based on several factors  including a significant reduction in sales prices for oil and or gas  unfavorable adjustment to reserves  or other changes to contracts  environmental regulations or tax laws 
all of these factors must be considered when testing a property s carrying value for impairment 
the company cannot predict whether impairment charges may be required in the future 
income taxes the company is subject to income and other similar taxes in all areas in which it operates 
when recording income tax expense  certain estimates are required because a income tax returns are generally filed many months after the close of a calendar year  b tax returns are subject to audit which can take years to complete  and c future events often impact the timing of when income tax expenses and benefits are recognized 
the company has deferred tax assets relating to tax operating loss carryforwards and other deductible differences 
the company routinely evaluates all deferred tax assets to determine the likelihood of realization 
a valuation allowance is recognized on deferred tax assets when management believes that certain of these assets are not likely to be realized 
the company s deferred tax assets exceeded its deferred tax liabilities at year end before considering the effects of other comprehensive income loss oci 
in determining deferred tax liabilities  accounting rules require oci to be considered  even though such income loss has not yet been earned 
the inclusion of oci caused deferred tax liabilities to exceed deferred tax assets by million at year end and this amount was recorded as a deferred tax liability on the balance sheet 
at year end  deferred tax assets exceeded deferred tax liabilities by million with million of deferred tax assets related to deferred hedging losses included in oci 
based on the company s projected profitability  no valuation allowance was deemed necessary 
the company occasionally is challenged by taxing authorities over the amount and or timing of recognition of revenues and deductions on its various income tax returns 
although the company believes that it has adequate accruals for unresolved tax matters  gains or losses could occur in the future due to changes in estimates or resolution of outstanding matters 
legal  environmental and other contingent matters a provision for legal  environmental and other contingent matters is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
judgment is often required to determine when expenses should be recorded for legal  environmental and contingent matters 
in addition  the company often must estimate the amount of such losses 
in many cases  management s judgment is based on an interpretation of laws and regulations  which can be interpreted differently by regulators and or the courts 
management closely monitors known and potential legal  environmental and other contingent matters and makes its best estimate of when the company should record losses for these based on available information 
other significant accounting policies requiring estimates include the following the company recognizes revenues from the sale of products and services in the period delivered 
revenues at ipf are recognized as earned 
we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts for specific receivables we judge unlikely to be collected 
at ipf  all receivables are evaluated quarterly and provisions for uncollectible amounts are established 
such provisions for uncollectible amounts are recorded when management believes that a related receivable is not recoverable based on current estimates of expected discounted cash flows 
the company records a write down of marketable securities when the decline in market value is considered to be other than temporary 
changes in the value of the ineffective portion of all open hedges is recognized in earnings quarterly 
the fair value of open hedging contracts is an estimated amount that could be realized upon termination 
the company stock held in the deferred compensation plan is treated as treasury stock and the carrying value of the deferred compensation is adjusted to fair value each reporting period by a charge or credit to operations in general and administrative expense 
factors affecting financial condition and liquidity liquidity and capital resources during  the company spent million on development  exploration and acquisitions 
fixed income obligations including trust preferred were reduced by million 
at december   the company had million in cash  total assets of million and a debt including trust preferred to capitalization including debt  deferred taxes and stockholders equity ratio of 
available borrowing capacity on the company s bank lines at december  was million on the parent credit facility and million at great lakes of which million was net to range 
long term debt including trust preferred at december  totaled million and included million of borrowings under the parent credit facility  million under the non recourse great lakes facility  million of senior subordinated notes  million of convertible subordinated debentures and million of trust preferred 
at december   the company had a working capital deficit of million which included a net hedging liability of million due to the mark to market of all open hedges 
because payments on this hedging liability are made monthly and the company will also collect production proceeds to which this hedging relates  the amount should be self funding 
during  million shares of common stock were exchanged for million of trust preferred   of senior subordinated notes and million of debentures 
in addition   of debentures  million of senior subordinated notes and million of trust preferred were repurchased for cash 
a million extraordinary gain million after tax was recorded  as the securities were retired at a discount 
since  million shares of common stock have been exchanged for million face value of debt and convertible preferred stock 
the company believes its capital resources are adequate to meet its requirements for at least the next months 
however  future cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of production and prices as well as various economic conditions that have historically affected the oil and gas business 
a material drop in oil and gas prices or a reduction in production and reserves would reduce the company s ability to fund capital expenditures  reduce debt and meet financial obligations 
in addition  the company s high depletion  depreciation and amortization rate may make it difficult to remain profitable if oil and gas prices decline substantially 
the company operates in an environment with numerous financial and operating risks  including  but not limited to  the ability to acquire reserves on an attractive basis  the inherent risks of the search for  development and production of oil and gas  the ability to sell production at prices which provide an attractive return and the highly competitive nature of the industry 
the company s ability to expand its reserve base is  in part  dependent on obtaining sufficient capital through internal cash flow  borrowings or the issuance of debt or equity securities 
there can be no assurance that internal cash flow and other capital sources will provide sufficient funds to maintain planned capital expenditures 
the following summarizes the company s contractual financial obligations at december  and their future maturities in thousands less than after year years years total long term debt  a   non cancelable operating lease obligations    total contractual cash obligations     a due at termination dates in each of the company s credit facilities  which the company expects to renew  but there is no assurance that can be accomplished 
total long term debt including trust preferred at december   was million 
long term debt of million was subject to floating interest rates of which certain amounts have interest swap agreements and million of debt had a fixed interest rate

cash flow the company s principal sources of cash are operating cash flow and bank borrowings 
the company s cash flow is highly dependent on oil and gas prices 
the company has entered into hedging agreements covering approximately  and of its anticipated production from proved reserves for  and  respectively 
decreases in prices and lower production at certain properties reduced cash flow sharply in and and resulted in a reduction of the company s borrowing base 
simultaneously  the company sharply reduced its development and exploration spending 
the million of capital expenditures for  excluding acquisitions was funded with internal cash flow 
the amount expended replaced of production 
in the absence of price revisions  net reserves added during the year replaced of production 
the million capital budget  which excludes acquisitions  is expected to increase production and to expand the reserve base 
based on current projections  oil and gas futures prices and the company s hedge position  the capital program is expected to be funded with approximately of internal cash flow 
net cash provided by operations in  and was million  million  and million respectively 
in  cash flow from operations increased as higher prices and lower interest expense more than offset increasing operating and exploration expenses 
in  cash flow from operations decreased with lower prices and volumes  higher exploration and general and administrative costs  somewhat offset by lower interest and direct operating costs 
net cash used in investing in  and was million  million and million respectively 
in  million of additions to oil and gas properties were offset by million proceeds from sales of assets and million of ipf repayments 
the period included million of additions to oil and gas properties and million of ipf investments  partially offset by million of ipf receipts and million of asset sales 
the period included million of additions to oil and gas properties and million of ipf investments partially offset by million of ipf receipts 
net cash used in financing to repay debt in  and was million  million and million respectively 
historically  sources of financing have been primarily bank borrowings and capital raised through equity and debt offerings 
during  recourse debt decreased million and total debt including trust preferred decreased million 
the reduction in debt was the result of applying excess internal cash flow and proceeds from asset sales to debt repayment and exchanges of common stock for fixed income securities 
during  recourse debt increased by million and total debt including trust preferred decreased by million 
the reduction in debt was the result of applying excess internal cash flow  proceeds from asset sales and exchanges of common stock for fixed income securities 
during  recourse debt increased million and total debt including trust preferred decreased by million 
recourse debt increased due to the retirement of the ipf credit facility and the repurchase of fixed income securities with borrowing under the parent credit facility 
capital requirements during  million of capital was expended  primarily on development projects 
the capital program  excluding acquisitions  was funded with approximately of net cash flow from operations 
the company manages its capital budget with the goal of fully funding it with internal cash flow 
the capital budget of million is expected to increase production and expand the reserve base by more than replacing production 
development and exploration activities are highly discretionary  and  for the foreseeable future  management expects such activities to be maintained at levels equal to or below internal cash flow 
see business development and exploration activities 
banking the company maintains two separate revolving credit facilities  a million parent facility and a million great lakes facility of which is consolidated at range 
in december  the ipf credit facility was retired with borrowings under the parent credit facility 
each facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of the borrower 
the great lakes facility is non recourse to range 
as great lakes is owned  half of its borrowings are consolidated in range s financial statements 
availability under the facilities is subject to borrowing bases set by the banks semi annually and in certain other circumstances 
the borrowing bases are dependent on a number of factors  primarily the lenders assessment of future cash flows 
redeterminations require approval of of the lenders  increases require unanimous approval 
at march   a million borrowing base was in effect at range of which million was available and a million borrowing base was in effect at great lakes  of which million was available 
hedging oil and gas prices the company regularly enters into hedging agreements to reduce the impact of oil and gas price fluctuations on its operations 
the company s current policy  when futures prices justify  is to hedge between and of projected production on a rolling to month basis 
at december   hedges were in place covering bcf of gas at prices averaging per mcf and million barrels of oil at prices averaging per barrel 
the hedges fair value  represented by the estimated amount that would be realized or payable on termination  based on contract versus nymex prices  approximated a pretax loss of million at december  the contracts expire monthly through december and cover approximately of anticipated production from proved reserves  of production and a minor amount of production 
gains or losses on open and closed hedging transactions are determined as the difference between the contract price and a reference price  generally closing prices on the nymex 
transaction gains and losses are determined monthly and are included as increases or decreases on oil and gas revenues in the period the hedged production is sold 
changes in the value of the ineffective portion of all open hedges is recognized in earnings quarterly 
pre tax losses relating to hedging in and were million and million  respectively 
a hedging gain of million was realized in over the last three years  the company has recorded a cumulative pre tax hedging loss of million 
when combined with the million unrealized pre tax loss at year end  this results in a cumulative net loss of million 
since  unrealized gains or losses on hedging positions are recorded at an estimate of fair value based on a comparison of the contract price and a reference price  generally nymex  on the company s balance sheet as oci  a component of stockholders equity 
due to additional hedging activity and rising prices  the fair value on march  was a loss of million 
interest rates at december   the company had million of debt including trust preferred outstanding 
of this amount  million bears interest at fixed rates averaging 
senior debt and non recourse debt totaling million bears interest at floating rates  which averaged at year end  excluding interest rate swaps 
at december   great lakes had million subject to interest rate swap agreements  of which is consolidated at range 
these swaps consist of five agreements totaling million at an average rate of which expire in june  two agreements totaling million at rates of which expire in may and two agreements of million each at an average rate of which expire in december the day libor rate on december  was 
a increase in short term interest rates on the floating rate debt outstanding at december  would cost the company approximately million in additional annual interest  net of swaps 
capital restructuring program the company took a number of steps beginning in to strengthen its financial position 
these steps included the sale of assets and the exchange of common stock for fixed income securities 
these initiatives have helped reduce parent company bank debt to million and total debt including trust preferred to million at december  while the company believes its financial position has stabilized  management believes its leverage remains too high 
the company believes it should further reduce debt as a percentage of its capitalization 
the company currently believes it has sufficient liquidity and cash flow to meet its obligations for the next months  however  a drop in oil and gas prices or a reduction in production or reserves would reduce the company s ability to fund capital expenditures and meet its financial obligations 
inflation and changes in prices the company s revenues  the value of its assets  its ability to obtain bank loans or additional capital on attractive terms have been and will continue to be affected by changes in oil and gas prices 
oil and gas prices are subject to significant fluctuations that are beyond the company s ability to control or predict 
during  the company received an average of per barrel of oil and per mcf of gas after hedging 
although certain of the company s costs and expenses are affected by the general inflation  inflation does not normally have a significant effect on the company 
however  industry specific inflationary pressures built up over an month period in and due to favorable conditions in the industry 
during  the company experienced a slight decline in certain drilling and operational costs when compared to the prior year 
the company expects an increase in these costs for increases in commodity prices can cause inflationary pressures specific to the industry to also increase

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about the company s potential exposure to market risks 
the term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil and gas prices and interest rates 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses  but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses 
this forward looking information provides indicators of how the company s views and manages its ongoing market risk exposures 
all of the company s market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading 
commodity price risk 
the company s major market risk is exposure to oil and gas prices 
realized prices are primarily driven by worldwide prices for oil and spot market prices for north american gas production 
oil and gas prices have been volatile and unpredictable for many years 
the company periodically enters hedging arrangements with respect to oil and gas production from proved reserves 
pursuant to these swaps  range receives a fixed price for its production and pays market prices to the counterparty 
hedging is intended to reduce the impact of oil and gas price fluctuations 
realized gains and losses are generally recognized in oil and gas revenues when the associated production occurs 
starting in  gains or losses on open contracts are recorded either in current period income or other comprehensive income oci 
the gains and losses realized as a result of hedging are substantially offset in the cash market when the commodity is delivered 
range does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
as of december   range had oil and gas hedges in place covering bcf of gas and million barrels of oil 
their fair value  represented by the estimated amount that would be realized upon termination  based on contract versus nymex prices  approximated a net pre tax loss of million at that date 
these contracts expire monthly through december and cover approximately  and of anticipated production from proved reserves for  and  respectively 
gains or losses on open and closed hedging transactions are determined as the difference between the contract price and a reference price  generally closing prices on the nymex 
transaction gains and losses are determined monthly and are included as increases or decreases to oil and gas revenues in the period the hedged production is sold 
any ineffective portion of such hedges is recognized in earnings as it occurs 
net pre tax losses relating to these derivatives in and were million and million  respectively 
a gain of million was recorded in effective january   the unrealized gains losses on these hedging positions were recorded at an estimate of the fair value based on a comparison of the contract price and a reference price  generally nymex  on the company s balance sheet as oci  a component of stockholders equity 
the company had hedge agreements with enron for  mmbtus per day  at per mmbtu for the first three contract months of based on accounting requirements  the company recorded an allowance for bad debts at year end of million  offset by a  ineffective gain included in income and million gain included in oci at year end related to these amounts due from enron 
the gain included in oci at year end was included in income in the first quarter of the last of the enron contracts expired in march in  a reduction in oil and gas prices  excluding amounts fixed through hedging transactions  would have reduced revenue by million 
if oil and gas futures prices at december  had declined by  the unrealized hedging loss at that date would have decreased or million 
interest rate risk 
at december   the company had million of debt including trust preferred outstanding 
of this amount  million bears interest at fixed rates averaging 
senior debt and non recourse debt totaling million bears interest at floating rates  excluding interest rate swaps  which averaged at that date 
at december   great lakes had interest rate swap agreements totaling million  of which is consolidated by range 
five agreements totaling million at an average rate of expire in june two agreements totaling million at rates of expire in may two agreements of million each at expire in december on december   the day libor rate was 
a decrease in short term interest rates on the floating rate debt outstanding net of amounts fixed through hedging transactions at december  would cost the company approximately million in additional annual interest
