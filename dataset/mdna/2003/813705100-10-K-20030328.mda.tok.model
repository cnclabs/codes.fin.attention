we recognized no income tax expense or tax benefit for either or we believe it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets of million at december  will be realized 
the computations of our deferred tax assets and valuation allowance are based on taxable income we expect to earn on government contracts  commercial products  and projected interest income over the next three years 
future taxable income of million is required to realize the million deferred tax asset at december  we had total net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million at december  of these carryforwards  million relates to stock option exercises

critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of any contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
management regularly reviews its estimates and assumptions  which are based on historical factors and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions  estimates  or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
our revenue is derived from two primary sources product and services revenue which includes revenue for software licenses  hardware  royalties  and maintenance for providing product upgrades and customer support  and advanced technology contract revenue 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as modified by sop revenue from products is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collection is probable 
subscription revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the subscription period 
maintenance revenue for providing product upgrades and customer support is deferred and recognized ratably over the service period 
for arrangements with multiple elements we allocate revenue to the various elements based on the fair value of each element sold 
we determine the fair value of each element based on its selling price when sold separately 
evidence of fair value includes the approved price list and discount schedule and the actual prices charged for comparable arrangements 
these price lists and discount schedules may change from time to time in response to factors including market conditions  value of services and product provided and competitive positioning 
historically  we have not offered significant discounts off of our list prices 
further  it is our policy that our distributors and resellers are not allowed to hold inventory 
advanced technology contract revenues for cost plus fixed fee contracts are recognized on the basis of costs incurred during the period plus the fee earned 
award fees are recognized based upon the percentage of completion and forecasted profit in accordance with sop accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
a provision is made for the estimated loss  if any  on the contracts in the period the loss becomes probable 
historically  we have not experienced losses on advanced technology contracts 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we make estimates regarding the collectibility of our accounts receivables 
when we evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts  we closely analyze specific accounts receivable balances  customer creditworthiness  changes in our customer payment cycles  and current economic trends 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
deferred tax assets 
the computations of our deferred tax asset and valuation allowance are based on taxable income we expect to earn on government contracts  commercial products  and projected interest income over the next three years 
we believe this is a conservative approach in determining the deferred tax asset that may be realized 
the risk factors noted above in certain factors that may affect future results  could adversely affect our ability to generate future taxable income  thereby also adversely impacting our ability to realize the deferred tax asset 

table of contents inflation to date  we have not been significantly affected by inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not have any material exposure to quantitative and qualitative market risks because we do not own any risk sensitive financial instruments 
we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  including bank time deposits and commercial paper 
investments in fixed rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have seen a decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
our investment securities are held for purposes other than trading
