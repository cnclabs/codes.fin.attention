item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition critical accounting policies general a comprehensive enumeration of the significant accounting policies of dr horton  inc and subsidiaries is presented in note a to the accompanying financial statements as of september  and  and for the years ended september   and each of our accounting policies has been chosen based upon current authoritative literature that collectively comprises generally accepted accounting principles gaap for public companies operating in the united states of america 
in instances where alternative methods of accounting are permissible under gaap  we have chosen the method that most appropriately reflects the nature of our business  the results of our operations and our financial condition  and have consistently applied those methods over each of the periods presented in the financial statements 
the audit committee of our board of directors has reviewed and approved the accounting policies selected 
basis of presentation our financial statements include the accounts of dr horton  inc and all of its majority owned or controlled subsidiaries 
all significant intercompany accounts  transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation 
we have also consolidated certain variable interest entities from which we are purchasing lots under option purchase contracts  under the requirements of interpretation no 
issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb 
segment information our reportable business segments consist of homebuilding and financial services 
our homebuilding segment derives the majority of its revenue from constructing and selling single family housing in states and markets throughout the united states 
the financial services segment generates revenue by originating and selling mortgage loans and by collecting fees for title insurance and closing services in many of the same markets 
we have no foreign subsidiaries or operations 
revenue recognition we recognize homebuilding revenues when a home closes and title to and possession of the property are transferred to the buyer 
virtually all of our homebuilding revenues are received in cash within a day or two of closing 
we include amounts in transit from title companies at the end of each reporting period in homebuilding cash 
when we execute a sales contract with our home buyers  or when we require advance payment from home buyers for custom changes  upgrades or options related to their homes  we record the cash deposits as liabilities until the homes are closed or the contracts are canceled 
we either retain or refund to the home buyer deposits on canceled sales contracts  depending upon the applicable provisions of the contract 
we recognize financial services revenues associated with our title operations as homes are closed  closing services are rendered and title insurance policies are issued  all of which generally occur simultaneously as each home is closed 
we recognize the majority of the revenues associated with our mortgage loan operations when the mortgage loans and related servicing rights are sold to third party investors 
we earn mortgage loan origination fees when we close and fund the loans associated with the homes financed 
we defer the earned origination fees  net of direct origination costs  and recognize them as revenues  along with the associated gains or losses on the sales of the loans and related servicing rights  when the loans are sold to third party investors 
all of the financial services mortgage loans and related servicing rights are sold to third party investors 
all of the underwriting risk associated with title insurance policies is transferred to third party insurers 
inventories we use the specific identification method for the purpose of accumulating costs associated with home construction 
we state inventories at the lower of historical cost or fair value in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
in addition to the costs of direct land acquisition  land development and home construction  inventory costs include interest  real estate taxes and direct overhead costs incurred during development and home construction 
applicable direct overhead costs that we incur after development projects or homes are substantially complete are charged to selling  general and administrative sg a expense as incurred 
all indirect overhead costs  such as construction superintendents compensation  advertising and builder s risk insurance are either charged to sg a expense as incurred or  in the case of builder s risk insurance  amortized to sg a expense over the applicable policy periods 

table of contents we amortize to cost of sales for homes closed all applicable land acquisition  land development and related costs both incurred and estimated to be incurred based upon the total number of homes expected to be closed in each project 
any changes to the estimated total development costs subsequent to the initial home closings in a project are generally allocated on a pro rata basis to the remaining homes in the project 
when a home is closed  we usually have not yet recorded and paid all incurred costs necessary to complete the home 
each month we record as a liability and as a charge to cost of sales the amount we estimate will ultimately be paid related to completed homes that have been closed as of the end of that month 
we compare our home construction budgets to actual recorded costs to estimate the additional costs needed to complete each closed home 
we monitor the accuracy of each month s accrual by comparing actual costs incurred on closed homes in subsequent months to the amount we accrued 
although actual costs to complete in the future could differ from our current estimate  our method has historically produced consistently accurate estimates of actual costs to complete closed homes 
each quarter  we review all components of our inventory for the purpose of determining whether recorded costs and costs required to complete each home or project are recoverable 
if our review indicates that an impairment loss is required under the sfas no 
guidelines  we estimate and record such loss to cost of sales in that quarter 
to date  such impairment losses have occurred primarily in markets that we have chosen to abandon  and have been insignificant in the aggregate 
fair value estimation under sfas no 
involves management estimates of future revenues and costs and  due to uncertainties in the estimation process  actual results could differ from such estimates 
warranty costs warranty reserves have been established by charging cost of sales and crediting a warranty liability for each home closed 
the amounts charged are estimated by management to be adequate to cover expected warranty related costs for materials and labor required under one and ten year warranty obligation periods 
the one year warranty is comprehensive for all parts and labor  the ten year period is for major construction defects 
our warranty cost accruals are based upon our historical warranty cost experience in each market in which we operate and are adjusted as appropriate to reflect qualitative risks associated with the type of homes we build and the geographic areas in which we build them 
actual future warranty costs could differ from our currently estimated amounts 
litigation reserves litigation reserves have been established for estimated amounts based on an actuarial analysis of our past history of claims 
we have  and require the majority of our subcontractors to have  general liability insurance that protects us against a portion of our risk of loss from construction related claims 
we reserve for costs to cover our self insured retentions and deductible amounts under those policies and for any costs in excess of our coverage limits 
because of the high degree of judgment required in determining these estimated reserve amounts  actual future litigation costs could differ from our currently estimated amounts 
interest rate swaps we have two interest rate swap agreements with a major united states bank under which we receive each quarter the london inter bank offered rate libor and pay a fixed amount that averages on a total notional amount of million 
we entered into both of the ten year swap contracts in because we were unwilling to buy out the bank s current right to cancel each swap during any quarter in which libor exceeds  we chose not to designate the swaps as cash flow hedges under sfas no 
 which we adopted on october  as a result  even though they still protect us to some extent from increases in variable interest rates associated with our revolving credit facility  we are required to record the changes in their market value in our income statement each quarter 
at the end of each quarter  the swaps market value will have changed depending upon the market s current anticipation of quarterly libor rate levels from the present until the swaps maturity in the swaps market values generally vary directly with changes in anticipated future libor rates 
we recorded a gain of million during this fiscal year which reduced the liability associated with our interest rate swaps to million at september   from million at september  the liability is a result of declines in short term interest rates in past years that resulted in a decline in the swaps market value 
we cannot predict the changes in either future libor rates or the market values of our swaps 
any future reductions in anticipated libor rates could result in corresponding future reductions in their market value and charges to our income statements 

table of contents similarly  any future increases in anticipated libor rates could result in corresponding future increases in their market value and increases in our reported earnings 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  due to increases in anticipated libor rates  their market value increased by million  requiring us to record an increase in earnings before income taxes of that amount 
by their maturity in  the swaps market values will be zero  so all of the current million liability will have been added back to earnings by then  offsetting at least partially any amounts we will have been required to pay to the counter party during that time 
goodwill we adopted sfas no 
at the beginning of fiscal under its provisions  we are no longer permitted to amortize goodwill to earnings 
such amounts are recorded on our balance sheet under the caption excess of cost over net assets acquired and  in our homebuilding segment  totaled million at september  sfas no 
requires companies to periodically assess recorded goodwill amounts for the purpose of determining whether any impairments have occurred and need to be recorded 
we have measured the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model and determined that the fair value of our reporting units was greater than their book value and therefore no impairment of goodwill existed 
we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining balance of goodwill may not be recoverable 
the goodwill assessment procedures required by sfas no 
require management to make comprehensive estimates of future revenues and costs and due to the uncertainties associated with such estimates  actual results could differ from such estimates 
stock based compensation with the approval of a committee consisting of independent members of our board of directors  we occasionally issue to employees options to purchase our common stock 
the committee approves grants only out of amounts remaining available for grant from amounts formally authorized by our common stockholders 
we grant approved options with strike prices equal to the market price of the common stock on the date of the option grant 
the majority of the options granted vest ratably over a ten year period 
we account for options under the provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and  accordingly  recognize no compensation expense for the grants 
sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation  sfas no 
and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
 sfas no 
require us to disclose the effects on net income and diluted net income per share had we recorded compensation expense in accordance with sfas no 
the sfas no 
requirements applied only to options granted after its effective date 
if we had used the black scholes formula for valuing option grants made after our adoption of sfas no 
 our net income would have been million  million and million less than reported amounts for fiscal  and  respectively  and diluted net income per share would have been less than the reported amounts for fiscal and and less in fiscal for the present  we have chosen to continue our current method of accounting for stock options until the fasb and or the securities and exchange commission sec have formalized and revised requirements for accounting for stock options 
when they do  we will promptly adopt whatever new accounting methods are required 
consolidation of variable interest entities in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
fin provides guidance for the financial accounting and reporting of interests in certain variable interest entities 
fin clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  to certain business entities that either have equity investors with no voting rights or have equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entities to support their activities 
fin requires consolidation of such entities by any company that is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the entities activities or is entitled to receive a majority of the entities residual returns or both 
we have chosen to fully adopt the provisions of fin for all variable interest entities as of september  in the ordinary course of business  we enter into land and lot option purchase contracts in order to procure land or lots for the construction of homes 
under such option purchase contracts  we will fund a stated deposit in consideration for the right to purchase land or lots at a future point in time with predetermined terms 
under the terms of the option purchase contracts  most of our option deposits are non refundable 
certain non refundable deposits are deemed to create a variable interest in a variable interest entity under the 
table of contents requirements of fin as such  certain of our option purchase contracts result in the acquisition of a variable interest in the entity holding the land parcel under option 
the land sellers are not required to provide to us the financial information of the variable interest entities 
therefore  when our requests for financial information are denied by the land sellers  certain assumptions about the assets and liabilities are required 
in most cases  the fair value of the assets of the consolidated entities have been assumed to be the contractual purchase price of the land or lots we are buying 
in these cases  the only asset the entity is assumed to hold is the land or lots that we are buying with the related offset being recorded as minority interest for the assumed third party investment in the variable interest entity 
creditors  if any  of these variable interest entities have no recourse against us 
results of operations consolidated we provide homebuilding services in states and markets through our homebuilding divisions 
through our financial services operations  we also provide mortgage banking and title agency services in many of these same markets 
on february   schuler homes  inc schuler merged into dr horton  inc with dr horton  inc 
continuing as the surviving corporation 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  consolidated revenues increased to  million in from  million in  primarily due to increases in both home sales and financial services revenues 
approximately million of the increase in homebuilding revenues was attributable to fiscal revenues generated by schuler prior to the february  anniversary date of the acquisition 
income before income taxes increased to  million in from million in as a percentage of revenues  income before income taxes increased percentage points  to  from in factors contributing to that improvement were a percentage point increase in homebuilding gross margins  a percentage point improvement in homebuilding sg a expenses as a percentage of revenues and improved operating margins in our financial services segment 
the consolidated provision for income taxes increased to million in  from million in  due to the corresponding increase in income before income taxes 
the effective income tax rate for fiscal year was  percentage points higher than the rate of fiscal  due primarily to increases in pre tax income in states with higher tax rates 
year ended september  compared to year ended september  consolidated revenues increased to  million in from  million in  primarily due to increases in both home sales and financial services revenues 
the increase in home sales revenues was attributable in part to  million in revenues generated by fortress florida  acquired in may  emerald builders  acquired in july  and schuler homes  inc  acquired in february  during the periods in that were less than one year after each was acquired 
income before income taxes increased to million in from million in as a percentage of revenues  income before income taxes increased percentage points  to  from in factors contributing to that improvement were reductions in homebuilding other expense  a percentage point improvement in homebuilding sg a expenses as a percentage of revenues  a significantly improved operating margin in our financial services segment  all offset in part by a percentage point decline in our homebuilding gross margins 
the decline in the homebuilding gross margin was due primarily to sales of inventory acquired in the schuler acquisition that had lower gross margins as a result of purchase accounting adjustments that increased the acquired inventory to its fair value as of the date of the acquisition 
if the acquired inventory had been recorded at schuler s historical cost  rather than adjusted to its fair value at acquisition and to conform to our inventory accounting policies  reported homebuilding gross profit would have been greater by approximately million of homebuilding revenues 

table of contents the consolidated provision for income taxes increased to million in  from million in  due to the corresponding increase in income before income taxes 
the effective income tax rate of remained the same in both periods

 consolidation of variable interest entities 
the consolidation of these entities added million in land inventory not owned to the company s balance sheet as of september  the inventory increase was financed largely by retaining earnings and by issuing senior notes

the facility matures in january  and is guaranteed by substantially all of our wholly owned subsidiaries other than those that make up our financial services segment 
at september   we had outstanding homebuilding debt of  million 
under the debt covenants associated with the revolving credit facility  our additional homebuilding borrowing capacity under it is limited to the lesser of the unused portion of the facility  million at september   or an amount determined under a borrowing base arrangement 
under the borrowing base limitation  the sum of our senior debt and the amount drawn on our revolving credit facility may not exceed certain percentages of the various categories of our inventory 
at september   the borrowing base arrangement would have limited our additional borrowing capacity from any source to  million 
at september   we were in compliance with all of the covenants  limitations and restrictions that form a part of our public debt obligations and our bank revolving credit facility 
we have entered into multi year interest rate swap agreements  aggregating a notional amount of million  that have the effect of fixing the interest rate on a portion of the variable rate revolving credit facility at 
on december   we issued million of senior notes due the net proceeds from this offering were used to repay borrowings under the unsecured revolving credit facility 
these notes are guaranteed by substantially all of our wholly owned subsidiaries other than our financial services subsidiaries 
on april   we issued million of senior notes due the majority of the net proceeds from this offering was used to redeem the approximately million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our senior notes due  which we called for full redemption on april  and redeemed on may   at a redemption price of of the principal amount  together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date 
the aggregate redemption price  including accrued interest  amounted to million 
concurrent with the redemption  we recorded interest expense of approximately million  representing unamortized discount and unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the redeemed notes 
the senior notes due are guaranteed by substantially all of our wholly owned subsidiaries other than our financial services subsidiaries 
on may   we called our zero coupon convertible senior notes due for redemption 
the aggregate accreted value of the notes on the date of the call was million 
the call for redemption gave the note holders the right to convert their notes into shares of our common stock or to redeem them for their cash accreted value on the redemption date 
all of the notes were presented to us by june   for 
table of contents conversion into dr horton common stock  and accordingly we issued approximately million shares in exchange for the notes 
on june   we issued million of senior notes due the net proceeds from this offering were used to redeem the million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our senior notes due  which we called for full redemption on june  and redeemed on july   at a redemption price of of the principal amount  together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption date

during fiscal  we repurchased  shares of our common stock in open market transactions at an aggregate purchase price of million 
on july   our board of directors increased the authorizations for repurchases of our common stock and of our outstanding debt securities to million each 
at september   million remained of the stock repurchase authorization and million remained of the debt securities repurchase authorization 
we examine the carrying value of our excess cost over net assets acquired goodwill annually to determine whether there are any impairment losses 
impairment is determined to exist when the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value 
our consolidated goodwill amounted to million homebuilding and million financial services at september  we performed the required tests during the last two fiscal years and determined that no goodwill or other intangible asset impairments existed 
at september   our financial services segment had mortgage loans held for sale of million and loan commitments for million at fixed rates 
we hedge the interest rate risk on these mortgage loans and mortgage loan commitments through the use of best efforts whole loan delivery commitments  forward sales of mortgage backed securities and the infrequent purchase of options on financial instruments 
changes in the value of the derivative instruments are recognized in current earnings  as are the changes in the value of the funded loans 
such gains and losses have not significantly affected our financial services results of operations 
currently  our wholly owned mortgage company has a mortgage warehouse loan facility in the amount of million which matures on february   and which is secured by certain mortgage loans held for sale 
the mortgage warehouse facility is not guaranteed by either the parent company or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee our homebuilding debt  and is expected to be renewed prior to maturity in the ordinary course of business 
at september   million had been drawn under the mortgage warehouse facility 
our wholly owned mortgage company completed a million mortgage backed commercial paper conduit facility the cp conduit facility in july the cp conduit facility was increased to million on july  although the current agreement governing the cp conduit facility expires on june   maintenance of the facility beyond the first and subsequent anniversary date s must be annually approved by the sponsoring bank 
the cp conduit facility is also secured by certain mortgage loans held for sale and is not guaranteed by either the parent company or any of the subsidiaries that guarantee our homebuilding debt 
as of september   million had been drawn under the cp conduit facility 
the mortgage loans pledged to secure the cp conduit facility are used as collateral for mortgage backed securities sold in the secondary commercial paper markets at rates that are more attractive than those applicable to the mortgage warehouse facility 
all mortgage company activities are financed with the mortgage warehouse facility  the cp conduit facility or internally generated funds 
both of the financial services credit facilities contain financial covenants with which we are in compliance 
our historical strategy of internal growth and growth by acquisitions has required significant amounts of cash 
if we are to achieve our future growth targets  we expect that those cash requirements will continue 
we anticipate that future home construction  lot and land purchases and any acquisitions will be funded through internally generated funds  existing and future credit facilities and the issuance of new debt or equity securities 
at september   under currently effective shelf registration statements  we had approxi 
table of contents mately million shares of common stock issuable to effect  in whole or in part  possible future acquisitions and the capacity to issue new debt or equity securities amounting to million 
in the future  we intend to continue to maintain effective shelf registration statements that will facilitate access to the capital markets 
we believe that our current cash position  our cash generation capabilities  the amounts available under our revolving line of credit agreements and our ability to access the capital markets in a timely manner with our existing shelf registration statements are adequate to meet our cash needs for the foreseeable future 
during fiscal  our board of directors declared one quarterly cash dividend of per common share and three quarterly cash dividends of per common share  the last of which was paid on august  to stockholders of record on august  on october  our board of directors declared a cash dividend of per common share which was paid on october  to stockholders of record on october  on december   our board of directors declared a three for two common stock split to be effected as a stock dividend which will be payable on january  to holders of record on december  cash will be paid in lieu of fractional shares 
except for ordinary expenditures for the construction of homes  the acquisition of land and lots for development and sale of homes  at september   we had no material commitments for capital expenditures 
off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business  we enter into land and lot option purchase contracts in order to procure land or lots for the construction of homes 
lot option contracts enable us to control significant lot positions with a minimal capital investment and substantially reduces the risks associated with land ownership and development 
at september   we had million in deposits to purchase land and lots with a total purchase price of billion 
only million of the billion in land and lot option purchase contracts contain specific performance clauses which require us to purchase the land or lots 
pursuant to fin  we consolidated certain variable interest entities with assets of million 
at september   we had outstanding letters of credit of million and performance bonds of  million  issued by third parties  to secure performance under various contracts 
we expect that the obligations secured by these letters of credit and performance bonds will generally be performed in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with the applicable contractual terms 
to the extent that the obligations are performed  the related letters of credit and performance bonds will be released and we will not have any continuing obligations 
we have no material third party guarantees 
inflation we and the homebuilding industry in general may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation  primarily because of higher land and construction costs 
inflation also increases our financing  labor and material costs 
in addition  higher mortgage interest rates significantly affect the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective homebuyers 
we attempt to pass through to our customers any increases in our costs through increased sales prices and  to date  inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
however  there is no assurance that inflation will not have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations 
safe harbor statement certain statements contained in this report  as well as in other materials we have filed or will file with the securities and exchange commission  statements made by us in periodic press releases and oral statements we make to analysts  stockholders and the press in the course of presentations about us  may be construed as forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements typically include the words anticipate  believe  expect  estimate  pro 
table of contents ject and future 
any or all of the forward looking statements included in this report and in any other of our reports or public statements may turn out to be inaccurate due to known or unknown risks and uncertainties 
as a result  actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in and anticipated by the forward looking statements 
the following cautionary discussion of risks and uncertainties relevant to our business includes factors we believe could adversely affect us 
other factors beyond those listed below could also adversely affect us 
general economic  real estate and other conditions the homebuilding industry is cyclical and is significantly affected by changes in general and local economic conditions  such as employment levels  availability of financing for home buyers  interest rates  consumer confidence and housing demand 
any oversupply of alternatives to new homes  such as rental properties and used homes  could depress new home prices and reduce our margins on the sale of new homes 
homebuilders are also subject to risks related to the availability and cost of land suitable for homebuilding  the availability and cost of materials and labor and adverse weather conditions which can cause delays in construction schedules and cost overruns 
increases in interest rates or decreases in mortgage availability virtually all of our customers finance their homes through lenders providing mortgage financing 
any future increases in interest rates or decreases in the availability of mortgage financing could depress the market for new homes by making our homes less affordable 
governmental regulations and environmental matters we are subject to extensive and complex regulations that affect the development and homebuilding process  including zoning  density and building standards 
such regulations often provide broad discretion to the administering governmental authorities 
this can delay or increase the costs of development or homebuilding 
laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment can cause delays  increased costs of compliance and prohibitions or restrictions of development and homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive areas 
substantial debt we have a significant amount of debt 
the amount of our debt could limit our ability to obtain future financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  debt service requirements or other requirements 
it could also limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and make us more vulnerable in the event of a downturn in our business or in general economic conditions 
competitive conditions the homebuilding industry is very competitive 
in each of the markets we serve  we compete with other homebuilders for home buyers  desirable properties  financing  raw materials and skilled labor 
competitive conditions in the homebuilding industry could result in difficulty in acquiring suitable land at acceptable prices  the need for increased selling incentives  lower sales or delays in construction 
availability of capital our ability to grow our business and operations profitably is substantially dependent upon our ability to generate or obtain capital 
important sources of capital have included the sale of equity or debt and additional bank borrowings 
increases in interest rates  changes in our debt ratings by the national credit rating agencies  concerns by potential investors about the market or the economy  changing lending objectives of financial institutions  or further consolidation of financial institutions that lend to the homebuilding industry could increase our costs of borrowing or reduce the availability of funds necessary for us to achieve our strategic growth objectives 
moreover  the indentures for our outstanding debt contain provisions that may restrict the debt we may incur in the future 
growth strategies since  we have acquired many homebuilding companies 
although we are currently focusing on internal growth  we may make strategic acquisitions of homebuilding companies in the future 
successful strategic acquisitions require the integration of operations and management and other efforts to realize the benefits that may be available 
although we believe that we have been successful in doing so in the past  we can give no assurance that  when we resume our acquisition 
table of contents activity  we will be able to successfully identify  acquire and integrate strategic acquisitions in the future 
moreover  we may not be able to implement successfully our operating and growth strategies within our existing markets 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
however  any further disclosures made on related subjects in subsequent reports on forms k  q and k should be consulted 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to interest rate risk on our long term debt 
we monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates and utilize both fixed and variable rate debt 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates generally affect the value of the debt instrument  but not our earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for variable rate debt  changes in interest rates generally do not impact the fair value of the debt instrument  but may affect our future earnings and cash flows 
we have mitigated our exposure to changes in interest rates on our variable rate bank debt by entering into interest rate swap agreements to obtain a fixed interest rate for a portion of the variable rate borrowings 
we generally do not have an obligation to prepay fixed rate debt prior to maturity and  as a result  interest rate risk and changes in fair value would not have a significant impact on our fixed rate debt until such time as we are required to refinance  repurchase or repay such debt 
our interest rate swaps were not designated as hedges under sfas no 
when it was adopted on october  we are exposed to market risk associated with changes in the fair values of the swaps  and such changes must be reflected in our income statements 
our mortgage company is exposed to interest rate risk associated with its mortgage loan origination services 
interest rate lock commitments irlc s are extended to borrowers who have applied for loan funding and who meet certain defined credit and underwriting criteria 
typically  the irlc s will have a duration of less than six months 
some irlc s are committed immediately to a specific investor through the use of best efforts whole loan delivery commitments  while the majority of irlc s are funded prior to being committed to third party investors 
forward sales of mortgage backed securities fmbs are used to protect uncommitted irlc s against the risk of changes in interest rates 
fmbs related to irlc s are classified and accounted for as non designated derivative instruments  with gains and losses recorded in current earnings 
fmbs related to funded  uncommitted loans are designated as fair value hedges  with changes in the value of the derivative instruments recognized in current earnings  along with changes in the value of the funded  uncommitted loans 
the effectiveness of the fair value hedges is continuously monitored and any ineffectiveness  which for the years ended september   and was not significant  is recognized in current earnings 
at september   total fmbs to mitigate interest rate risk related to uncommitted mortgage loans held for sale and uncommitted irlc s totaled approximately million  the duration of which was less than six months 
at september   the fair value of the fmbs and irlc s was approximately the following table sets forth  as of september   for our debt obligations  principal cash flows by scheduled maturity  weighted average interest rates and estimated fair market value
