item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview novoste commenced operations as a medical device company in may since  we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to developing the beta cath system 
the company commenced the active marketing of the beta cath system in europe in january for use in patients suffering from in stent restenosis  a condition in which coronary stents become clogged with new tissue growth 
on november   novoste received us marketing approval for the millimeter beta cath system from the fda and subsequently shipped its first commercial system on november  the number of commercial sites in the us increased to over in since our inception through june  we experienced significant losses in each period due to product development and clinical trial costs and  beginning in  the costs of launching the beta cath system in the us at december  we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
the company experienced its first net operating profit in the third quarter of we expect to achieve an operating profit in as we continue to allocate resources to leverage our existing manufacturing operations  both internally and with outside vendors  we also expect our sales and marketing efforts in support of united states market development to level off as a percent of net sales and anticipate that our administrative activities to support our growth will remain at a constant level 
at the same time we will continue to conduct clinical trials and research and development projects in order to expand the opportunities for our technology 
the company also faces intense competition in the field of vascular brachytherapy with companies that have significantly greater resources than novoste including johnson johnson and guidant 
both johnson johnson and guidant have introduced vascular brachytherapy products that compete with our beta cath system 
a new technology called drug coated stents poses additional competitive threats in treating restenosis 
we may not be able to sustain an acceptable level of market demand for the beta cath system if this technology is successfully introduced 
failing to sustain our current level of demand could significantly reduce revenues and affect our ability to remain profitable 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires that we adopt and follow certain accounting policies 
certain amounts presented in the financial statements have been determined based upon estimates and assumptions 
although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  actual results may differ and could be material 
we have included below a discussion of the critical accounting policies that we believe are affected by our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements  how we apply such policies  and how results differing from our estimates and assumptions would affect the amounts presented in our financial statements 
other accounting policies also have a significant effect on our financial statements  and some of these policies also require the use of estimates and assumptions 
note to the consolidated financial statements discusses our significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition revenue from the sale of products is recorded when an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and services have been rendered  the seller s price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
the company earns revenue from sales of catheters and from license and lease agreements to use the radiation source trains and transfer devices included in the beta cath system 

table of contents novoste uses distributors in countries where the distributors experience and knowledge of local radiation and medical device regulatory issues is considered beneficial by the company s management 
under the distributor arrangements  there are generally no purchase commitments and no provisions for cancellation of purchases 
novoste or the distributor may cancel the distributor agreements at any time 
revenue from sales of catheters directly to hospitals is recognized upon shipment after the hospital has leased a beta cath system and completed all licensing and other requirements to use the system 
the company recognizes revenue from sales of catheters to distributors at the time of shipment 
the company retains ownership of the radiation source trains and transfer devices and enters into either a lease or license agreement with its customers 
revenue recognition begins once an agreement has been executed  the system has been shipped  and all licensing and other requirements to use the system have been completed 
the revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
the terms of the operating lease signed with customers located in the united states requires  as dictated by fda regulatory approval  replacement and servicing of the radiation source train and transfer device at six month intervals or number of usages 
this amount is included in cost of sales as incurred 
no other post sale obligations exist 
the company sells its catheters with no right of return except in cases of product malfunction or shipping errors 
in connection with the approval to relaunch the f catheter system on january  the company plans to exchange some f catheters for f catheters for its customers 
a reserve has been recorded against revenue for known returns and an estimate of unknown returns 
the exchange of these catheters is expected to continue in the future until the f system had been fully launched to a significant majority of customer sites 
at december   the company had recorded a reserve for approximately  to recognize the f catheters purchased prior to december  that were expected to be returned in the future in exchange for f catheters 
radiation and transfer devices and amortization of costs the company retains ownership of the radiation source trains rsts and transfer devices tds that are manufactured by third party vendors 
the costs to acquire  test and assemble these assets are recorded as incurred 
the company has determined that based upon experience  testing and discussions with the fda the estimated useful life of rsts and tds exceeds one year and is potentially as long as four years 
accordingly  the company classifies these assets as long term assets 
depreciation of the costs of these assets is included in cost of sales and is recognized over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method 
depreciation begins at the time the beta cath tm system is placed into service 
valuation reserves are recorded for the balance of unamortized costs of tds and rsts that are not available for use by a customer due to expiration or unsatisfactory performance measures 
the company has invested significant resources to acquire rsts and tds that make up the beta cath tm system and offers multiple treatment length catheters each of which requires a different td and rst 
the acquisition of these various length systems are based upon demand forecasts derived from available information provided by the company s sales and marketing organizations 
if actual demand were less favorable  or of a different mixture of treatment lengths than those projected by management  additional valuation allowances might be required which would negatively impact operating profits 
during the second quarter of  novoste decided to concentrate marketing and development efforts on the f diameter beta cath tm system 
accordingly  the company evaluated the recoverability of the carrying value for f devices and other assets to determine if an impairment charge was necessary 
the company performed this evaluation in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

based on this evaluation  the company determined that an impairment and other related charges of million was warranted see note 
management will continue to evaluate its long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 

table of contents stock based compensation the company uses the intrinsic value method for valuing its awards of stock options and restricted stock and recording the related compensation expense  if any  in accordance with apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
the company grants stock options generally for a fixed number of shares to employees  directors  consultants and independent contractors with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the shares at the date of grant 
compensation expense is recognized for increases in the estimated fair value of common stock for any stock options with variable terms 
no compensation expense is recognized for stock option grants to employees for which the terms are fixed and the exercise price is equal to the fair value of the shares at the date of the grant 
the company accounts for equity instruments issued to non employees in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
any compensation expense related to grants that do not vest immediately is amortized over the vesting period of the stock options using the straight line method as that methodology most closely approximates the way in which the option holder earns those options 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for the estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
most of our customers are hospitals located in the us  however  some are distributors of our products in foreign countries or hospitals located in europe 
the amount recorded in the allowances is based primarily on management s evaluation of the financial condition of the customers 
if the financial condition of any customers deteriorates  additional allowances may be required 
allowances are also maintained for future sales returns and allowances based on an analysis of recent trends of product returns 
actual losses from uncollectible accounts are charged against the allowance when it is determined that the account cannot be collected 
ending balances for the allowance for doubtful accounts were  and  for the years ending december  and  respectively 
bad debt expenses were  in and  in actual write offs of balances due were  in and  in a portion   of the increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts in was due to increases in the exchange rate of accounts denominated in euros during inventories novoste values its inventories at the lower of cost or market value on a first in  first out fifo basis 
provisions are recorded for excess or obsolete inventory equal to the cost of the inventory 
shelf life expiration or replacement products in the marketplace may cause product obsolescence 
if actual product demand and market conditions were less favorable than those projected by management  additional provisions might be required which would negatively impact operating profits 
novoste evaluates the adequacy of these provisions quarterly 
inventory reserves were  at december  and  at december  the increase was due primarily to revenues against f catheters following the voluntary recall in august results of operations comparison of years ended december  and the net loss for the year ended december  was  or 
per share  as compared to  or loss per share  for the year earlier 
net sales and revenues 
net sales and revenues were  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease was due to the voluntary recall of the f catheters in august revenues recorded in the united states for the year ended december  were  as compared to  for the year ended december  comparatively  
table of contents international revenue decreased to  in compared to  in factors impacting both us and international revenue included the voluntary recall of the f catheters in august as well as increased competition in the us 
cost of sales 
cost of sales for the year ended december  were  resulting in a gross margin of  or as compared to cost of sales of  and a gross margin of  or of net sales for the year ended december  the decrease in gross margin on both an absolute and percentage basis is impacted partially due to the introduction of the f system during the second quarter of and the additional amortization and service costs associated with having a second beta cath system in the market 
however  the margins were also impacted by the impairment and other related charges of  taken in the second quarter of against the carrying value of f assets 
cost of sales includes raw material  labor and overhead to manufacture catheters as well as the amortized costs of transfer devices and radiation source trains including device servicing and repair costs  and radiation shipping and disposal costs used in the beta cath system 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to  for the twelve months ended december  from  for the twelve months ended december  this increase was primarily the result of the launch of both the mobile and bravo clinical trials 
novaste anticipates increasing research and development expenses in as it pursues substantial completion of these two trials 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the previous year 
the decrease represents lower costs to distribute the catheter products considering that a significant portion of customer sites were added during and included costs for maintaining those accounts and launching and subsequently recalling the f beta cath system 
sales and marketing expenses were also reduced based upon consolidation of european facilities begun in and certain workforce reductions in the us general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the decrease for this period was primarily the result of lower management expenses accounting  information systems  human resources and benefits due to the reduction in revenue growth of the beta cath system 
in addition  salaries and expenses for the office of ceo were less in prior to the transition to our new ceo  in october other income 
net other income decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the prior year 
the decrease in other income is primarily attributable to the decrease in interest income year to date as a result of a decrease in short term investment balances combined with falling interest rates 
comparison of years ended december  and the net loss for the year ended december  was  or 
per share  as compared to  or loss per share  for the year earlier 
the decrease in net loss for the twelve months ended december  was primarily due to an increase in revenue from sales in the us market from its commercial launch of the beta cath system 
net sales and revenues 
net sales and revenues were  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  the increase was due to the fda approval of the beta cath system in november and the initial  first full year of sales in the us revenues recorded in the united states for the year ended december  were  as compared to  for the year ended december  the increase in revenues was primarily due to the addition of over sites in 
table of contents the us market and the accompanying stocking orders for catheters in these new sites 
typically a new site in the us will order to catheters 
comparatively  international revenue increased to  compared to  international sales increased from the prior year due to adding sites in other parts of the world 
non us revenue has not risen at the same rate seen in the united states because of a lack of acceptance of vascular brachytherapy in europe and no insurance reimbursement approval 
the us market received insurance reimbursement for the procedure in the second half of that contributed to the acceptance and growth in revenue in this market 
cost of sales 
cost of sales for the year ended december  were  resulting in a gross margin of  or as compared to cost of sales of  and a gross margin of  or of net sales for the year ended december  the increase in gross margin on both an absolute and percentage basis is due to the higher sales and production volumes and improved production yields during cost of sales includes raw material  labor and overhead to manufacture catheters as well as the amortized costs of transfer devices and radiation source trains including device servicing and repair costs  and radiation shipping and disposal costs used in the beta cath system 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  these decreases were primarily the result of decreased clinical trial activity related to the completion of patient enrollment in the pivotal trials  the largest expense of which was the costs of supplying product to clinical sites 
research and development expenses were favorably impacted by the approval of the beta cath system in november sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased to  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the previous year 
these increases were primarily the result of higher personnel  trade show  consulting and promotional literature costs associated with marketing our product on a direct basis in the us and europe and significant expenses in recruiting  training and retaining a united states sales force for the launch of the beta cath system in the united states 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increase for this period was primarily the result of additional management personnel at higher salaries and the increase in infrastructure accounting  information systems  human resources and benefits to support the commercial launch of the beta cath system 
restructuring and other expenses 
restructuring charges of  were recorded in primarily related to a reduction in workforce of thirteen employees located in europe and six employees located in the unites states in addition to termination of certain facility leases in europe 
we paid  of the restructuring charges in related to severance payments and lease payments for closed facilities and had  remaining in accrued expenses at december  related primarily to severance agreements and facility lease and termination payments 
other income 
net other income decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the prior year 
the decrease in interest income was primarily due to the decrease in average cash equivalent and short term investment balances that were used for operations combined with falling interest rates 
liquidity and capital resources during the year ended december   novoste generated cash from operations of million 
the components of cash generated or used and reasons for change from over are as follows i  provided from accounts receivable as collections outrun revenues due to the slower revenue run rate in the last half of  compared to the last half of and the recall of the f product beginning in august which generated catheter exchanges at no charge  ii  used for inventory increases  but less than due to 
table of contents slower inventory growth also due to the slower revenue run rate offset by the introduction of more catheter offerings by the company necessitating greater inventory requirements per revenue dollar  iii  provided by a decrease in prepaid expenses as several clinical trials reached conclusion  iv  provided by a decrease in other assets offset by an increase in amortization of radiation and transfer devices and a  impairment charge  v  used by operating losses  vi  used by reducing accounts payables because purchases at the end of were significantly lower than the end of when the company was getting ready to launch the f diameter catheter  vii  used by fewer accrued expenses and taxes withheld because of slower growth  and viii  used by a decrease in unearned revenue related to revenue recognized on radiation and transfer devices due to much lower revenues on second year leases of transfer devices 
the improvement in cash from operations during resulted from fewer resources were required in to fund the opening of customer sites  expansion of the launch of the beta cath system and the related transfer devices  radiation source trains and catheter inventory required during when novoste opened over sites 
activities related to the launch of the f beta cath system and the subsequent voluntary recall of the f catheters were the primary uses of cash in net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december   was million 
million in cash was provided by shorter maturities of available for sale securities   was used for purchase of property and equipment  but at a lower level than due to completion of manufacturing facilities  and  was used for the purchase of additional radiation and transfer devices  but at a lower level than as the rate of adding new customer sites slowed
