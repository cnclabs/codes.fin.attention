the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview since june  we have been a designer  developer and manufacturer of storage solutions 
in june  we entered the telecommunication solutions business with our acquisition of stonehouse 
accordingly  we believe that the comparison between and may not be meaningful in certain respects 
in addition  due to the fact that stonehouse s operating results were not included in our consolidated financial statements until june  we expect that many of the components of our future operating results will increase in going concern with respect to our consolidated financial statements  for the years ended december   and  we have received a going concern opinion from our auditors 
as more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  our recurring operating losses and our continued experience of negative cash flows from operating activities raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
a going concern opinion indicates that although there is substantial doubt  the financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis and do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty 
comparison of years ended december  and for the year ended december   we reported a net loss of million as compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  sales sales for were million as compared to million in  a decrease of million 
included in sales for was million attributable to our telecommunication solutions business following our june acquisition of stonehouse 
the decline in our storage solutions sales reflects the economic downturn that has caused customer delays in acquiring technology and other capital equipment  in addition to the transition from our older technology legacy products to our new product family centered around our nexstor series 
during  indirect sales to oems and other channel business represented of our storage solutions revenue  compared to for direct sales to end users 
indirect  direct and service revenues represented  and  respectively  of our revenues 
the increased proportion of indirect sales in reflects a strategy shift to provide a greater technological marketing and sales support to our indirect sales function 
service revenues were insignificant in as result of our august sale of substantially all our service business see note to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of segment information and sales to significant customers 
cost of sales gross margins gross margins realized by our storage solutions business in improved to compared to reported for during the second half of  we realized gross margins of  representing a significant improvement over the first half of when we realized gross margins 
this improvement reflects significantly lower material costs attributable to the commencement during the third quarter of i outsourcing the manufacturing of our products and ii shipments of our new series storage systems 
positive gross margins were not achieved during the first half of primarily due to i economies of scale attributable to the level of fixed costs inherent in our operations  coupled with significantly lower revenues  and ii the price we paid for certain materials in connection with our series storage systems prior to the commencement of our manufacturing outsource agreement for our new series 
as a result of outsourcing our production  we phased out our manufacturing facility in san diego  california during the third quarter of a contributing factor to the low gross margins for was a fourth quarter million increase in inventory reserves due to obsolete inventory 
our telecommunication solutions business experienced a gross margin for the seven months ended december  combined gross margins for our storage solutions and telecommunication solutions for amounted to see note to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of segment information and significant customers 
we expect an overall improvement in our gross margins in primarily as a result of a full year of gross margins attributable to our telecommunication solutions business  in addition to anticipated improved gross margins attributable to our series storage solutions 
our gross margins are dependent  in part  on product mix  which fluctuates from time to time 
our material costs are subject to fluctuations experienced during business cycles that create shortages and excess supplies of some critical components  thereby creating increases and decreases in costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a decreased to million in from million in the million decrease principally resulted from the reduction of our overall work force and related costs including occupancy expenses  partially offset by million in sg a incurred by our telecommunication solutions business 
we expect sg a to increase in as we incur a full twelve months of sg a attributable to our telecommunication solutions business 
research and development r d total r d expenses decreased to million in from million in we incurred  in r d expenses attributable to our telecommunication solutions business following our acquisition  which was more than offset by an  decrease in r d associated with our storage solutions business 
this decrease was primarily the result of an overall decrease in r d expenses following the development of our series of storage systems 
we believe that considerable future investments in r d will be required to remain competitive in both our businesses 
r d costs associated with moniesweb r software production in were expensed as incurred until technological feasibility was established 
thereafter  moniesweb r software production costs were capitalized until the product was available for general release to customers in early capitalized software costs will be amortized beginning in based on the greater of i the estimated economic life on the straight line method  or ii the ratio that current revenues attributable to moniesweb r revenues bears to total current and estimated future revenues for moniesweb r 
other r d costs were expensed as incurred 
r d costs may fluctuate considerably from time to time depending on a variety of factors 
these costs are incurred substantially in advance of related revenues  and in certain situations  may not result in generating revenues 
as of december   we capitalized  in software development costs associated with the development of moniesweb r 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization decreased to million in from million in the  decrease reflects the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and intangible assets  which resulted in the discontinuation of amortization of goodwill with a carrying value of approximately million effective january   partially offset by  in amortization of other intangible assets of million resulting from the stonehouse acquisition see note to consolidated financial statements 
amortization of goodwill for amounted to  realized and unrealized losses on marketable securities  net for and  we recorded net losses on marketable securities of million and  respectively 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion 
other income  net other income  net amounted to million in both and see note to consolidated financial statements for a detailed break down of the components of other income  net 
fair value of option granted to customer during  we recorded a  non cash charge for the fair value of an option granted to a customer 
see note to consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion 
interest expense interest expense amounted to  in as compared to  in the decrease is primarily attributable to significantly lower average borrowings and lower interest rates 
income taxes we have recorded a valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets  which  more likely than not  will not be realized  based on recent operating results 
comparison of years ended december  and for the year ended december   we reported a net loss of million as compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  results of operations for include a net gain of million from the sale of assets of a subsidiary and a charge of million for impairment of unamortized goodwill 
sales sales for were million as compared to million in  a decrease of million 
the significant decrease reflects the transition from our older technology legacy products to our technology products centered around our nexstor u storage enclosures and raid systems as well as the economic downturn causing customer delays in acquiring technology and other capital equipment 
during  we began to expand our indirect channel business and shift our sales and marketing strategy to provide greater technical marketing and sales support to our indirect sales function 
as part of that strategy  beginning in january  we significantly reduced our direct sales personnel and related costs  and refocused our direct sales force to targeted markets and existing customers 
during  direct  indirect and service revenues represented  and  respectively  of our sales revenues  compared to  and  respectively  in in august  we sold substantially all of our service business 
the higher service revenues in relate to the recognition as revenue of the remaining unamortized deferred revenues following the sale of our service business 
cost of sales gross margins gross margins decreased from in to in gross margins in both periods were adversely affected by i the level of fixed costs inherent in our operations as compared with significantly lower than expected sales levels  and ii increases in inventory reserves due to obsolete inventory of million and million in and  respectively 
our gross margins are dependent  in part  on product mix  which fluctuates from time to time 
our material costs are subject to fluctuations experienced during business cycles that create shortages and excess supplies of some critical components  thereby creating increases and decreases in costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a decreased to million in from million in the million decrease is primarily the result of our overall work force reduction previously discussed under sales 
research and development r d expenses amounted to million in  as compared to million in amounts in both years reflect the costs incurred to develop our nexstor and u product lines 
r d costs were expensed as incurred  substantially in advance of related revenues  and in certain situations  did not result in generating revenues 
depreciation and amortization impairment of goodwill depreciation and amortization decreased to million in from million in the decrease was due to reduced amortization resulting from the fourth quarter write down of million of goodwill which was determined to have been impaired because of our projected inability to generate sufficient future operating income from the assets acquired in a acquisition 
amortization of goodwill for the year ended december  amounted to realized and unrealized losses on marketable securities  net during  we recognized  in net losses on marketable securities composed of an  realized gain and an  unrealized loss 
see note to consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion 
other income  net other income  net amounted to million in see note to consolidated financial statements for a detailed breakdown of the components of other income  net 
other income was not significant in interest expense interest expense decreased  to  in the decrease was primarily attributable to decreased lower average borrowings and lower interest rates 
income taxes we have recorded a valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets  which  more likely than not  will not be realized based on recent operating results 
net loss available to common stock preferred stock dividends during and  with the exception of our series k preferred stock  all classes of our convertible preferred stock required dividends at per annum 
preferred stock dividends increased by  to million during principally due to the issuance of million and million of preferred stock in december and april  respectively  partially offset by the automatic conversion of million and million of preferred stock to common stock in july and october  respectively 
in connection with the halco investment see note to consolidated financial statements  which closed in november  all of our remaining convertible preferred stock and accrued dividends thereon were converted to common stock 
induced conversion of convertible preferred stock in november  as a result of inducement shares issued in connection with the conversion of our convertible preferred stock as a condition to the halco investment see note to consolidated financial statements  we recorded a million non cash charge to arrive at net loss available to common stock  representing the fair value of the inducement shares issued 
the fair value was based on 
per share  the price paid by halco for its purchase of million shares of our common stock 
liquidity and capital resources the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern 
this contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
as shown in the consolidated financial statements  we have experienced negative cash flows from operating activities  decreased sales revenues and recurring net losses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in addition  we have negative working capital of million as of december  these matters  among others  raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
however  since we have devoted substantial efforts to i streamline our operations  ii establish the foundation for generating positive cash flow and operating profits  and iii obtain sufficient financing to cover our working capital needs 
these efforts include a significant reduction in our direct sales personnel and related costs as part of our strategy to provide greater technical  marketing and sales support to expand the our indirect customer channel base 
additional personnel reductions have been implemented to reflect our lower sales levels  our recent manufacturing outsourcing agreement described below and to provide certain cost efficiencies 
further efforts to reduce our fixed operating costs resulted in the relocation of our executive and business headquarters to a more economical facility in carlsbad  california in december in july  we entered into a contract with varian for outsourcing the production of our s series of storage enclosures 
our f series is currently being assembled by an interim outside contractor 
as a result  we phased out our san diego  california manufacturing facility during the third quarter of the outsourcing agreement has resulted in a significant improvement in our operating margins by lowering manufacturing costs and overall operating costs 
since january   and through february   we obtained million of equity and debt financing from private investors 
of these amounts  million was received in from maurice halperin  our chairman of the board since august and a principal shareholder  or companies controlled by mr 
halperin collectively mr 
halperin  consisting of million in cash and million in marketable securities see note to consolidated financial statements 
equity and debt financing obtained from january through february  also included million from h 
irwin levy  our chief executive officer  vice chairman of the board and a principal shareholder  or companies controlled by mr 
levy collectively  mr

in addition  in connection with our outsourcing contract  mr 
levy provided collateral for a bank to issue a million letter of credit lc for the benefit of varian 
the lc was subsequently reduced to  we have agreed to indemnify mr 
levy for any amounts drawn upon the lc by varian 
in august  we entered into an agreement for purchase of accounts with a financial institution purchaser  providing for a  line of credit under which we may sell customer invoices to the purchaser 
the purchaser advances of the net face amount of qualified invoices and remits the remaining  less its fees  upon collecting the invoice in full 
we are obligated to repay the purchaser for invoices not paid within days 
in an effort to increase our cash flow and profitability  among other reasons  on june   we acquired of the outstanding capital stock of stonehouse 
the acquisition has had a positive impact on our gross margins and has contributed to our cash flow see note of consolidated financial statements 
we are currently exploring alternatives for raising additional debt or equity capital to finance our short term and long term plans as well as operating deficits expected to be incurred until we begin to generate positive operating cash flows 
however  due to conditions in the technology related financial markets and other uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control  there can be no assurances that such required additional funds will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all  or that we will be able to generate positive cash flows from operating activities in the future 
we currently have insufficient liquidity to fund our operating needs for the next twelve months 
the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result from our inability to continue as a going concern 
cash flow results operating activities net cash used in operating activities amounted to  and million for and  respectively 
the most significant use of cash for both years was our loss from operations before depreciation  amortization and other non cash items of million in and million in the most significant source of cash was the net reduction of accounts receivable and prepaid expenses of million in and million in in addition  in and  cash was provided by the net reduction in inventories of  and  respectively

american stock exchange amex on may   we received correspondence from amex regarding the potential delisting of our common stock from amex due to our failure to meet certain of amex s continued listing standards  related to minimum shareholders equity and our ability to continue operations and or meet our obligations as they mature 
on june   we submitted a plan and supporting documentation the plan to amex to demonstrate our ability to regain compliance 
on august   amex notified us that it had accepted our plan and granted us an extension through june  within which we must regain compliance  subject to periodic review by amex s staff 
failure to make progress consistent with the plan or to regain compliance with the continued listing standards by the end of the extension period could result in our stock being delisted 
we believe that we will be successful in regaining compliance  although there can be no assurance that we will remain listed on amex
