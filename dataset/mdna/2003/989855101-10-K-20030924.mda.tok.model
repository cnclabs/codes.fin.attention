item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation critical accounting policies  significant judgments  and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosures at the date of our consolidated financial statements 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  inventories  warranty obligations  income taxes  and long lived assets 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and current market conditions and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  warranty costs  accounting for incomes taxes  and valuation of long lived assets to be critical policies due to the estimates and judgments involved in each 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts we recognize revenue based on guidance provided in securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  there is no significant risk pertaining to customer acceptance  our price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on a continuous review of customer accounts  payment patterns  and specific collection issues 
we perform on going credit evaluations of our customers and do not require collateral from our customers 
for many of our international customers  we require an irrevocable letter of credit to be issued by the customer before a shipment is made 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on a first in  first out basis 
management evaluates the need to record adjustments for impairment of inventory on a monthly basis 
our policy is to assess the valuation of all inventories  including raw materials  work in process  and finished goods 
obsolete inventory or inventory in excess of management s estimated future usage is written down to its estimated market value  if less than its cost 
contracts with fixed prices are evaluated to determine if estimated total costs will exceed revenues 
a loss provision is recorded when the judgment is made that actual costs incurred plus estimated costs remaining to be incurred will exceed total revenues from the contract 
inherent in the estimates of market value are management s estimates related to current economic trends  future demand for our products  and technological obsolescence 
significant management judgments must be made when providing for obsolete and excess inventory and losses on contracts 
if actual market conditions are different than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs and loss accruals may be required 
warranty costs we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
we consider historical warranty costs actually incurred and specifically identified circumstances to establish the warranty liability 
the warranty liability is reviewed on a quarterly basis 
should actual costs differ from management s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
accounting for income taxes deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases  and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an estimated realizable amount based on historical and forecasted results 
while management has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event management were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should management determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
our effective tax rate may vary from period to period based on changes in estimated taxable income or loss  changes to the valuation allowance  changes to federal  state or foreign tax laws  and deductibility of certain costs and expenses by jurisdiction 
valuation of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the carrying value of intangible assets and other long lived assets is reviewed on a regular basis for the existence of facts or circumstances  both internally and externally  that may suggest impairment 
some factors we consider important  which could trigger the impairment review  include a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used  a significant adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset  an accumulation of costs for an asset in excess of the amount originally expected  a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection that demonstrates continuing losses  and a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset will be disposed of significantly before the end of its estimated useful life 
if such circumstances exist  we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets to determine if impairment exists based upon estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the assets and comparing that value to the carrying value of the assets 
if the carrying value of the assets is greater than the estimated future cash flows  the assets are written down to the estimated fair value 
we determine the estimated fair value of the assets based on a current market value of the assets 
if a current market value is not readily available  a projected discounted cash flow method is applied using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in the current business model 
our cash flow estimates contain management s best estimates  using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not created  and are not party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated into our financial statements 
we have not guaranteed any obligations of a third party 
results of operations as previously announced  we discontinued our telecommunications teraoptix business unit during fiscal we disposed of the unit s equipment and are currently marketing for sale the facility located in westborough  massachusetts 
accordingly  the results of teraoptix have been presented as a separate line item on the consolidated statements of operations as discontinued teraoptix operations  net of tax  for all periods presented 
in addition  the loss on disposal of the business  net of tax  including adjustments to original estimates  has been recorded as a separate line item for the fiscal periods presented 
the consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal and periods have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentations of the discontinued operations and loss on disposal of teraoptix 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales of million for fiscal increased by million  or  from the comparable prior year period sales of million 
net sales for fiscal included million from a development services agreement  as compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
the development services agreement is expected to be substantially completed by june revenue under this agreement can vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
for fiscal  net sales in the semiconductor segment were million  or of total net sales  as compared to million  or  in the prior year period and net sales in the industrial segment were million  or of total net sales  as compared to million  or  in the prior year period 
the increase in net sales in the semiconductor segment was primarily due to the sales from the development services agreement

approximately of all fiscal sales were in us dollars 
significant changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the value of the us dollar can impact the sales of our products in export markets  as would changes in the general economic conditions in those markets 
the impact of changes in foreign currency values on our sales cannot be measured 
gross profit for fiscal totaled million  an increase of million  or  from million in the prior fiscal year 
gross profit as a percentage of sales for fiscal and was and  respectively 
gross profit for fiscal included million from the development services agreement  as compared to million for fiscal selling  general  and administrative expenses sg a in fiscal amounted to million  a decrease of million  or  from fiscal sg a as a percentage of net sales in fiscal was  as compared to in fiscal the decrease in sg a for fiscal is primarily related to sg a costs eliminated after the sale of the automation systems group in december and a reduction in selling expenses  including commissions to outside sales representatives and personnel costs 
research and development expenses r d in fiscal totaled million  a decrease of million  or  from million in the comparable prior year period 
r d as a percentage of net sales in fiscal was  as compared to in fiscal the decrease was primarily related to the completion of several large research and development projects in the semiconductor segment in fiscal and the transfer of engineering resources to revenue producing projects in fiscal our operating profit in fiscal was million  as compared to an operating loss of million in fiscal operating profit as a percentage of sales in fiscal was  as compared to the operating loss as a percentage of sales of in fiscal the income tax expense from continuing operations in fiscal totaled million  or of pretax profits  which compares with an income tax benefit of million  or of pretax losses in fiscal the effective tax rate for fiscal relates primarily to large r d credits being applied to a low taxable income from continuing operations 
the overall tax rate  including the tax effect on the discontinued operations  for fiscal years and was 
we recorded a net loss of million for fiscal as compared to a net loss of million for fiscal on a diluted per share basis  the net loss was per share for fiscal as compared to a net loss of for fiscal the net loss for fiscal includes losses of million related to the operations of our discontinued teraoptix unit and charges of million related to the disposal of our discontinued teraoptix unit 
the net loss for fiscal includes losses related to the operations of our discontinued teraoptix unit of million 
the net loss for fiscal also includes a gain on the sale of our automation systems group of million before related exit costs of million  inventory write downs of million  and tax expense of million 
the income from continuing operations for fiscal was million  or per share  as compared to a net loss of million  or per share  for fiscal backlog at june  totaled million  a decrease of million  or  from million at june  the year end fiscal backlog consisted of million  or  in the semiconductor segment and million  or  in the industrial segment 
orders for fiscal totaled million 
orders related to the development services agreement totaled million in fiscal orders by segment for fiscal consisted of million  or  in the semiconductor segment and million  or  in the industrial segment 
fiscal compared to fiscal on december   we sold our automation systems group in longmont  colorado  to brooks automation  inc of chelmsford  massachusetts  in a cash transaction  for million 
substantially all of the assets were sold to brooks and substantially all of the liabilities were assumed by brooks 
the gain on the sale was million before related exit costs of million to be paid from the proceeds  inventory write downs of million  and tax expense of million 
net sales of million for fiscal decreased by million  or  from fiscal net sales of million 
for fiscal  net sales in the semiconductor segment were million  or of total net sales  as compared to million  or  in the prior year period and net sales in the industrial segment were million  or of total net sales  as compared to million  or  in the prior year period 
the decrease in sales is primarily due to a decrease in units sold  reflecting the downturn in the semiconductor industry 
sales to the americas  primarily the united states  amounted to million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or  from fiscal levels of million 
sales outside the americas amounted to million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or  from fiscal levels of million 
sales to japan during fiscal amounted to million  a decrease of million  or  from fiscal sales levels 
sales to europe other  primarily europe  amounted to million  an increase of million  or  from fiscal sales to the pacific rim  excluding japan  amounted to million  an increase of million  or  from fiscal sales levels 
substantially all of our sales and costs are negotiated and paid in us dollars 
significant changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the value of the us dollar can impact the sales of our products in our export markets  as would changes in the general economic conditions in those markets 
the impact of such changes in foreign currency values on our sales cannot be measured 
gross profit in fiscal amounted to million including million of inventory write downs related to the sale of the automation systems group in longmont  colorado to brooks automation  inc in december  a decrease of million  or  from gross profit of million in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of sales in fiscal was  as compared to in fiscal the decrease in gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of sales were primarily due to lower production volumes 
selling  general  and administrative expenses sg a in fiscal amounted to million  a decrease of million  or  from fiscal sg a as a percentage of net sales in fiscal was  as compared to in fiscal the decrease in sg a for fiscal resulted from lower incentive compensation costs due to lower sales volumes and net losses for fiscal research and development expenses r d in fiscal totaled million and increased by million  or  from fiscal r d as a percentage of net sales in fiscal was  as compared to in fiscal this increase was primarily due to the continued investment in the semiconductor segment  primarily in the motion measurement product line  through the first three quarters of fiscal our operating loss in fiscal was million including million of exit costs and million of inventory write downs related to the sale of the automation systems group in longmont  colorado  as compared to an operating profit of million in fiscal operating loss as a percentage of sales in fiscal was  as compared to the operating profit as a percentage of sales of in fiscal income tax benefit on continuing operations in fiscal totaled million  or of pretax losses  which compares with income tax expense on continuing operations of million  or of pretax profits  in fiscal the change in the effective tax rate is primarily due to changes in the valuation for certain state tax carryforwards and the effect of r d credits on a lower taxable loss amount 
we recorded a net loss for fiscal year of million  or loss per share  as compared to a net profit of million  or on a diluted per share basis  during fiscal the loss in fiscal includes a gain on the sale of the automation systems group in longmont  colorado of million  offset by related exit costs million  inventory write downs million  and tax expense million 
the basic and diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding for the fiscal year ended june  were  as compared to  basic shares and  fully diluted shares for the fiscal year ended june  the increase in the number of shares outstanding was primarily due to the  shares issued in march in the secondary offering of our common stock 
related party transactions sales to canon inc  a stockholder  and canon sales co  inc  a distributor of certain of our products in japan and a subsidiary of canon inc  amounted to million of net sales  million of net sales  and million of net sales  for the years ended june    and  respectively 
selling prices of products sold to canon inc and canon sales co  inc are based  generally  on the normal terms customarily given to distributors 
revenues generated from a development contract with canon are recorded on a cost plus basis 
at june  and  there was approximately  in the aggregate  million and million  respectively  of trade accounts receivable from canon 
in september  we entered into a contract with canon related to the development of certain interferometers 
the development contract currently has a value of million and generally covers the period through june  subject to meeting certain milestones during this period 
we have recognized revenue of million since the inception of this contract  including million of revenue in fiscal liquidity and capital resources at june   working capital was million  an increase of million from the million at june  we maintained cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities at june  totaling million 
this represents an increase of million from june  the increase was primarily due to a reduction in accounts receivable  a decrease in inventory  an improvement in operating results  and income tax refunds 
we disposed of the equipment and are currently marketing for sale the facility of the discontinued teraoptix unit located in westborough  massachusetts 
the remaining assets have been reclassified to current assets as assets of discontinued unit held for sale 
we intend to use the proceeds from the sale of the facility to pay down the mortgage loan and swap agreement described below 
the facility has been valued at an estimated fair market value based on third party appraisals 
the book value of the facility is estimated at million  which is net of estimated selling expenses 
as of june   the mortgage balance was million and the swap agreement liability was million 
if we are able to sell the facility for its book value  an additional million of cash on hand would be used to pay down the related debts 
factors which could influence the actual amount of cash used to pay the related debts include a selling price which differs from the current estimated value  the timing of the sale of the facility  and changes in the value of the swap agreement  which is based on financial market conditions 
the mortgage on the westborough facility  which has an interest rate of the one month libor rate plus an applicable margin based on a certain debt ratio approximately in total at june   is payable in full on may  the mortgage principal is amortizing on a year level amortization schedule requiring monthly principal and interest payments 
future mortgage principal payments by fiscal years ended june  to be paid until the mortgage is paid with the proceeds from the sale  if any  of the facility will total million for each fiscal year and million for the first months of fiscal with a final payment of million in may in conjunction with the mortgage  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that provides for a fixed interest rate of in place of the libor component for the duration of the mortgage 
the variable rate component based on our financial results can vary from to as of june  
there were no borrowings outstanding under our million bank line of credit at fiscal year end acquisitions of property  plant  and equipment were million for fiscal although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of various factors  management believes that cash generated from operations  together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and borrowing capability  will be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for the next months 
risk factors that may impact future results industry concentration and cyclicality our business is significantly dependent on capital expenditures and component requirements for manufacturers in the semiconductor industry 
this industry is cyclical and has historically experienced periods of oversupply  resulting in significantly reduced demand for capital equipment  including the products manufactured and marketed by us 
for the foreseeable future  our operations will continue to be dependent on the capital expenditures in this industry which  in turn  is largely dependent on the market demand in the semiconductor and industrial markets 
risks associated with acquisitions our growth strategy includes expanding our products and services  and we may seek acquisitions to expand our business 
we regularly review potential acquisitions of businesses  technologies or products complementary to our business and periodically engage in discussions regarding such possible acquisitions 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including some or all of the following substantial cash expenditures and capital investments  potentially dilutive issuance of equity securities  incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  amortization of certain intangible assets  difficulties in assimilating the operations and products of the acquired companies  diverting our management s attention away from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which we have limited or no direct experience  the inability to manage the growth expected for various acquisitions  potential loss of key employees of the acquired companies in the process of integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds  and combining different corporate cultures 
we cannot assure you that any acquisition will result in long term benefits to us or that our management will be able to effectively manage the acquired businesses 
we may also incorrectly judge the value or worth of an acquired company or business 
we have recently disposed or divested ourselves of several companies or lines of business that were acquired by us in the past few years  at a significant net loss to us 
costs of discontinued operations we have exited the telecommunications segment of our business and closed the teraoptix facility in westborough  massachusetts 
the facility  which is financed with a mortgage note  is being actively marketed 
the mortgage note payable has a balance at june  of million and a swap agreement to fix the interest rate on the mortgage at has a fair value at june  of million 
we intend to use the proceeds from the sale of the facility to pay down the mortgage note and swap agreement 
the facility has been valued at an estimated fair market value based on a third party appraisal 
the value of the facility is estimated at million  which is net of estimated selling expenses 
if we are unable to sell the facility for its estimated value  additional funds beyond the million estimated shortfall would be needed to pay down the related debts 
factors which could influence the actual amount of cash used to pay the related debts include a selling price which differs from the current estimated value  the timing of the sale of the facility  and changes in the value of the swap agreement  which is based on financial market conditions 
customer concentration  relationship with canon during fiscal   and  sales to canon inc and canon sales co  inc collectively  canon  our largest customer in those periods  accounted for   and of our net sales  respectively 
we expect that sales to canon will continue to represent a significant percentage of our net sales for the foreseeable future 
canon is an original investor in our company  the owner at september  of approximately of our outstanding shares of common stock  and is a distributor of certain of our products in the japanese market 
a reduction or delay in orders from this customer  including reductions or delays due to market  economic  or competitive conditions in the industries in which we serve  could have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations 
our customers  including canon  generally do not enter into long term agreements obligating them to purchase our products 
quarterly fluctuations our quarterly and annual operating results have varied in the past and may in the future vary significantly depending on factors such as the effect of our acquisitions and consequent integration  budgeting cycles of our customers  the size  timing and recognition of revenue from significant orders  increased competition  our ability to develop innovative products  the timing of new product releases by us or our competitors  market acceptance of our products  changes in our and our competitors pricing policies  changes in operating expenses and personnel changes  changes in our business strategy  and general economic factors 
due to these and other factors we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful 
you should not rely on our results for one quarter as any indication of our future performance 
in future periods our operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors 
if this occurs  the price of our common stock would likely decrease 
current conditions in the domestic and global economies are extremely uncertain 
as a result  it is difficult to estimate the level of growth for the economy as a whole or of capital expenditures in the semiconductor and industrial markets 
because all of the components of our budgeting and forecasting are dependent on estimates of spending within these markets  the prevailing economic uncertainty renders estimates of future revenue and expenses even more difficult than usual to make 
possible volatility of stock price we believe that factors such as the announcement of new products or technologies by us or our competitors  market conditions in the semiconductor and industrial markets  and quarterly fluctuations in financial results are expected to cause the market price of our common stock to vary substantially 
further  our net sales or results of operations in future quarters may be below the expectations of public market securities analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the common stock would likely decline 
in addition  historically the stock market has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices for many high technology companies and which often have been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
the market volatility may adversely affect the market price of shares of our common stock 
competition we face competition from a number of companies in all our markets  some of which have greater manufacturing and marketing capabilities  and greater financial  technological  and personnel resources 
in addition  we compete with the internal development efforts of our current and prospective customers  some of which may attempt to become vertically integrated 
our competitors can be expected to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive price performance characteristics 
competitive pressures may necessitate price reductions  which can adversely affect results of operations 
although we believe that we have certain technical and other advantages over some of our competitors  maintaining such advantages will require a continued high level of investment by our company in research and development and sales  marketing  and service 
there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments or that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain such competitive advantages 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the bases of competition in the industries in which we compete will not shift 
technological change and new product development the market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology 
our future success will continue to depend upon our ability to enhance our current products and to develop and introduce new products that keep pace with technological developments and evolving industry standards  respond to changes in customer requirements  and achieve market acceptance 
the development of new technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation  as well as the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends 
we commit significant financial and personnel resources on a continuous basis to redesign and enhance our instruments  systems  and components and upgrade our proprietary software technology incorporated in our products 
any failure by us to anticipate or respond adequately to technological developments and customer requirements  or any significant delays in product development or introduction  could have a material adverse effect on our business and impact our close relationships with customers 
this could have an impact on customers willingness to share proprietary information about their requirements and participate in collaborative efforts with us 
there can be no assurance that our customers will continue to provide us with timely access to such information  that we will be successful in developing and marketing new products and services or product and service enhancements on a timely basis  or respond effectively to technological changes or new product announcements by others 
in addition  there can be no assurance the new products and services or product enhancements  if any  which we developed will achieve market acceptance 
dependence on proprietary technology our success is heavily dependent upon our proprietary technology 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by us to protect our proprietary technology will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology by third parties or will be adequate under the laws of some foreign countries  which may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do laws of the united states 
in addition  there remains the possibility that others will reverse engineer our products in order to determine their method of operation and introduce competing products or that others will develop competing technology independently 
any such adverse circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
some of the markets in which we compete are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent litigation for financial gain that is based on patents with broad  and often questionable  application 
as the number of our products increase  the markets in which our products are sold expands  and the functionality of those products grows and overlaps with products offered by competitors  we believe that we may become increasingly subject to infringement claims 
although we do not believe any of our products or proprietary rights infringe the rights of third parties  there can be no assurance that infringement claims will not be asserted against us in the future or that any such claim will not result in costly litigation or require us to enter into royalty arrangements  which may not be available to us on commercially acceptable terms if at all 
dependence on key personnel our success depends in large part upon the continued services of many of our highly skilled personnel involved in management  research  development and engineering  sales and marketing  manufacturing  and support and upon our ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified employees 
our employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time 
competition for these individuals from a variety of employers  including our competitors and companies in computer or technology related industries  at times is intense 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our existing personnel or attract and retain additional personnel 
dependence on third party suppliers we are dependent on suppliers for raw materials and various electrical  mechanical  and optical supplies  including fiber and electronic components and modules 
if any relationship with a key supplier is terminated or if a supplier fails or is unable to provide reliable services or equipment and we are unable to reach suitable alternative solutions quickly  we may experience significant delays and additional costs in the manufacturing of our products 
if our key suppliers cease manufacturing the supplies we require  if their manufacturing operations are interrupted for any significant amount of time  or if they are unwilling to supply us for any other reason  including capacity restraints  then we may be at least temporarily unable to obtain these supplies  thus exposing us to significant delays and additional costs 
currently there are only a limited number of companies that are capable of supplying optical materials in the quantity and of the quality we require 
although we enter  either directly or through our contract manufacturers  into purchase orders with our suppliers based on our forecasts  we do not have any guaranteed supply arrangements with these suppliers 
moreover  as our demand for supplies increases  we may not be able to obtain these supplies in a timely manner 
if we are unable to obtain  either directly or through contract manufacturers  a sufficient amount of supplies  or if we experience any interruption in delivery of supplies  we could experience difficulties in obtaining alternative sources or in altering product designs to use alternative supplies 
revenues derived from international sales and foreign operations we sell our products internationally  primarily to customers in japan and throughout the pacific rim 
net sales to customers outside the americas primarily the united states accounted for   and of our net sales in each of the fiscal years ended june    and  respectively  and are expected to continue to account for a substantial percentage of our net sales 
international sales and foreign operations are subject to inherent risks  including the economic conditions in these various foreign countries and their trading partners  political instability  longer payment cycles  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  compliance with foreign laws  changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs or other barriers  difficulties in obtaining export licenses  staffing and managing foreign operations  exposure to currency exchange fluctuations  transportation delays  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
our sales and costs are negotiated and paid primarily in us dollars 
however  changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the value of the us dollar can render our products comparatively more expensive to the extent locally produced alternative products are available 
such conditions could negatively impact international sales of our products and foreign operations  as would changes in the general economic conditions in those markets 
for our sales which are based in local currency  we are exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations from the time customers are invoiced in local currency until collection occurs 
for fiscal  approximately of our sales were in foreign currency 
there can be no assurance that risks inherent in international sales and foreign operations will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the future 
backlog we schedule the production of our systems based in part upon order backlog 
due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules and cancellations of orders  our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period 
there can be no assurance that amounts included in backlog will ultimately result in future sales 
a reduction in backlog during any particular period  or the failure of our backlog to result in future sales could adversely affect our results of operations 
we have recently experienced a significant decrease in backlog over the past two fiscal years primarily due to the slowdown in the semiconductor market 
sales cycle our lengthy and variable qualification and sales cycle makes it difficult to predict the timing of a sale or whether a sale will be made  which may cause us to have excess manufacturing capacity or inventory and negatively impact our operating results 
as is typical in the industry  our customers generally expend significant efforts in evaluating and qualifying our products and manufacturing process 
this evaluation and qualification process frequently results in a lengthy sales cycle  typically ranging from three to six months and sometimes longer 
while our customers are evaluating our products and before they place an order with us  we may incur substantial sales  marketing  and research and development expenses  expend significant management efforts  increase manufacturing capacity and order long lead time supplies prior to receiving an order 
even after this evaluation process  it is possible that a potential customer will not purchase our products 
in addition  product purchases are frequently subject to unplanned processing and other delays  particularly with respect to larger customers for which our products represent a very small percentage of their overall purchase activity 
if we increase capacity and order supplies in anticipation of an order that does not materialize  our gross margins will decline and we will have to carry or write off excess inventory 
even if we receive an order  the additional manufacturing capacity that we add to service the customer s requirements may be underutilized in a subsequent quarter 
either situation could cause our results of operations to be adversely affected 
our long sales cycles also may cause our revenues and operating results to vary significantly and unexpectedly from quarter to quarter 
prediction of manufacturing requirements if we fail to predict our manufacturing requirements accurately  we could incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays  which could cause us to lose orders or customers and result in lower net sales 
we currently use a rolling month forecast based primarily on our anticipated product orders and our product order history to help determine our requirements for components and materials 
it is very important that we accurately predict both the demand for our products and the lead time required to obtain the necessary components and raw materials 
lead times for materials and components that we order vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier  the size of the order  contract terms  and demand for each component at a given time 
if we underestimate our requirements  we may have inadequate manufacturing capacity or inventory  which could interrupt manufacturing of our products and result in delays in shipments and net sales 
if we overestimate our requirements  we could have excess inventory of parts 
we also may experience shortages of components from time to time  which also could delay the manufacturing of our products and could cause us to lose orders or customers 
undetected product defects our products are deployed in large and complex systems and may contain defects that are not detected until after our products have been installed  which could damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers 
we design some of our products for deployment in large and complex optical networks 
because of the nature of these products  they can only be fully tested for reliability when deployed in networks for long periods of time 
our customers may discover defects in our products only after they have been fully deployed and operated under peak stress conditions 
in addition  our products are combined with products from other vendors 
as a result  should problems occur  it might be difficult to identify the source of the problem 
these conditions increase the risk that we could experience  among other things loss of customers  damage to our brand reputation  failure to attract new customers or achieve market acceptance  diversion of development and engineering resources  and legal actions by our customers 
the occurrence of any one or more of the foregoing factors could cause us to experience losses  incur liabilities  and cause our net sales to decline 
environmental regulations environmental regulations applicable to our manufacturing operations could limit our ability to expand or subject us to substantial costs 
we are subject to a variety of environmental regulations relating to the use  storage  discharge  and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during our manufacturing processes 
any failure by us to comply with present and future regulations could subject us to future liabilities or the suspension of production 
in addition  such regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the following discussion about our market risk involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity we maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities including institutional money market funds which may include commercial paper  certificates of deposit  and us treasury securities  government agency securities  and corporate bonds 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly on our short term instruments 
the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for the company s investment portfolio 
fair value of investments as of june  maturing in cash and cash equivalents fixed rate weighted average interest rate marketable securities fixed rate weighted average interest rate during fiscal we entered into a mortgage on our westborough facility of million at an interest rate of the one month libor rate plus a variable rate component based on a certain debt ratio in total at june  
as of june   the mortgage loan had a balance of million 
in conjunction with the mortgage  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that provides for a fixed interest rate of in place of the libor component for the duration of the mortgage 
the variable rate component based on a certain debt ratio can vary from to as of june  
we estimate that a change in applicable market interest rates would increase or decrease the fair value of the swap agreement by approximately million 
exchange rate sensitivity approximately of our fiscal sales were in us dollars 
at june   our backlog included orders in us dollars of million  or of the total backlog 
substantially all of our costs are negotiated and paid in us dollars 
significant changes in the values of foreign currencies relative to the value of the us dollar can impact sales of our products in export markets as would changes in the general economic conditions in those markets 
for our sales which are based in local currency  we are exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations from the time customers are invoiced in local currency until collection occurs 
the majority of our foreign currency transactions are in euro and japanese yen 
a appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar against the euro and yen would have an immaterial impact on our financial position and results of operations
