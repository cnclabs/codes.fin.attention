overview we are a premier provider of executive search and leadership consulting services 
we help our clients build leadership teams by facilitating the recruitment  development and retention of personnel for their executive management positions 
in addition to executive search  we provide other leadership services  including executive assessment  placement of interim executive management and  through an alliance  executive coaching 
during and  the executive search industry experienced a dramatic increase in demand for its services in virtually all markets based on increased competition for executive talent  the need for executives with diverse and global leadership skills  and the proliferation of internet and e commerce businesses 
our rate of growth in net revenue during this period exceeded both the industry trend and our historical average because of the need for management at start up companies  the creation of new e commerce positions at more established companies and the growth in the financial services industry 
we responded to these trends by increasing the number of consultants and the number of offices from which we served our clients 
in  we added more than consultants  including consultants experienced in executive search and employees from other disciplines who were new to the search profession  in anticipation of a continuation of increased demand 
also  in response to the demand in internet enhanced mid level search  in march  we launched our mid level recruiting business as a separate subsidiary called leadersonline 
the slowdown in the united states economy that began early in  especially in the financial services and technology sectors  followed by a slowdown in other geographic markets  created an environment where the previous trends began to reverse 
commencing in june  when we anticipated a decrease in net revenue compared to  we took steps to reduce our cost base by reducing our workforce while retaining capacity to meet additional demand when the economy recovered 
in october  we announced further reductions in our workforce and consolidated or eliminated office space 
the initiatives related to these announcements were completed during the first quarter  including the integration of leadersonline into our executive search business 

table of contents in  the worldwide economies  and the demand for executive search services  continued to weaken 
even after taking into account the workforce reductions and office consolidations and closings which occurred since june  at the current and anticipated near term net revenue levels  we determined that we had substantial excess search team capacity 
in addition  the cost structure in europe continued to be too high for its net revenue level 
as a result  in october  we announced further reductions in our workforce and additional office consolidations and closings 
the turbulent geopolitical situation and its effects on the worldwide economy continue to create uncertainty in the business environment 
for  we expect net revenue to be flat to down modestly compared to the corresponding operating margins at that net revenue level are expected to be to percent 
results of operations we operate our executive search and complementary leadership services in four geographic regions north america  which includes the united states except miami and canada  latin america  which includes mexico and the rest of latin america  as well as miami  which serves as our gateway office to the region  europe  and asia pacific 
as of january  we completed the integration of leadersonline  our mid level management recruiting service  into our executive search business 
as a result  we no longer report leadersonline as a separate segment 
as leadersonline was north america based  the net revenue and operating income loss have been included as part of the north america region 
we adopted emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred  eitf no 
in  which requires that reimbursements of out of pocket expenses be reported on a gross basis as revenue and as operating expenses 
historically  the reimbursements of out of pocket expenses were classified as a reduction of operating expenses 
the change in presentation has no impact on our consolidated operating income loss 
for segment purposes  the revenue from reimbursements is reported on a separate line  and therefore does not affect the analysis of net revenue by geographic region 
the presentation required by eitf no 
has no impact on the operating income loss of the geographic regions 
prior period disclosures were revised to reflect the above changes

the application of certain of these policies requires significant judgments or an estimation process that may affect our results of operations  financial position and cash flows  as well as the related footnote disclosures 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable 
if actual amounts are ultimately different from previous estimates  the revisions are included in our results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known 
the accounting policies and estimates with the greatest potential to have a significant impact on our operating results  financial position  cash flows and footnote disclosures are as follows revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  and its related interpretations 
revenue before reimbursements for out of pocket expenses net revenue is recognized when earned and realizable and therefore when the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  services have been rendered  the fee to our client is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
net revenue consists of retainers and indirect expenses billed to clients 
typically  we are paid a retainer for our executive search services equal to approximately one third of the estimated first year compensation of the position to be filled 
if actual compensation of the placed candidate exceeds the estimated compensation  we are generally authorized to bill the client for one third of the excess 
net revenue from executive search engagements is recognized over the expected period of performance  in proportion to the estimated personnel time incurred to fulfill our obligations under the arrangements 
net revenue in excess of the retainer  resulting from actual compensation of the placed candidate exceeding estimated compensation  is recognized upon completion of the executive search when the amount of the additional fee is known 
our assumptions about the duration of the time and extent of efforts for search teams to complete our services in an executive search engagement require significant judgment as these variables have fluctuated in the past and are expected to continue to do so 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts receivable from our customers are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in existing accounts receivable balances 
we determine the allowance for doubtful accounts through an analysis of several factors  including the aging of our accounts receivable  historical write off experience  and specific account analyses 
we consider current and projected economic conditions and historical trends when determining the allowance for doubtful accounts 
actual collections of accounts receivable could differ from our estimates due to changes in future economic or industry conditions or specific customers financial condition 
accruals related to the consolidation and closing of offices recorded as part of our special charges 
in october  october and june  we announced cost reduction initiatives to better align costs with expected revenue levels 
these initiatives included the consolidation and closing of offices where we had long term leases 
at the time of the office closings and consolidations  we accrued the estimated costs associated with these actions 
the accruals were established in accordance with eitf no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  and staff accounting bulletin no 
 restructuring and impairment charges 
inherent in these accruals are estimates concerning vacancy periods  expected sublease income  and costs to terminate the leases 
these accruals are periodically updated to reflect information concerning the commercial real estate markets in which the related offices are located 
we believe that the accounting estimate related to accruals for the consolidation and closing of offices is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to changes in the commercial real estate markets and the local regional economic factors where this leased office space is located 
income taxes 
deferred taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between financial and income tax reporting using tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
as of december   we concluded that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets  net of existing valuation allowances  will be realized through the generation of future taxable income 
in making this assessment  we consider expected sources of future taxable income arising from the scheduled reversal of temporary differences that have generated deferred tax liabilities  projected taxable income from operations  tax planning strategies and the expected future expiration dates of tax loss carryforwards 
we incurred taxable losses in and  primarily resulting from special charges recorded as a result of aligning the cost structure with expected revenue levels 
valuation allowances have been established against foreign tax credits and tax benefits attributable to loss carryforwards in certain foreign jurisdictions with expiration periods ranging from three to ten years 
our evaluation of the realizability of deferred tax assets is based on current assumptions and estimates 
we periodically review these assumptions and estimates based on projected operating results for tax jurisdictions where we have significant deferred tax assets 
the timing and strength of an economic recovery in the united states and other areas of the world continues to be unclear 
further economic declines in future periods may impact our ability to realize the deferred tax assets

table of contents item a

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and its subsequent amendments 
the warrants are recorded at fair value  net of consultants bonuses 
in accordance with sfas no 
 changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations

currency market risk 
with our operations primarily in north america  latin america  europe and asia pacific we conduct business using various currencies 
revenue earned in each country is generally matched with the associated expenses incurred  thereby reducing currency risk to earnings 
however  because certain assets and liabilities are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  changes in currency rates may cause fluctuations in the valuation of such assets and liabilities 
historically  we have not experienced significant gains or losses on transactions involving us dollars and other currencies 
as the local currency of our subsidiaries has been designated as the functional currency  we are affected by the translation of foreign currency financial statements into us dollars 
outside of north america  europe is our largest region in terms of net revenue 
based on our net loss of million  a change in the average exchange rate of the british pound and the euro would have increased or decreased our net loss by approximately million
