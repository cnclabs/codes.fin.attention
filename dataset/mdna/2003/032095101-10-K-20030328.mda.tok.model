the company has a bank loan agreement bank agreement which includes a term loan  consisting of a tranche a and b  and a million revolving credit facility 
at december   the tranche a had a balance of million and matures over the period to  and the tranche b had a balance of million and matures over the period and the revolving credit facility expires in  and  availability under the facility at december  was million  after reduction of million for outstanding letters of credit 
the bank agreement is secured by a first priority pledge of of the capital stock of the company s direct domestic subsidiaries and of the capital stock of direct material foreign subsidiaries  as defined in the bank agreement 
the bank agreement also requires that the company satisfy certain financial covenants including interest coverage and leverage ratio tests  and includes limitations with respect to  among other things  indebtedness and restricted payments  including dividends on the company s common stock 
the company is currently pursuing a refinancing of its senior credit facilities 
the new credit facilities would be used to replace the company s existing credit facilities  and may be used to redeem all or a portion of the company s outstanding senior subordinated notes 
a subsidiary of the company has an agreement with a financial institution whereby the subsidiary can sell an undivided interest of up to million in a designated pool of qualified accounts receivable 
the agreement expires in may with respect to million of accounts receivable and expires in july with respect to an additional million of accounts receivable 
at december   approximately million of receivables were sold under the agreement and are therefore not reflected in the accounts receivable balance in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
the company s primary ongoing cash requirements will be for operating and capital expenditures  product development activities and debt service 
the company s debt service requirements consist primarily of principal and interest on bank borrowings and interest on its senior subordinated notes due notes 
the company s primary sources of liquidity are internally generated cash flow  the company s revolving credit facility and the sale of receivables under the company s accounts receivable agreement 
the company expects that ongoing requirements for operating and capital expenditures  product development activities and debt service requirements will be funded from these sources  however  the company s sources of liquidity could be adversely affected by a decrease in demand for the company s products  a deterioration in certain of the company s financial ratios or a deterioration in the quality of the company s accounts receivable 
the company has not paid  and does not have any present intention to commence payment of  cash dividends on its common stock 
the company expects that capital expenditures in will be approximately million 
the company s required debt and capital lease amortization in is million  the company s required cash interest payments for  at current interest rates  are estimated at approximately million 
the company may also use cash to fund part or all of the cost of future acquisitions 
disclosures about contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes the company s known obligations to make future payments pursuant to certain contracts as of december   as well as an estimate of the timing in which these obligations are expected to be satisfied contractual obligations dollars in thousands total less than year years years more than years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total environmental matters subsequent to the acquisition of amphenol from allied signal corporation in allied signal merged with honeywell international inc in december honeywell  amphenol and honeywell have been named jointly and severally liable as potentially responsible parties in relation to several environmental cleanup sites 
amphenol and honeywell have jointly consented to perform certain investigations and remedial and monitoring activities at two sites and they have been jointly ordered to perform work at another site 
the responsibility for costs incurred relating to these three sites is apportioned between amphenol and honeywell based on an agreement entered into in connection with the acquisition in for sites covered by this agreement  to the extent that conditions or circumstances occurred or existed at the time of or prior to the acquisition  honeywell is currently obligated to pay of the costs up to million and of the costs in excess of million 
at december   approximately million of costs have been incurred applicable to this agreement 
honeywell representatives work closely with the company in addressing the most significant environmental liabilities 
management does not believe that the costs associated with resolution of these or any other environmental matters will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
inflation and costs the cost of the company s products is influenced by the cost of a wide variety of raw materials  including precious metals such as gold and silver used in plating  aluminum  copper  brass and steel used for contacts  shells and cable  and plastic materials used in molding connector bodies  inserts and cable 
in general  increases in the cost of raw materials  labor and services have been offset by price increases  productivity improvements and cost saving programs 
risk management the company has to a significant degree mitigated its exposure to currency risk in its business operations by manufacturing and procuring its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold so that costs reflect local economic conditions 
in other cases involving us export sales  raw materials are a significant component of product costs for the majority of such sales and raw material costs are generally dollar based on a worldwide scale  such as basic metals and petroleum derived materials

pensions the company and its domestic subsidiaries have a defined benefit pension plan plan covering substantially all us employees 
plan benefits are generally based on years of service and compensation and are generally noncontributory 
certain foreign subsidiaries also have defined benefit plans covering their employees 
our pension cost credit for all pension plans approximated 
million  
million and 
million in   and  respectively  and is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions established on january of the applicable year  including an expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
in developing our expected long term rate of return assumption  we evaluated input from our actuaries and investment consultants as well as long term inflation assumptions 
projected returns by such consultants are based on broad equity and bond indices 
we also considered our historical year compounded return of  which has been in excess of these broad equity and bond benchmark indices 
our expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of with equity managers  with an expected long term rate of return of  with fixed income managers  with an expected long term rate of return of and with high yield bond managers  with an expected rate of return of 
because of market fluctuation  our actual asset allocation as of december  was with equity managers and with fixed income managers  including high yield managers 
we believe  however  that our long term asset allocation on average will approximate with equity managers and with fixed income managers 
we regularly review our actual asset allocation and periodically rebalance our investments to our targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
based on this methodology the company reduced the expected long term rate of return assumption by basis points to beginning in this will have the effect of increasing pension expense in by approximately million 
the discount rate used by the company for valuing pension liabilities is based on a review of high quality corporate bond yields with maturities approximating the remaining life of the projected benefit obligations 
the discount rate on this basis has decreased from at december  to at december  this will have the effect of increasing pension expense in by approximately million 
although future changes to the discount rate are unknown  had the discount rate increased or decreased basis points  the pension liability would have decreased million or increased million  respectively 
the financial markets have declined significantly in recent years  which has had an adverse effect on plan assets 
in  this resulted in a million non cash charge to the accumulated other comprehensive loss account component of stockholders equity 
such charge represents an increase in the accrued pension liabilities of million  net of deferred taxes 
the company estimates that  based on current actuarial calculations  it will make a cash contribution to the pension plans in of approximately million 
cash contributions in subsequent years will depend on a number of factors including the investment performance of plan assets 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company s significant accounting policies are set forth below 
revenue recognition sales and related cost of sales are recognized upon shipment of products 
allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts  discounts  returns and allowances are provided based upon historical experience  current trends and specific information which indicates that an allowance is appropriate 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost  which approximates average cost  or market 
provisions for slow moving and obsolete inventory are provided based on historical experience and product demand 
depreciable assets property  plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation 
the appropriateness and the recoverability of the carrying value of such assets is periodically reviewed taking into consideration current and expected business conditions 
the significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company  in the normal course of doing business  is exposed to the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the company conducts business in several international currencies through its worldwide operations  and as a result is subject to foreign exchange exposures due to changes in exchange rates of the various currencies 
changes in exchange rates can positively or negatively effect the company s sales  gross margins and retained earnings 
the company attempts to minimize currency exposure risk by producing its products in the same country or region in which the products are sold and thereby generating revenues and incurring expenses in the same currency and by managing its working capital  although there can be no assurance that this approach will be successful  especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of any of the international currencies of the company s worldwide operations 
the company does not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes 
interest rate risk the company is subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on its financing activities 
the company has utilized interest rate swap agreements to manage and mitigate its exposure to changes in interest rates 
the company had two fixed rate interest swap agreements totaling million that expired in at december   the company s average libor rate was 
a change in the libor interest rate at december  would have the effect of increasing or decreasing interest expense by approximately 
million 
the company does not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in  although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly change
