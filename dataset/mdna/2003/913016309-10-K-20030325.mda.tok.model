item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview we operate surgery centers and private surgical hospitals in the united states and western europe 
as of december   we operated facilities  consisting of in the united states  eight in spain  and two in the united kingdom 
of the us facilities  are jointly owned with ten major not for profit healthcare systems 
overall  as of december   we held ownership interests in of the facilities and operated the remaining three facilities  all in the united states  under management contracts 
for the year ended december   our first full year in operation  we generated million of revenues  a million operating loss and million of ebitda less minority interest 
for the year ended december   our revenues had grown to million  we generated million of operating income and our ebitda less minority interests had grown to million 
critical accounting policies our management is required to make certain estimates and assumptions during the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
these estimates and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements 
they also impact the reported amount of net earnings during any period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
certain of our accounting policies and estimates have a more significant impact on our financial statements than others  due to the size of the underlying financial statement elements 
consolidation our determination of the appropriate consolidation method to follow with respect to our investments in subsidiaries and affiliates is based on the amount of control we have  combined with our ownership level  in the underlying entity 
our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company  its wholly owned subsidiaries  and other subsidiaries over which we have control 
our investments in subsidiaries in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies  but do not control including subsidiaries where we have less than ownership are accounted for on the equity method 
all of our other investments are accounted for on the cost method 
accounting for an investment as either consolidated versus equity method generally has no impact on our net income or stockholders equity in any accounting period  but does impact individual income statement and balance sheet balances  as consolidation effectively grosses up our income statement and balance sheet 
however  if control or influence aspects of an equity method investment were different  it could result in us being required to account for an investment by consolidation or using the cost method 
under the cost method  the investor only records its share of the underlying entity s earnings to the extent that it received dividends or distributions from the investee 
under the cost method  the investor does not record its share of income or losses of the investee 
conversely  under either consolidation or equity method accounting  the investor effectively records its share of the underlying entity s net income or loss based on its ownership percentage 
at december   million of the company s total investment in unconsolidated affiliates of million relates to investments that are accounted for using the cost method and the remaining million represents investments in unconsolidated affiliates accounted for using the equity method 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  which has four basic criteria that must be met before revenue is recognized existence of persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
our revenue recognition policies are consistent with these criteria 
our revenues that are subject to the most judgment are those patient service revenues that are not generated under contracted or government mandated fee schedules or discount arrangements 
approximately of our net revenues for the year ended december  were generated by noncontracted and nongovernment payors 
the allowances that we record for these revenues are based on our best estimates of expected actual reimbursement based primarily on historical collections for similar transactions 
income taxes management accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
if  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets may not be realized  deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance 
intangible assets beginning january   we also consider our accounting policy regarding intangible assets to be a critical accounting policy given the significance of intangible assets as compared to our total assets and the recent changes in accounting for intangible assets required under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 which was issued by the financial accounting standards board on july  and was adopted by us as of january  sfas no 
requires the cessation of amortization of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets which do not have finite lives and requires that all intangible assets be tested for impairment at least annually 
we adopted this standard on january   which did not result in impairment in any of our reporting units  which we determined to be at our operating segment country level 
acquisitions  equity investments and development projects in march  we acquired a surgical hospital in marbella  spain  for approximately million in cash 
in addition  we agreed to pay up to an additional total of million to the sellers  depending on the resolution of certain contingencies over the next four years 
during  four surgery centers and two private surgical hospitals developed by us in the united states opened and began performing cases 
in december  we acquired an additional of a surgery center in torrance  california  in which we had previously been a minority owner  for million in cash  bringing our total ownership in the facility to and triggering our consolidation of the facility in our financial statements 
in october  we acquired an interest in a surgery center in lyndhurst  ohio  for million in cash 
in august  with an effective date of july   we acquired an additional interest in a surgery center in arlington  texas arlington for total consideration of million  consisting of million in cash and million of our common stock  bringing our total ownership interest in the center to 
because we own a majority of a subsidiary that owns a majority of the surgery center and maintains effective control through this ownership interest and through our operation of the center pursuant to a management contract  we consolidated the results of arlington s operations in our financial statements 
in june  we acquired a interest in a surgery center in middleburg heights  ohio  a suburb of cleveland  for million in cash 
in may  we acquired a interest in a surgery center in corpus christi  texas for million in cash 
in march  we acquired surgicoe corporation  which owns  manages  and develops surgical facilities in georgia  oklahoma  and texas 
we paid the shareholders of surgicoe approximately million in cash 
the terms of the agreement provide for us to make additional payments in the future should certain facilities  including some that are operational and some that are currently under development  meet specified performance targets 
in february  we acquired a surgical hospital in murcia  spain  for total consideration of approximately million in cash of which million was paid upon the consummation of the acquisition and million will be paid on the first anniversary of the consummation of the acquisition and approximately million in assumed capital lease obligations 
we also engage in investing transactions that are not business combinations  consisting primarily of purchases and sales of noncontrolling equity interests in surgical facilities and the investment of additional cash in surgical facilities under development 
during the year ended december   these transactions resulted in net cash outflows of million 
the most notable transactions were acquisitions of noncontrolling interests in surgery centers in the following markets austintown  ohio  the first of three centers we began operating in northern ohio in  destin  florida  which is our third center in florida  east brunswick  new jersey  through a newly formed joint venture with robert wood johnson university hospital  and atlanta  georgia  where we increased our existing ownership in one of the six facilities we operate in georgia 
during the fourth quarter of  we acquired ownership interests in four surgery centers through separate transactions  expanding to three additional markets in the us in october  we acquired a interest in a surgical facility in sarasota  florida for a total consideration of approximately million in cash and approximately million in assumed debt 
during november  we completed two acquisitions an interest in a surgical facility in west covina  california los angeles area for a total consideration of approximately million in cash and approximately million in assumed debt and an interest in a surgical facility in fredericksburg  virginia  for a total consideration of approximately million in cash  a warrant to acquire  shares of our common stock at a price equal to approximately per share and approximately  in assumed debt 
in december  we expanded our presence in the los angeles area by acquiring a interest in a surgical facility in torrance  california for a total consideration of approximately million 
during july  we acquired a controlling interest in a surgery center in fort worth  texas for approximately million in cash 
we had previously operated this surgery center under a management contract 
in addition  in july and august  we opened newly developed surgery centers in knoxville  tennessee  and lawrenceville  georgia 
on february   we completed a merger with ortholink 
the transaction was funded through the issuance of  shares of our common stock to ortholink stockholders 
ortholink was incorporated in and  as of february   held a direct or indirect ownership interest in eight surgery centers 
we also held an ownership interest in and managed one of these centers 
ortholink managed six of the eight surgery centers in which it held an ownership interest and managed two additional surgery centers in which it had no ownership interest 
in addition  ortholink has service agreements with physician groups in six states 
ortholink s physician practice management operations are not  and are not expected to be in the future  a material part of our business 
in april  we acquired of the outstanding common stock of aspen healthcare holdings limited that owns and operates two private surgical hospitals in england 
we paid approximately million in cash for that acquisition  approximately million of which we borrowed under a credit agreement denominated in british pounds with a commercial lender 
additionally  during  we acquired two hospitals and a radiology center in madrid  spain through three separate transactions 
we paid approximately million for these three acquisitions 
also  during  we opened two newly developed surgery centers in the united states 
sources of revenue revenues primarily include net patient service revenue for the facilities that we consolidate for financial reporting purposes  which are typically those in which we have ownership interests of greater than or otherwise maintain effective control  management and administrative services revenue earned from management contracts  whereby we manage the operations of surgical facilities in which we have varying levels of ownership  and from contracts to provide consulting and specific administrative services to physicians 
management services revenue and expenses earned from and incurred by facilities that we consolidate for financial reporting purposes are eliminated in consolidation and therefore not included in management services revenue or operating expenses in our consolidated statements of operations and accordingly have no impact on consolidated net income  and our share of the net income or loss of the unconsolidated facilities that we account for under the equity method of accounting 
these amounts are included in revenues as these operations are central to our business strategy 
through our contracts to manage these facilities  we have an active role in their operations 
the level of our corporate resources devoted to fulfilling these responsibilities is significant and generally equal to that devoted to the operations of the facilities we consolidate for financial reporting purposes 
the following table summarizes our revenues by type and as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated dollars in thousands years ended december  net patient service revenue management and administrative services revenue equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates other income total revenue the percentage of our total revenues attributable to management and administrative services decreased to for the year ended december  from for primarily as a result of the additional net patient service revenue resulting from our acquiring controlling interests in surgical facilities during and this percentage had increased to for the year ended december  from for primarily as a result of the additional management and administrative services associated with managing unconsolidated facilities and service agreements added by the acquisition of ortholink in february our management and administrative services revenues are earned from the following types of activities year ended december  management of surgical facilities    consulting and other services provided to physicians and related entities total management and administrative service revenues   the majority of our management and administrative services revenue earned from providing services to physicians and related entities resulted from our acquisition of ortholink physicians corporation ortholink february  our results for the year ended december  include only ten and one half months of ortholink operations

our weighted average percentage ownership in our unconsolidated affiliates calculated based on the total debt of each affiliate multiplied by the percentage ownership uspi held in the affiliate as of the end of each respective year 
for the year ended december   approximately of our revenues were generated from operations in the united stated and from western europe 
for and  these percentages were and for the united states and and for western europe  respectively 
the increase in the percentage of our revenues generated in the united states and corresponding decrease in western europe resulted from focusing our development and acquisition activities primarily in the united states during and results of operations the following table summarizes certain statements of operations items expressed as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated years ended december  total revenues operating expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization ebitda minority interest in income of consolidated subsidiaries depreciation and amortization interest and other expense  net a income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss a reflects a reclassification of a loss on early retirement of debt that was classified as an extraordinary item in  but has been reclassified to interest and other expense  net in this presentation  reflecting our adoption of sfas no 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  of this increase  million was contributed by facilities acquired or opened since december  the us dollar was weaker relative to the eurodollar and the british pound during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in the prior year  resulting in a positive impact of million on year over year revenues for the facilities in western europe that we owned in both and same store facilities 
absent this foreign exchange impact  same store facilities in western europe contributed million more to consolidated revenue in the year ended december  as compared to the same period in the remaining increase in revenues was contributed principally by same store us facilities  which performed approximately more cases during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  operating expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization  increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  operating expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization  as a percentage of revenues  decreased to from  primarily as a result of increasing revenue base  operating efficiencies at our facilities and improved economies of scale as we expanded 
ebitda less minority interest increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  of this increase in ebitda less minority interest  million was contributed by facilities acquired or opened since december  ebitda less minority interest  as a percentage of revenues  increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december   primarily as a result of improved operating margins at our facilities and the leveraging of our corporate overhead expenses over the increased revenue 
depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this amount remained virtually constant because the reduction in expense resulting from the cessation of goodwill amortization required under sfas no 
largely offset the additional depreciation on tangible assets acquired through acquisitions 
depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenues decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  due to our increased revenue 
interest expense  net of interest income  increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of higher levels of outstanding debt during the year ended december  than during the prior year period 
we used a portion of the proceeds of our two public offerings of common stock to repay senior and subordinated indebtedness in june and have incurred debt to fund a portion of our acquisition and development program since that time 
other expense  net of other income decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily due to the million loss on early retirement of debt recorded in being so much larger than the million impairment of investment securities recorded in provision for income taxes was a net expense of million  representing an effective tax rate of  for the year ended december   compared to a net benefit of million  representing a negative effective tax rate of  for the year ended december  the increase in our actual provision for income taxes and in our overall effective tax rate primarily results from our accruing no net federal tax expense related to us operations prior to january   at which time we began accruing taxes at rates approximating statutory rates 
we utilized net operating loss carryforwards nols to offset current period income as our us operations achieved profitability for the first time during  and during the fourth quarter of we fully recognized the benefit of all us nols generated during our initial years of operations 
net income was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this million improvement results primarily from the increased revenues and improved economies of scale related to expenses discussed above 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  of this increase in revenues  million was contributed by facilities acquired since december   of which million was contributed by ortholink 
an additional million was attributable to revenue generated in the first quarter of fiscal by the two hospitals in the united kingdom 
these hospitals were acquired on april  the exchange rates of the european currencies to the us dollar were lower during the year ended december  as compared to the prior year  resulting in a negative impact of million on year over year revenues for the facilities in western europe that were owned in both and same store facilities 
absent this foreign exchange impact  same store facilities in western europe contributed million more to consolidated revenue in the year ended december  as compared to the remaining increase in revenues was contributed by same store us facilities  which performed approximately more cases in the year ended december  as compared to operating expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization  increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for operating expenses  excluding depreciation and amortization  as a percentage of revenues  decreased to for the year ended december  from for  primarily as a result of improved economies of scale as we expanded 
ebitda less minority interest increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for of this increase in ebitda less minority interest  million was contributed by facilities acquired since december  ebitda less minority interest  as a percentage of revenues  increased to for the year ended december  from for  primarily as a result of an improvement of operating margins at our facilities operated in joint ventures with healthcare systems and the leveraging of our corporate overhead expenses over the increased revenue 
depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for as a result of amortization of the goodwill and other intangibles and depreciation of the additional property and equipment associated with the acquisitions completed during and depreciation and amortization  as a percentage of revenues  increased to for the year ended december  from for  primarily as a result of the amortization of management contracts and other intangibles associated with the ortholink acquisition 
in accordance with a preadoption requirement of sfas no 
 we did not amortize goodwill resulting from acquisitions consumated after june  interest expense  net of interest income  increased to million for the year ended december  from million for  primarily as a result of the debt assumed in connection with the ortholink acquisition and additional borrowings to finance other acquisitions during and other expense  net of other income  increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for  primarily as a result of our recording a million loss on early retirement of debt in  as a result of the early termination of our credit facility in spain and the retirement of the senior subordinated notes of usp domestic holdings  inc  one of our wholly owned subsidiaries  using the proceeds of our million senior subordinated debt offering 
the items included in the loss consisted primarily of unamortized debt issuance costs of the spain credit facility and unamortized discount related to the senior subordinated notes 
provision for income taxes was a benefit of million for the year ended december  and expense of million for our tax provision for both years consists primarily of taxes on income generated in the uk  spanish taxes on the income of entities that were not eligible for inclusion in the consolidated tax group in that country and state income taxes in the us as of december   the benefit of essentially all us net operating losses that were not subject to significant change in control limitations have been recognized in our financial statements  resulting in a net tax benefit for  and we expect our effective tax rate in future periods will more closely approximate statutory rates 
net income was million for the year december  as compared to a net loss of million for this million improvement primarily results from the increased revenues and improved economies of scale related to expenses discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources during november  we entered into a second amended and restated credit facility with a group of commercial lenders providing us with the ability to borrow up to million for acquisitions and general corporate purposes in the united states and spain or for any new subsidiary that becomes a guarantor of the facility 
a total of million of borrowings under the facility may be used by subsidiaries that are not guarantors  including subsidiaries in the united kingdom 
borrowings under our second amended and restated credit facility mature on november  as of december   no amounts were outstanding under this facility and million was available for borrowing based on actual reported consolidated financial results 
maximum availability under the facility is based upon pro forma ebitda including ebitda from acquired entities 
assuming historical purchase multiples of annual ebitda of potential acquisition targets  approximately million would be available for borrowing to finance acquisitions as of december   of which none was drawn at december  our second amended and restated credit facility agreement and the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes contain various restrictive covenants including covenants that limit our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to borrow money or guarantee other indebtedness  grant liens on our assets  make investments  use assets as security in other transactions  pay dividends on stock  enter into sale and leaseback transactions or sell assets or capital stock 
in october  we received  after offering costs of approximately million  net proceeds of approximately million from an offering of million shares of our common stock  which included  shares attributable to the underwriters exercise of their over allotment option 
net proceeds were used as follows to repay the million balance then outstanding under our primary credit agreement 
to acquire an interest in a surgery center in lyndhurst  ohio  for million in cash 
to acquire an additional interest in surgery center in atlanta  georgia  in which we already held a interest  for million in cash 
to acquire an additional interest in a surgery center in torrance  california  in which we already held a interest  for million in cash 
the remaining net proceeds have been and will be used for other acquisitions  development of new facilities and general corporate purposes 
during the year ended december   we generated million of cash flows from operations as compared to million during and million during during the year ended december   our net cash required for investing activities was million  consisting primarily of million for the purchase of businesses and million for the purchase of property and equipment 
the million primarily represents purchases of new businesses  net of cash received  and incremental investments in unconsolidated affiliates 
the most significant of these transactions were the million paid for the surgery center in corpus christi  texas  the million paid to acquire the surgery center in lyndhurst  ohio  the million paid to acquire the additional interest in the surgery center in torrance  california  the million paid for the surgical hospital in murcia  spain  the million paid to acquire the additional interest in the surgery center in arlington  texas  and the million paid to acquire surgicoe 
approximately million of the property and equipment purchases related to ongoing development projects  and the remaining million primarily represents purchases of equipment at existing facilities 
the million of cash required for investing activities was funded with the cash flows from operations noted above and borrowings under our credit facilities  which were subsequently repaid with the proceeds from our stock offering 
net cash provided during the year ended december  by financing activities totaled million and resulted primarily from proceeds of a stock offering 
cash and cash equivalents were million at december  as compared to million at december  and net working capital was million at december  as compared to million in the prior year 
the credit agreement in the united kingdom provides for total borrowings of million approximately million as of december  under three separate facilities 
at december   total outstanding borrowings under this credit agreement were approximately million and approximately million was available for borrowings 
borrowings under the united kingdom credit facility bear interest at rates of to over libor and mature in april we pledged the capital stock of our uk subsidiaries to secure borrowings under the united kingdom credit facility 
we were in compliance with all covenants under our credit agreements as of december  our obligations under debt and lease contracts as of december  may be summarized as follows payments due by period in thousands contractual cash obligations total within year to years to years beyond years long term debt senior subordinated notes   us credit facility uk credit facility      loans from former owners of subsidiaries  other debt at operating subsidiaries    capitalized lease obligations us operating subsidiaries     western europe operating subsidiaries    operating lease obligations us operating subsidiaries     western europe operating subsidiaries    total contractual cash obligations    our operating subsidiaries  many of which have minority owners who share in the cash flow of these entities  have debt consisting primarily of capitalized lease obligations 
this debt is generally non recourse to uspi  the parent company  and is generally secured by the assets of those operating entities 
the total amount of these obligations  which was million at december   is included in our consolidated balance sheet because the borrower or obligated entity meets the requirements for consolidated financial reporting 
our average percentage ownership  weighted based on the individual subsidiary s amount of debt and capitalized leased obligations  of these consolidated subsidiaries was at december  additionally  our unconsolidated affiliates that we account for under the equity method have debt and capitalized lease obligations that are generally non recourse to uspi and are not included in our consolidated financial statements 
at december   the total obligations of these unconsolidated affiliates under debt and capital lease obligations was approximately million 
our average percentage ownership  weighted based on the individual affiliate s amount of debt and capitalized lease obligations  of these unconsolidated affiliates was at december  uspi or one of its wholly owned subsidiaries had collectively guaranteed million of the million in total debt and capital lease obligations of our unconsolidated affiliates as of december  these unconsolidated affiliates are limited partnerships  limited liability partnerships or limited liability companies that own operational surgical facilities or surgical facilities that are under development 
none of these affiliates provide financing  liquidity  or market or credit risk support for us 
they also do not engage in leasing  hedging  research and development services with us 
moreover  we do not believe that they expose us to any of their liabilities that are not otherwise reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
we are not obligated to fund losses or otherwise provide additional funding to these affiliates other than as we determine to be economically required in order to successfully implement our development plans 
currently  uspi and its affiliates have one surgery center and one private surgical hospital under construction and two additional surgery centers in the planning stage in the united states 
a typical surgery center costs from to million to develop  including construction  equipment and initial operating losses 
these costs vary depending on the range of specialties that will be undertaken at the facility 
our affiliates have budgeted an average of million for development costs for each of the three surgery center projects and approximately million for the surgical hospital project 
for the surgical facilities where construction has begun  equity contributions have been made  including those required of uspi  and external financing has been put in place at the unconsolidated affiliate and no additional financing needs are anticipated 
development costs are typically funded with approximately debt at the entity level with the remainder provided as equity from the owners of the entity 
in addition to the current development projects in the united states  our parkside hospital in london is developing a cancer treatment center that is expected to become operational during the second quarter of the remaining costs of this project are estimated to be approximately million  which we anticipate funding with borrowings under our credit facilities and cash flows from operations 
our acquisition and development program will require substantial capital resources  which we estimate to range from million to million per year over the next three years  including an estimated million related to additional consideration to the sellers of acquired facilities based upon those facilities achieving certain financial targets 
in addition  the operations of our existing surgical facilities will require ongoing capital expenditures 
we believe that existing funds  cash flows from operations and borrowings under our credit facilities will provide sufficient liquidity for the next twelve months 
thereafter  it is likely that we will require additional debt or equity financing for our acquisitions and development projects 
there are no assurances that needed capital will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain funds when needed or on acceptable terms  we will be required to curtail our acquisition and development program 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this standard requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under previous accounting standards  a liability for an exit cost as defined by the standard was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  to the extent that we initiate exit or disposal activities after this date  sfas no 
might have a material effect on our results of operations or financial position 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness to others fin 
fin addresses financial accounting for and disclosure of guarantees  requiring certain guarantees issued or modified after december  to be recorded at fair value 
this treatment differs from the existing treatment  under sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  of recording a liability only when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable 
we adopted the disclosure requirements  which apply to existing guarantees as well as newly issued ones  as of december  the portion of the standard requiring certain guarantees to be recorded at fair value was adopted january   and is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
this new standard amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide for alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  the standard amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements 
certain of the disclosure modifications are required for fiscal years ending after december  and were adopted by us as of december  in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin 
fin addresses the consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities  as defined in the interpretation  and is applicable for years ending after june  to interests in variable interest entities created or obtained after january  we do not expect the application of this standard to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have exposure to interest rate risk related to our financing  investing and cash management activities 
historically  we have not held or issued derivative financial instruments other than the use of variable to fixed interest rate swaps for portions of our borrowings under credit facilities with commercial lenders as required by the credit agreements 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
our financing arrangements with commercial lenders are based on a spread over libor or euribor 
at december   million of our total outstanding debt was the senior subordinated notes  which were issued in december at a discount and bear interest at a fixed rate of  million was in other fixed rate instruments and the remaining million was in variable rate instruments 
accordingly  a hypothetical basis point increase in market interest rates would result in additional annual interest expense of million 
the senior subordinated notes  which represent of our total fixed rate debt at december  are considered to have a fair value  based upon recent trading  of million  which is approximately million higher than the carrying value at december  our international revenues are a growing portion of our total revenues 
we are exposed to risks associated with operating internationally  including foreign currency exchange risk  and taxes and regulatory changes 
our international operations operate in a natural hedge to a large extent because all operating expenses and revenues are denominated in local currency 
additionally  our borrowings in the united kingdom are currently denominated in local currency 
historically  the cash flow generated from our operations in spain and the united kingdom have been utilized within each of those countries to finance development and acquisition activity as well as for repayment of debt denominated in local currency 
accordingly  we have not utilized financial instruments to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk 
inflation and changing prices have not significantly affected our operating results or the markets in which we perform services
