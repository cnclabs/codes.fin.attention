item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we develop  manufacture and distribute server appliance solutions that enable network equipment providers and independent software vendors  or isvs  to deliver data storage and security networking applications to their customers 
server appliances are pre configured network infrastructure devices designed to deliver specific application functionality 
the server appliance is sold and supported either by the network equipment or isv partner or alternatively by us through our distribution operation 
we also distribute third party data storage networking connectivity products to our customer base of over value added resellers  or vars  and systems integrators 
on december   we acquired tidalwire inc  a value added distributor specializing in the distribution of data storage networking connectivity products  primarily fibre channel host bus adapters  or hbas 
in addition to the revenue associated with our tidalwire distribution business  the acquisition provided us with a sophisticated logistics system  relationships with over vars and systems integrators and expanded post sales support capabilities 
the acquisition of tidalwire enables us to offer these distribution capabilities to current and future isv partners and thereby gives us the ability to expand our server appliance business 
at the time of our initial public offering in july  we were developing custom server hardware platforms for internet based organizations  content infrastructure providers and larger enterprises 
in response to competitive pressures and a significant downturn in the economy that negatively affected our customers  we implemented two restructurings of our operations during fiscal in the april restructuring  we sought to better align our operating expenses with reduced revenues 
in the july restructuring  we refocused our sales strategy toward strategic partnerships with network equipment providers and isvs and discontinued much of the customized hardware and software that was previously included in our server appliance solutions 
today  we combine our hardware packaging  system design and software integration expertise with our manufacturing  distribution  logistics and post sales support capabilities to provide a complete solution for our application provider customers 
we are currently organized into two reportable segments oem appliance and distribution 
oem appliance operations our oem appliance operation leverages our server appliance development  manufacturing and logistics services 
we produce and fulfill devices branded for our network equipment and isv partners  and we derive our revenues from the sale of the value added hardware platform to these partners 
these partners subsequently sell and support the device under their own brands to their customer base 
distribution operations revenues from our distribution operations are derived from two activities  first is the revenue derived from the distribution of third party products and components  primarily related to data storage area networking  second is the distribution of server appliances that we develop  manufacture  sell and support on behalf of our isv partners 

table of contents complementary product and component distribution revenues 
substantially all of our distribution operations revenue is currently derived from the distribution of third party data storage components and products  predominantly emc approved fibre channel hbas 
we are one of two authorized distributors in north america for fibre channel hbas that have been tested and approved by emc 
we are also a distributor of standard fibre channel hbas  network switches and other storage area networking products 
server appliance distribution revenues 
we have recently begun to recognize revenue derived from the sale and support of server appliances we have developed and manufactured in conjunction with our isv partners 
in this case  we are acting as a highly value added distributor for the isv  distributing the isv s software in the form of a co branded appliance  and acting as the point of sale and support for the device 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition and provisions for sales returns  product warranty obligations  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets  acquisition accounting  restructuring and other charges  stock compensation expense  and income tax asset valuation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we generally recognize revenue from sales of our products upon shipment to customers provided persuasive evidence of the arrangement has been received  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 
at the time of a sale transaction  we make an assessment of the collectibility of the amount due from the customer 
revenue is only recognized at that time if we are reasonably assured that collection will occur 
in making this assessment  management considers customer creditworthiness and historical payment experience 
when we enter into revenue arrangements containing multiple elements  the sale of both the product and post sales support  we allocate the total revenue to be earned under the arrangement among the various elements based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for each element and revenue is recognized when the revenue recognition criteria for each element is met 
if we are not able to derive vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for each 
table of contents component  revenues are deferred and recognized ratably over the period of the support arrangement  which is typically one year 
for post sales support services  revenue is recognized ratably over the period the services are performed 
historically  our oem appliance customers have not been granted rights to return our products after the purchase has been made 
however  in certain circumstances  we have accepted returns of oem appliance products  although we were not contractually obligated to do so 
our distribution customers are offered a thirty day right of return 
we record a provision for potential returns based on our historical return rates 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management makes judgments or uses estimates that prove to be materially different from actual experiences 
we include shipping and handling costs that are reimbursed by our customers  if any  as revenues and cost of revenues 
product warranty obligations we offer a warranty on all of our products that generally provide for us to repair or replace any defective products for a period of up to months after shipment 
based upon historical experience and expectation of future conditions  we reserve for the estimated costs to fulfill customer warranty obligations upon the recognition of the related revenue 
significant judgment and estimates are involved in estimating our warranty reserve 
to the extent we may experience increased warranty claim activity  increased costs associated with servicing those claims  or use estimates that prove to be materially different from actual claims  our warranty reserve may need to be increased  resulting in decreased gross profits 
allowance for doubtful accounts we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and each customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon historical experience and any specifically identified customer collection issues 
in addition  when evaluating the overall adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  we also consider customer concentrations and current economic trends 
while actual bad debts recorded against the allowance for doubtful accounts have historically been within expectations and the allowance established  we cannot be sure that we will continue to be able to estimate our future experience with the same success 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories we value our inventory at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a reserve for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and anticipated production requirements in the near future 
any rapid technological changes and future product development could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
agreements with certain suppliers to our distribution business include stock rotation provisions  however  these provisions may not provide us with complete protection from loss due to excess or obsolete inventory 
if our estimates of future product demand prove to be inaccurate  additional reserves may be required for incremental excess and obsolete inventory 

table of contents goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets goodwill and intangible assets are a result of our acquisition of tidalwire 
goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually 
intangible assets and goodwill are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
any impairment loss will be charged to operations in the period of the loss 
we assess the recoverability of long lived assets  including intangible assets  based on the projected undiscounted future cash flows over the asset s remaining life 
the amount of impairment  if any  is measured based on the excess of the carrying value over fair value  determined using projected discounted future operating cash flows 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
for goodwill recovery  we compare the carrying value of the segment to which the goodwill is allocated with the segment s fair value 
if the carrying value of the segment exceeds its fair value  then the carrying value of that segment s goodwill is compared to the implied fair value of the goodwill and an impairment loss is recorded in an amount equal to that excess  if any 
determining the fair value of individual assets and goodwill may include significant judgments by management 
different assumptions could yield materially different results 
acquisition accounting in december  we acquired tidalwire for total consideration of million  which was allocated to net tangible assets and liabilities acquired of million  deferred stock compensation of  customer relationships of million and goodwill of million 
the fair value of the customer relationships was determined based on the discounted estimated future cash flows from these relationships 
we have estimated that the useful life of these customer relationships would be five years 
significant judgments and estimates are involved in determining the fair value of assets acquired and their useful lives 
different assumptions could yield materially different results 
restructuring and other charges involuntary termination benefits and exit costs are recognized when management approves and commits to a sufficiently detailed plan of termination or exit plan 
management must assess whether costs incurred in connection with involuntary terminations and exit activities meet certain specific requirements to be recorded and classified as restructuring and other costs 
during compilation of a plan of termination or exit plan  we make certain assumptions and estimates regarding certain costs contained in these plans based on information gathered from internal and external sources 
in addition  charges taken for vacant facilities are recognized when the available information indicates that a loss is probable and estimable 
if actual results related to any of these assumptions or estimates were to exceed or not meet our expectations in the future  we may need to adjust certain restructuring and other charges in future reporting periods  resulting in increased or decreased operating expenses 
stock compensation in connection with the grant of certain options and restricted stock awards to employees issued prior to our initial public offering in july  we recorded deferred stock compensation within stockholders equity of million  representing the difference between the estimated fair value of the common stock for accounting purposes and the option exercise price of these options or restricted 
table of contents stock awards at the date of grant 
such amount is presented as a reduction of stockholders equity and is being amortized over the vesting period of the applicable options 
significant judgments and estimates were involved in determining the proper valuation of deferred stock compensation because at the time of grant there was no available market for our common stock 
different assumptions could have yielded materially different results 
income tax asset valuation we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the net tax effects of tax credits  operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
we then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimate of future taxable income and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
through september   we believe that it is more likely than not that all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  and  accordingly  we have recorded a valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets 
if results of operations in the future indicate that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be recovered  the reduction of the valuation allowance will be recorded as a tax benefit during one period or over several periods 
recent events on december   we amended our agreement with emc regarding the distribution of emc approved fibre channel hbas  effective january  this amendment extends the term of the agreement through december and provides for increased costs to us relating to sales of emc approved hbas 
tidalwire  our distribution operation  has been an authorized distributor of emc approved hbas since in fiscal  sales of emc approved hbas represented of our total net revenues and of our distribution revenues 
because of the amendment  there will be a decline in our gross profits related to sales of emc approved hbas  which will in turn have a negative impact on our distribution gross profits 
this decline in distribution gross profits is expected to have a negative impact on our consolidated gross profits and operating margins beginning in the quarter ending march  we expect that our gross profit from sales of emc approved hbas will be more consistent with the gross profit from our sales of other third party storage networking products  which has historically been between and of the net revenues from these sales 
this decrease in our distribution gross profit will begin in the quarter ending march  we are conducting a detailed evaluation of the impact of this amendment on our distribution segment to determine if the goodwill and intangible assets associated with our acquisition of tidalwire have been impaired 
as of september   the current book value of these assets was approximately million 
any impairment charge will be recorded in the three months ending december  a purported class action lawsuit was filed on december  in the united states district court in the district of massachusetts against us  john h 
curtis  our president and ceo  douglas g 
bryant  our cfo  vice president  treasurer and secretary  and lawrence a 
genovesi  our chairman of the board  relating to the timing of the announcement of the amendment of our agreement with emc regarding the resale of emc approved hbas 
the plaintiffs in the complaint claim that we and 
table of contents messrs 
curtis  bryant and genovesi allegedly failed to disclose that we were in the process of renegotiating our distribution contract with emc while issuing positive statements highlighting our financial performance and related matters 
the plaintiffs are seeking unspecified damages 
we believe that the action is without merit  and we intend to vigorously defend against the suit 
results of operations the following data summarizes the results of our operations for the past three fiscal years  in thousands and as a percentage of net revenues 
fiscal year ended september  amount of net revenues amount of net revenues amount of net revenues net revenues gross profit loss operating expenses loss from operations net loss net revenues and gross profit the following table summarizes our net revenues and gross profit by reportable segment  in thousands and as a percentage of net revenues fiscal year ended september  amount of net revenues amount of net revenues amount of net revenues oem appliance net revenues gross profit loss distribution net revenues gross profit total net revenues total gross profit loss revenues prior to our acquisition of tidalwire on december   our revenues were derived from sales of server appliance hardware platforms and related pre sales integration and supply chain management services in the united states 
in april  our largest oem appliance customer  emc  announced the availability of a product that incorporates one of our customized platforms 
since then  sales of that product have been a major portion of our net revenues 
as a result of our acquisition of tidalwire  we also distribute data storage networking connectivity products  consisting primarily of emc approved fibre channel hbas  through a channel of vars and systems integrators 
we intend to increase the number of data storage networking and network security products that we distribute  including server appliances developed with our network equipment and isv partners 

table of contents the increase in net revenues from fiscal to fiscal is due primarily to the addition of distribution sales as a result of our acquisition of tidalwire in december and due to increased oem appliance sales volumes to emc 
prior to the tidalwire acquisition  there were no distribution revenues 
sales to emc represented of our total net revenues and of our oem appliance revenues in fiscal the increase in net revenues from fiscal to fiscal is due to higher oem appliance sales volumes as a result of sales to emc  for which there was no comparable customer in fiscal sales to this customer represented of our total net revenues in fiscal the increase in net revenues in fiscal was partially offset by a decrease in the average selling price of our server appliance products due to our high concentration of net revenues as well as the absence of license revenues relating to our historical business during the year ended september  in fiscal  of our net revenues were generated from license arrangements  however  we did not have any license revenues subsequent to fiscal and do not anticipate any further license revenues 
we expect revenues to increase in fiscal due primarily to increased appliance sales to our largest customer 
in addition  we believe that sales to new oem appliance partners and sales of our isv partners server appliances will contribute to the expected increase in our net revenues in fiscal gross profit loss gross profit loss represents net revenues recognized less the cost of revenues 
cost of revenues includes cost of materials  manufacturing costs  warranty costs  inventory obsolescence charges and shipping and handling costs 
in addition  for internally manufactured server appliance products  cost of revenues includes compensation and related expenses for our manufacturing personnel 
the increase in gross profit in fiscal versus fiscal was primarily due to incremental revenues from our recently acquired distribution business  tidalwire  and increased oem appliance sales volumes 
to a lesser extent  the increase in gross profit in fiscal was due to lower manufacturing costs per unit sold 
the increase in gross profit in fiscal was offset in part by significantly increased warranty costs associated with oem appliance revenues  resulting primarily from higher estimated costs to fulfill warranties and the increased sales volumes of server appliances 
the increase in gross profit in fiscal versus was due primarily to an inventory write down of approximately million in fiscal for which there was no corresponding charge in fiscal the inventory write down resulted from an unanticipated decline in sales in fiscal  as well as a high level of inventory and firm inventory commitments compared to our reduced expectations for future product sales at that time 
in addition to the inventory write down in fiscal  the increase in gross profit in fiscal versus fiscal was also due to an increase in product sales volume  lower per unit materials costs and lower manufacturing costs 
a decrease in license revenues in fiscal partially offset the increase in gross profit 
our gross profit is affected by the product mix within our oem appliance business  our oem appliance product pricing as well as the timing  size and configuration of server appliance orders 
oem appliance gross profit is also affected by the mix of product manufactured internally compared to product manufactured by our contract manufacturer  which carries higher manufacturing costs 
our gross profit is also affected by the relative size of distribution revenues to oem appliance revenues as 
table of contents well as the mix of products sold through our distribution business as each of these products carries a different gross profit as a percentage of revenues 
we expect gross profit to continue to be affected by these factors as well as competitive pricing pressure in both the oem appliance and distribution segments and increased costs associated with our recently amended distribution agreement with emc 
as a result  we expect gross profit to increase in absolute dollars due to increased sales volumes and we expect gross profit as a percentage of net revenues to decrease during fiscal operating expenses the following table presents operating expenses during the periods indicated  in thousands and as a percentage of net revenues fiscal year ended september  amount of net revenues amount of net revenues amount of net revenues operating expenses research and development selling and marketing general and administrative stock compensation restructuring and other charges amortization of intangible assets total operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel engaged in research and development  fees paid to consultants and outside service providers  material costs for prototype and test units and other expenses related to the design  development  testing and enhancements of our server appliance products 
we expense all of our research and development costs as they are incurred 
research and development expenses decreased in fiscal versus fiscal due primarily to decreased compensation costs  which decreased as a result of our closure of our austin  texas software development center in december and our june headcount reduction 
these headcount reductions were a result of our transition away from the use of significant proprietary technology in our server appliance products 
we have significantly increased the use of standard off the shelf technology in our server appliance products  which has decreased our need for engineering personnel in our product design process 
prior to these headcount reductions  we had people in our engineering group 
at september   there were employees in our engineering group 
in addition  lower facility related expenses contributed to the decrease in research and development expenses in fiscal the decrease in research and development in fiscal was partially offset by increased prototype and consulting costs incurred in development projects for our oem appliance business 
research and development expenses decreased from fiscal to fiscal due primarily to decreased compensation and recruiting costs as the number of employees in our research and development group  which was as high as employees prior to our april and july restructurings  decreased to employees at september  this decrease in research and 
table of contents development expenses was also due to decreases in consulting  prototype and test unit costs as we increased the use of standard off the shelf components in our products  which reduced our need to build prototype and test units and allowed us to utilize fewer consultants in our product development process 
we believe that a significant level of investment in product development is required to remain competitive and we expect to continue to devote substantial resources to product development 
our engineering process includes the utilization of standard  off the shelf components in our server appliance hardware platforms wherever possible 
however  significant internal development efforts are required to fulfill our customers server appliance needs 
as a result  we expect research and development expenses to increase in fiscal  depending on actual server appliance development project activity 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related expenses for personnel engaged in sales  marketing  business development and customer support functions  as well as costs associated with travel and marketing programs 
the increase in selling and marketing expenses in fiscal versus fiscal was due to increased compensation costs as sales  marketing  business development and customer support personnel increased from employees at september  to employees at september   which was primarily due to our acquisition of tidalwire in december selling and marketing expenses decreased in fiscal versus fiscal due primarily to decreased compensation and recruiting costs as the number of employees in our sales  marketing and customer support group  which was as high as employees prior to the april and july restructurings  decreased to employees at september  the decrease in selling and marketing expenses in fiscal was also due to a significant reduction in spending on marketing programs  as we did not exhibit at any trade show or incur advertising expenses in fiscal to a lesser extent  decreased travel costs also contributed to the decrease in selling and marketing expenses during fiscal as a result of the decrease in sales  marketing and customer support personnel 
we expect selling and marketing expenses to increase in absolute dollars in fiscal as we continue to expand our sales and marketing efforts to further increase our market presence and grow our revenues 
however  we expect selling and marketing expenses to decrease as a percentage of net revenues in fiscal  depending on revenue growth 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for executive  finance  accounting  information technology  facilities and human resources personnel  as well as accounting  legal  audit and tax fees  insurance  administrative expenses associated with operating as a public company and bad debt expenses 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal versus fiscal is primarily attributable to increased compensation costs as general and administrative personnel increased from at september  to at september   primarily due to our tidalwire acquisition 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal is also due to increased legal  audit and tax and insurance expenses due to the rising costs associated with our operation as a public company 
table of contents and our defense of a lawsuit related to our acquisition of tidalwire 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded a reserve against certain receivables from our sub tenant due to the financial condition of this sub tenant  which contributed to the increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal was offset in part by our reversal of reserves against shareholder notes receivable in the first quarter of fiscal and a charge due to our settlement of a lawsuit brought against us by a former employee in the second quarter of fiscal the decrease in general and administrative expenses in fiscal versus fiscal is primarily due to lower bad debt expenses in fiscal in fiscal  we recognized a significant bad debt expense as a result of the economic down turn during that time period  which had an adverse effect on our customers 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses in fiscal is also attributable to lower compensation and recruiting costs as the number of employees in our general and administrative group  which was as high as employees prior to the april and july restructurings  decreased to employees as of september  in addition  the decrease in general and administrative expenses in fiscal was also due to lower consulting and professional service fees and was partially offset by a charge due to our settlement of a lawsuit brought against us on by a former employee 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars in fiscal and we expect general and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of revenues in fiscal depending on revenue growth 
stock compensation 
we recorded deferred stock compensation on our balance sheet of million in connection with stock option and restricted stock grants to our employees and directors that were granted between february  and june  this amount represents the difference between the exercise price and the deemed fair value of our common stock for financial reporting purposes at the date of grant 
we are amortizing this stock compensation over the vesting period of the related options 
all options granted subsequent to june  have been issued with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of our common stock and  accordingly  no additional deferred compensation has been recorded 
through september   we amortized million to stock compensation expense and million of deferred stock compensation has been reversed due to the cancellation of options for terminated employees 
in november  we recorded million of deferred compensation on our balance sheet as a result of restricted stock issued to the former employees of ip performance  inc  which was acquired by us in november in december  we terminated the employment of all of the former ip performance employees 
in accordance with the restricted stock agreements  all of the remaining unvested restricted stock vested upon termination 
as a result  we recognized the remaining deferred stock compensation of approximately million in december in connection with our acquisition of tidalwire  we assumed all of tidalwire s outstanding options  which converted into options to purchase  shares of our common stock 
we recorded approximately  of deferred stock compensation on our balance sheet related to unvested options 
this amount represents the difference between the exercise prices and the fair market value of our common stock on the option conversion date 
we are amortizing this deferred stock compensation 
table of contents over the remaining vesting period of the related options 
through september   we amortized  to stock compensation expense and  of deferred stock compensation has been reversed due to the cancellation of options for terminated employees 
the decrease in stock compensation expense in fiscal versus fiscal is due to the accelerated amortization of million of deferred stock compensation recorded in december as a result of our closure of our austin  texas development center and the termination of employee stockholders as a result of that facility closure 
the decrease in stock compensation expense in fiscal versus fiscal was due primarily to the reversal of deferred stock compensation associated with cancelled employee stock options in connection with headcount reduction undertaken in the fourth quarter of fiscal this decrease in stock compensation expense was offset by the charge taken in connection with our austin  texas development center closure in december we expect stock compensation amortization of approximately  in fiscal and approximately  in fiscal the amount of stock compensation expense to be recorded in future periods could change if restricted stock or options for accrued but unvested compensation are forfeited or if additional deferred stock compensation is recorded in future periods 
restructuring and other charges 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we recorded a charge to operations of  this charge was comprised entirely of future lease and lease related payments and resulted from the continued vacancy of certain leased facilities and the expected future vacancy of certain leased facilities that were occupied by a sub tenant 
this change in estimated sub lease income resulted in a charge of  and was determined through an analysis of the real estate market in and around these facilities  the likelihood that these facilities could be sub leased during the remainder of the existing lease terms and the financial condition of the sub tenant 
in the second quarter of fiscal  we received unanticipated sub lease income of approximately  from our existing sub tenant 
as a result  we recorded a  reversal of the associated restructuring accrual as a decrease to restructuring and other charges 
in october  we amended the lease agreement on our facilities  extending the term of our primary office and manufacturing space and eliminating the remaining lease term on space occupied by a sub tenant  as of october  this lease amendment required us to pay a termination fee of  in addition  we revised our estimates as to the expected future occupancy by us of previously vacant leased space 
the lease amendment  and our revised estimate as to the future occupancy of previously vacant leased space  resulted in a reversal of approximately  of restructuring accrual in the fourth quarter of fiscal we believe this lease amendment will result in a reduction to operating expenses of approximately  in fiscal and approximately  in fiscal in june  in an effort to further streamline operations  we implemented an additional restructuring whereby we reduced our workforce by employees  which impacted employees in all of our departments 
the implementation of this reduction in workforce resulted in a charge of  to operations  which was comprised entirely of employee related charges  including severance payments to terminated employees 
we believe this restructuring resulted in cost savings of approximately million in fiscal 
table of contents during fiscal  we undertook two restructurings of our operations  the first of these restructurings occurred in april and the second in july in the april restructuring  we sought to better align our operating expenses with reduced revenues  and as a result of the implementation  we recorded a charge to operations of million 
this charge was due to a reduction in workforce from employees to employees  the curtailment of a planned expansion into leased facilities and other items 
this charge included approximately million for employee related costs including severance payments to terminated employees and stock option compensation expense related to modifications of certain stock options held by terminated employees  approximately million to write off certain assets related to facilities that we would not be occupying and approximately  primarily related to non refundable deposits on tradeshows we did not attend as well as costs for certain other non cancelable sales and marketing commitments 
the july restructuring was the result of an intensive review of our business  which resulted in a refocus of the sales strategy toward strategic partnerships with network equipment providers and isvs and a discontinuation of much of the customized hardware and software that was previously included in our products 
as a result of the implementation of the july restructuring  we recorded a charge to operations of approximately million 
this charge included approximately million of employee related costs as we reduced our workforce by employees  approximately million as a result of our disposal of certain property and equipment  approximately million to write off goodwill and intangible assets which were deemed to be impaired  approximately  of facility costs associated with non cancelable operating leases for space which would not be occupied and approximately  of other charges 
in addition to the april and july restructurings  in march we recorded a charge due to the retirement of fixed assets related to our webengine blazer product line 
these fixed assets had a total net book value of approximately million and consisted primarily of computer equipment previously utilized in the production and sales of the webengine blazer  one of our previous generation web content server appliance products 
the total of the restructuring and other charges detailed above was approximately million recorded for the year ended september  the reduction in our workforce implemented during the year ended september  impacted employees in all of our groups  including manufacturing  research and development  selling and marketing and general and administrative 
we realized approximately million in cost savings in fiscal as a result of our fiscal restructurings 
amortization of intangible assets and goodwill 
in connection with our acquisition of tidalwire in december  we engaged an independent valuation firm to evaluate the intangible assets generated as a result of the acquisition 
as a result of this valuation work  we recorded approximately million of intangible assets attributable to tidalwire s existing customer relationships as of december  we estimated the useful life of the relationships to be five years and as such  we are amortizing the related intangible assets on a straight line basis over five years 
as noted under recent events above  we amended our agreement with emc regarding our distribution of emc approved fibre channel hbas 
as a result of this amendment  our gross profits from sales of emc approved hbas will decrease beginning in the three months ending march  we are evaluating the impact that this decrease in gross profits will have on our distribution segment and the fair value of the goodwill and intangible assets recorded as a result of our acquisition of tidalwire 
this evaluation may result in an impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and a charge to operations in the three months ending december  
table of contents in connection with our acquisition of ip performance in november  we recorded goodwill and intangible assets of million  of which we amortized  in the year ended september  during the year ended september   we completed an intensive review of our business  which resulted in the implementation of a restructuring plan 
as a result of this restructuring and an assessment of expected future cash flows  we determined that the recoverability of intangible assets resulting from our purchase of ip performance  inc was unlikely 
accordingly  we recognized an impairment charge in the july restructuring for the full amount of the remaining unamortized intangible assets  approximately million  during the year ended september  unless we determine that our intangible assets have been impaired as a result of the recent events noted above  we expect quarterly amortization of intangible assets of approximately  through december  however  in the event that our intangible assets have been impaired  our quarterly amortization of intangible assets could be materially different 
interest and other income expense  net interest and other income expense  net has decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and to  in fiscal these decreases were due to lower average interest rates earned on our cash equivalents and lower average cash  cash equivalents and short term investments balances as a result of the utilization of cash and cash equivalents to fund our net operating losses incurred since our initial public offering in july and to fund our acquisition of tidalwire in december liquidity and capital resources cash used in operating activities has declined from million in fiscal  to million in fiscal and to million in fiscal our declining use of cash for operations is a result of the restructuring activities undertaken in fiscal and the revenue and gross profit growth experienced as a result of our acquisition of tidalwire and the increased revenue from our oem appliance business 
our fiscal restructuring activities allowed us to lower our operating cash usage by first better aligning our operating expenditures with lower fiscal and fiscal revenues and second by implementing a change in business strategy 
our current oem appliance business strategy requires fewer employees and has allowed us to grow our server appliance sales to million in fiscal  greater than the million of revenues recorded in fiscal  prior to the downturn in the economy 
in addition  the acquisition of tidalwire further enhanced our value proposition and provided us with an additional million of revenues and million in gross profit in fiscal and has helped us reach profitability in our third and fourth fiscal quarters of  which  has allowed us to continually decrease the amount of cash used in our operations 
cash used in operations in each of the past three fiscal years was primarily the result of net losses of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal in addition  cash used in operations is also due to net working capital investments  which provided cash of million in fiscal due to a sharp decline in accounts receivable and inventories as a result of lower fiscal revenues 
in fiscal and  our net working capital investment was a use of cash of million and million  respectively  due primarily to the growth of inventory and accounts receivable  which was offset in part  in fiscal by the growth of accounts payable 

table of contents non cash adjustments to reconcile net loss to net cash used in operations were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal non cash charges include depreciation  amortization  provision for doubtful accounts  non cash restructuring charges and stock compensation expense 
we will continue to make what we believe to be necessary working capital investments to continue to grow our business and we expect to continue to use cash in our operating activities in fiscal in fiscal and we made significant investments in property and equipment as we grew our business 
these investments totaled approximately million  or of total fiscal and net revenues  and included improvements to our headquarters in canton  massachusetts  including our production facility  and investments in production equipment 
we have been able to leverage these earlier capital investments as we have grown our restructured server appliance business and  as a result  our investments in property and equipment have declined as a percentage of net revenues to  or of net revenues in fiscal  and  or of net revenues in fiscal in fiscal  we used approximately million of cash  including transaction costs  in connection with our acquisition of tidalwire in december because tidalwire  now part of our distribution segment  utilizes the warehousing and fulfillment services of a third party  our distribution business does not require a significant capital investment at this time 
we expect to invest in property and equipment in fiscal as we continue to grow our business 
however  depending on revenue growth in fiscal  we expect our fiscal property and equipment purchases to be relatively consistent to fiscal as a percentage of net revenues 
in addition to investments in property and equipment and our acquisition of tidalwire  cash used in our investing activities included our purchase of million of short term investments 
we purchased these short term investments due to declining interest rates on our available cash and cash equivalents 
however  as interest rates continued to decline in fiscal  the additional interest earned on our short term investments was not enough for us to continue with these short term investments and we sold them in fiscal with a gain  due to the continued low level of interest rates  and our conservative investment strategy of capital preservation  we do not anticipate investments in long term investments in fiscal at this time 
in fiscal  we guaranteed a bank loan to our chairman that was collateralized by his holdings in our common stock thereby restricting approximately million of our cash 
this guarantee was settled in fiscal through the combination of a cash repayment to us from the bank of  and the automatic conversion of the remaining guarantee of  into a note receivable to us from our chairman 
as a result of company policy  as well as the sarbanes oxley act of  we will not provide guarantees in any form to officers or directors in the future 
in addition  current company policy prohibits officers from collateralizing personal debt with company stock 
our financing activities since inception have been primarily from the sale of equity securities 
financing activities have been our principal source of cash since fiscal and  prior to our initial public offering in fiscal  we raised approximately million  net of offering costs  from the issuance of preferred stock 
in july of  we completed our initial public offering by selling a total of  shares of common stock at per share and raised approximately million  net of offering costs and underwriting fees totaling approximately million 
upon the completion of our initial public offering all shares of preferred stock were converted into common stock 
in addition to equity financing  we have generated cash as a result of employee stock option and stock purchase plan 
table of contents activity of  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal we expect employee stock option and stock purchase plan activity to continue in fiscal  however we cannot predict its level given the volatility of capital markets 
in addition  the primary financing activity that we have engaged in that has been a use of cash was our million common stock repurchase program 
this program was approved by our board of directors in august our stock repurchase program authorized us to repurchase our common stock from time to time on the open market or in non solicited privately negotiated transactions 
through the end of this program in november  we repurchased approximately  shares of our common stock at an average price of per share for a total of approximately million of cash 
in addition  from august through january  we repurchased  shares of our common stock at an average price of per share in exchange for the retirement of approximately million of debt  including accrued interest  from certain current and former employees and officers and our chairman 
in addition  we received cash repayments from our chairman of  related to a note receivable resulting from his purchase of restricted stock in and  of notes receivable resulting from the conversion of our guarantee of a bank loan to him 
since the adoption of the sarbanes oxley act of  we have not made any loans to any officers or directors 
all of our stock repurchases were recorded on our balance sheet as treasury stock at our cost to repurchase the stock 
we used  shares of our treasury stock  which had an average cost of per share  to help fund our acquisition of tidalwire in december as a result of the restructurings that we implemented in our fiscal  and  we are obligated to make additional cash payments of approximately  over the next twelve months and  thereafter for lease and facility related payments 
we anticipate that funds required to make all restructuring payments will be available from our current working capital 
in october  we amended our operating lease on our headquarters 
the following table sets forth future payments that we were obligated to make under our amended lease commitments in thousands fiscal year ending september  contractual obligation total operating leases as noted under recent events above  we amended our agreement with emc regarding our distribution of emc approved fibre channel hbas 
as a result of this amendment  our gross profits from sales of emc approved hbas will decrease beginning in the three months ending march  any reduction in our gross profits will have a negative impact on our future liquidity and capital requirements 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the timing and size of orders from our largest customer  our ability to form an adequate number of strategic partnerships with isvs  resellers  integrators and suppliers  
table of contents our ability to distribute server appliances for software companies through our newly acquired distribution business  our ability to maintain and increase the revenues and gross margins from our newly acquired distribution business  the level of success of our isv partners in creating demand for their products in the form of an appliance  the level of success of our strategic oem appliance partners in selling server appliance solutions that include our server appliance hardware platforms  the costs and timing of product engineering efforts and the success of these efforts  and market developments 
we believe that our available cash resources  including cash and cash equivalents  and cash that we expect to generate from sales of our products will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements through at least the next twelve months 
after that  we may need to raise additional funds 
we may in the future seek to raise additional funds through borrowings  public or private equity financings or from other sources 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available at all or  if available  will be on terms acceptable to us 
if additional financing is needed and is not available on acceptable terms  we may need to reduce our operating expenses 
related party transactions in january  we deposited million of cash with a bank to guarantee a personal loan of lawrence a 
genovesi  our current chairman and former president  chief executive office and chief technology officer 
this guarantee was made in order to avoid significant sales of our stock by mr 
genovesi as a result of a margin call on a personal loan collateralized by mr 
genovesi s holdings of our stock 
in conjunction with our guarantee of this loan  we entered into an agreement whereby mr 
genovesi agreed to reimburse us for any obligations incurred by us under the guarantee 
on january   the bank applied  of our funds that were on deposit with the bank in satisfaction of all amounts due to the bank from mr 
genovesi and refunded  to us 
on january   mr 
genovesi repaid us  to satisfy his obligations to us in full under the reimbursement agreement 
of that amount   was paid in cash and  was paid with the proceeds from the repurchase by us of  shares of our common stock owned by mr 
genovesi in a private transaction 
during fiscal year  we repurchased  shares of common stock held by mr 
genovesi at a cost of  of the purchase price   was applied against mr 
genovesi s outstanding loans due to us  while the remaining  was paid in cash to mr 
genovesi 
mr 
genovesi also repaid  due to us under his remaining outstanding loans 
on january   mr 
genovesi  repaid to us a recourse note payable of  with proceeds from our repurchase of  shares of our common stock owned by mr 
genovesi 

table of contents in april  we entered into five recourse loans with certain of our officers and employees at that time totaling approximately  we entered into these loan agreements to avoid substantial sales of our common stock by these individuals as a result of their alternative minimum tax obligations incurred as a result of their exercise of common stock options 
the loans had an interest rate of per year and were due  as amended  in september these officers and employees pledged to us all shares of our common stock owned by them  all common stock options held by them and all proceeds received by them on the sale of either our common stock or common stock options 
during fiscal year  we received proceeds from loans principal and interest payments of approximately  we repurchased  shares of common stock as repayment for principal and interest for an additional  in january  the remaining loans of approximately  were repaid in full  including accrued interest  through our repurchase of  shares of our common stock 
in connection with our acquisition of tidalwire  we paid  in cash to ascent venture partners and  in cash to harbourvest partners  two of our substantial stockholders 
at the time of the acquisition  ascent and harbourvest owned approximately and of our outstanding common stock  respectively 
ascent and harbourvest also owned and of the outstanding common stock of tidalwire  respectively 
pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement  we issued  shares and  shares of our common stock previously held as treasury stock to ascent and harbourvest  respectively  and made the aforementioned cash payments to ascent and harbourvest in exchange for all of the tidalwire common stock held by ascent and harbourvest 
in connection with the tidalwire acquisition  we engaged akibia  inc to provide certain warranty fulfillment services 
akibia charges us a fee for these services based upon sales of certain of our products 
a director of ours is also a director of psi holding group  inc the parent company of akibia 
at the time this relationship was established  ascent and harbourvest each owned greater than of our outstanding stock and greater than of the outstanding stock of psi 
in the twelve months ended september   we recognized  of expense as a result of our agreements with akibia 
in addition  tidalwire had certain agreements with akibia related to administrative and accounting services and leased certain facilities from akibia 
these agreements terminated in march payments related to these agreements by us during fiscal totaled  at september   we had amounts due to akibia of  recent accounting pronouncements in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
  and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
fin 
fin elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
fin does not prescribe a specific approach for subsequently measuring the guarantor s recognized liability over the term of the related guarantee 
it also incorporates  without change  the guidance in fasb interpretation no 
 disclosure of indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which is being superseded 
the disclosure provisions of fin are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods that end after december 
table of contents and the provisions for initial recognition and measurement are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees that are issued or modified after december   irrespective of a guarantor s year end 
the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in november  the emerging issues task force of the fasb reached a consensus on issue  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
eitf requires that for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  those deliverables be divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables meet certain criteria as defined by eitf arrangement consideration is to be allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values and revenue recognition decisions should be considered separately for each separate unit of accounting 
eitf is effective for all arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june   with early adoption permitted 
the adoption of eitf did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas 
sfas establishes standards for how an issuer of equity classifies and measures on its balance sheet certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  and for existing financial instruments after october  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have an impact on our financial position or our results of operation 
factors that may affect future operating results the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we are faced with 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us  or that are currently deemed immaterial  may also impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
risks of dependence on one strategic partner 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues from emc and our revenues may decline significantly if this customer cancels or delays purchases of our products  terminates its relationship with us  or exercises certain of its contractual rights 
in the years ended september  and  sales directly to emc  our largest customer  accounted for and of our total net revenues and and of our oem appliance revenues  respectively 
primarily all of these sales are attributable to one oem appliance product pursuant to a non exclusive contract 
we anticipate that our future operating results will continue to depend heavily on sales to  and our relationship with  this customer 
accordingly  the success of our business will depend  in large part  on this customer s willingness to continue to utilize our server appliance solutions in its existing and future products 
further  our financial success is dependent upon the continued success of the product we currently sell to this customer and the continued growth  viability and financial stability of this customer  whose industry has experienced rapid technological 
table of contents change  short product life cycles  consolidation and pricing and margin pressures 
a significant reduction in sales to this customer  or significant pricing and margin pressures exerted on us by this customer  would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  if this customer delays or cancels purchases of our products  our operating results would be harmed and our ability to accurately predict revenues  profitability and cash flows would decrease 
under the terms of our non exclusive contract with our largest customer  this customer the right to enter into agreements with third parties for similar products  our largest customer is not obligated to purchase any minimum quantity of products from us and may choose to stop purchasing from us at any time  with or without cause 
in addition  this customer may terminate the agreement in the event that we attempt to assign our rights under the agreement to another party without this customer s prior approval 
furthermore  in the event that we default on certain portions of the agreement  this customer has the right to manufacture certain products in exchange for a mutually agreeable royalty fee 
if any of these events were to occur  or if this customer were to delay or discontinue purchases of our products  as a result of dissatisfaction or otherwise  our revenues and operating results would be materially adversely affected and our reputation in the industry might suffer and our ability to accurately predict revenues  profitability and cash flows would decrease 
a significant portion of our current distribution revenues are attributed to sales of emc approved fibre channel hbas 
the december amendment of our agreement with emc regarding the sale of such hbas will result in lower gross profits on such sales  which may cause our business to suffer 
in addition  our business would also suffer if we were no longer authorized to distribute emc approved hbas  if additional distributors were authorized to distribute such hbas or if the gross profits we derive from these sales were further reduced 
in the year ended september   approximately of our distribution revenues  or of our total net revenues  were derived from sales of fibre channel hbas approved for configuration in certain emc data storage networking products 
we are one of two north american distributors that emc has authorized to distribute emc approved fibre channel hbas 
sales of these hbas have historically had a higher gross profit however  as a result of an amendment to our agreement with emc regarding our sales of these hbas  the costs to us to sell such hbas will increase in the three months ending march  as a result of this increase in our costs  gross profits on our sales of emc approved hbas will decline beginning in the three months ended march  we expect that our gross profit from sales of emc approved hbas will be more consistent with our sales of other third party storage networking products  which have historically been between and of the net revenues from these sales 
this decline in our distribution gross profit will begin in the quarter ending march  this decline will negatively impact our distribution segment business operations and could cause our other business operations to suffer 
for instance  higher costs to us on sales of emc approved hbas may not allow us to reduce prices to the level of our competitors  which could cause us to lose customers who purchase emc approved hbas from us as well as other products 
the loss of customers of our distribution segment could cause our distribution segment s revenues to decline and could limit our ability to distribute server appliances  which would severely damage our business 
in addition  emc is not contractually prohibited from increasing or decreasing the number of authorized north american distributors of these hbas 
if emc were unwilling to permit us to resell such hbas  or if it were to expand its relationships with other distributors  our relationships with 
table of contents vars and systems integrators of data storage network components could be materially adversely affected and our reputation would suffer 
in addition  if we were no longer permitted to resell emc approved hbas  we could lose customers of our distribution segment  which could cause our distribution segment s revenues to decline and could limit our ability to distribute server appliances  which would severely damage our business 
risks related to business strategy 
our future success is dependent on our ability to generate significant revenues from relationships with network equipment providers and isvs 
a major component of our business strategy is to focus our selling and marketing efforts on indirect sales through relationships with network equipment providers and isvs 
to date  we have not entered into a significant number of definitive agreements with network equipment providers or isvs 
even if we are successful in developing relationships with a significant number of network equipment providers and isvs  we will be reliant on our partners ability to create demand for their server appliance products 
if we engage network equipment or isv partners whose products are technologically inferior to competitive products or who do not commit an adequate level of resources to promoting their server appliance products  sales of these server appliance solutions may be limited and our revenues and operating results may suffer 
in addition  our business strategy requires us to expend a significant level of engineering  selling and marketing resources for each of our network equipment or isv partners 
if we fail to generate enough revenues to offset the financial demands that our strategy places on our business  our future operating results will suffer 
if we are unsuccessful in our efforts to sell our server appliance solutions by leveraging our tidalwire distribution operation  our revenues and operating results may suffer 
one of the reasons that we acquired tidalwire was to utilize tidalwire s distribution channel to sell the server appliance solutions developed for our current and future server appliance distribution isv partners 
however  we have limited experience in selling and marketing server appliances through this newly acquired distribution channel 
to successfully sell such server appliance solutions through our distribution operation we must work extensively with these isv partners selling and marketing personnel and our var and systems integrator partners 
we may find that the amount of time and resources that are required to effectively sell our partners server appliance solutions through our distribution operation is more significant and costly than was originally planned 
if we are unable to generate sufficient revenues by leveraging our distribution operation to increase sales of our server appliance solutions in a cost effective and timely manner  our operating results may suffer and we may determine that we need to discontinue this component of our business strategy 
if we fail to expand our network of resellers  or fail to add server appliances to our distribution product line or expand into the network security market  our revenues and operating results may be adversely affected 
a key component of our business strategy is to broaden our distribution business by  among other things  expanding our network of vars and systems integrators  selling a portion of our server appliance solutions to our network of vars and systems integrators and focusing our sales and marketing efforts in both the data storage and network security markets 
if we fail to increase the 
table of contents number of resellers  retain and expand relationships with existing resellers  or fail to add additional products to our distribution product line  our revenues and operating results may be adversely affected 
in addition  in order to expand our business into the network security market  we may need to expend substantial resources and it may take us longer to establish strategic partnerships due to our lack of experience in this market 
if we are not successful in expanding in this market  our revenue growth may be limited and our operating results may be adversely affected 
our business could be harmed if we fail to adequately integrate technologies or the operations of the businesses that we may acquire in the future 
as part of our strategy  from time to time we expect to review opportunities to invest in complementary businesses  products or technologies that would expand the breadth of our markets or enhance our technical capabilities  or that may otherwise offer growth opportunities 
we have made in the past  and may make in the future  acquisitions of or significant investments in businesses  products or technologies 
any future acquisitions present numerous risks  including difficulties in integrating the operations  technologies  products and personnel of the acquired companies and realizing upon the anticipated synergies of the combined businesses  managing the risks of entering markets or types of businesses in which we have limited or no direct experience  unanticipated problems or latent liabilities  such as problems with the quality of the installed base of the target company s products  and diversion of management s attention from the core operations of the business 
if we acquire a new business  we may be required to expend significant funds  incur debt  issue additional securities or assume liabilities  any of which may negatively affect our operations and be dilutive to our stockholders 
in addition  such acquisitions could result in one time charges related to acquisition costs  severance costs  employee retention costs and in process research and development 
the failure to adequately address these risks could harm our business and financial results 
risks related to financial results 
we have a history of losses and may continue to experience losses in the future  which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
since our inception  we have incurred significant net losses and  although we were profitable in the three and six months ended september   we could incur net losses in the future 
we believe that any future growth will require us to incur significant engineering  selling and marketing and administrative expenses 
as a result  we will need to generate significant revenues to sustain profitability 
in addition  lower gross profit from our sales of emc approved hbas beginning in the quarter ending march   as a result of our recently amended distribution agreement with emc  will negatively impact our profitability 
as a result of these factors  we cannot be certain that we will be able to sustain profitability in the future 
if we do not maintain profitability  the market price for our common stock may decline 

table of contents our quarterly revenues and operating results may fluctuate seasonally  which could result in decreased revenue from quarter to quarter  which in turn could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
seasonal fluctuations in revenue and operating results in the data storage networking industry are common 
in particular  this industry typically experiences increased orders and resulting revenues in the quarter ended december  and a subsequent decline in orders and resulting revenues during the quarter ended march with a substantial amount of our revenue derived from data storage networking products  we may experience significant quarter to quarter fluctuations in revenues and operating results due to customers timing their orders based on their own quarterly financial considerations 
accordingly  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
nonetheless  the market price of our common stock could decline in response to these variations 
our quarterly revenues and operating results may also fluctuate for reasons other than seasonality  which could cause our operating results to fall below expectations and thus impact the market price of our common stock 
in addition to seasonality issues  our quarterly revenues and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
none of our customers are obligated to purchase any quantity of our products in the future nor are they obligated to meet forecasts of their product needs 
our operating expense levels are based in part on expectations of future revenues and gross profits 
if revenues or gross profits in a particular quarter do not meet expectations  operating results could suffer and the market price of our common stock could decline 
factors affecting quarterly operating results include the timing and size of orders from customers  particularly our largest customer  the loss of key suppliers or customers  the mix of oem appliance revenues and distribution revenues and the product mix within each  the ability to expand our production capacity  the mix of product manufactured internally and by our contract manufacturer  the availability of products from suppliers  price competition  changing global economic conditions  and the timing of expenditures in anticipation of increased revenues 
in addition  as a result of our amended agreement with emc regarding our sales of emc approved hbas  our costs incurred in connection with sales of such hbas will increase beginning in the three months ending march  as a result  our gross profits on such sales will begin to decrease in the three months ending march  this will increase the difficulty in predicting our quarterly revenues and gross profits  which could have a negative impact on our business 

table of contents if the products and services that we sell become more commoditized and competition in the server appliance  data storage and network security markets continues to increase  then our gross profit as a percentage of net revenues may decrease and our operating results may suffer 
products and services in the server appliance  data storage networking and network security markets may be subject to further commoditization as these industries continue to mature and other businesses introduce additional competing products and services 
the gross profit as a percentage of revenues of our products may not grow to our targeted gross profit percentages or may even decrease  in response to changes in our product mix  competitive pricing pressures  or new product introductions into the server appliance and data storage markets 
if we are unable to offset decreases in our gross profits as a percentage of revenues by increasing our sales volumes  operating results will decline 
changes in the mix of sales of our products  including the mix of higher margin sales of products sold in smaller quantities and somewhat lower margin sales of products sold in larger quantities  could adversely affect our operating results for future quarters 
to maintain our gross profits  we also must continue to reduce the manufacturing cost of our server appliance products 
our efforts to produce higher margin server appliance products  continue to improve our server appliance products and produce new server appliance products may make it difficult to reduce our manufacturing cost per product 
further  utilization of a contract manufacturer may not allow us to reduce our cost per product 
if we fail to respond adequately to pricing pressures  to competitive products with improved performance or to developments with respect to the other factors on which we compete  we could lose customers or orders 
if we are unable to compete effectively  our business and prospects could be seriously harmed 
risks related to the server appliance  data storage and network security markets 
if server appliances are not increasingly adopted as a solution to meet companies networking application needs  the market for our server appliance solutions may not grow  which could negatively impact our revenues 
we expect that a substantial portion of our revenues will come from sales of server appliance solutions and customized integration services and  eventually  the sale of server appliance solutions through our distribution operations 
as a result  we are substantially dependent on the growing use of server appliances to meet businesses storage and security networking application needs 
the market for server appliance products has only recently begun to develop and we believe it is evolving rapidly 
because this market is relatively new  we cannot predict its potential size or future growth rate with a high degree of certainty 
our revenues may not grow and the market price of our common stock could decline if the server appliance market does not grow as rapidly as we expect 
our expectations for the growth of the server appliance market may not be fulfilled if customers continue to use general purpose servers 
the role of our products could  for example  be limited if general purpose servers become better at performing functions currently being performed by server appliances or are offered at a lower cost 
this could force us to further lower the prices of our products or result in fewer sales of our products  which would negatively impact our revenues or force us to lower the prices of our server appliance solutions  which would decrease our gross profits 

table of contents the products that we sell are subject to rapid technological change and our sales will suffer if these products are rendered obsolete by new technologies 
the markets we serve are characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions and enhancements  potentially short product life cycles  changes in customer demands and evolving industry standards 
in the server appliance market  we attempt to mitigate these risks by utilizing standards based hardware platforms and by maintaining an adequate knowledge base of available technologies 
however  the server appliance products that we sell could be rendered obsolete if products based on new technologies are introduced or new industry standards emerge and we are not able to incorporate these technological changes into our products 
likewise  if data storage vendors develop products that incorporate the functionality of the fibre channel hbas that we distribute  the marketability of the fibre channel hbas that we distribute will suffer and our distribution sales will be materially adversely affected 
further  we do not have extensive experience in the network security market and if we are unable to provide the appropriate products for the network security market  our anticipated distribution sales will suffer 
to remain competitive in the server appliance market  we must successfully identify new product opportunities and develop and bring new products to market in a timely and cost effective manner 
to maintain the competitiveness of our distribution business  we must continue to provide products and services that our customers require and continue to identify new products and services that meet the changing needs of our current and prospective customers 
our failure to keep pace with rapid industry  technological or market changes could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
the cyclical nature of the data storage industry could hurt our operating results 
the data storage industry has historically been characterized by fluctuations in product demand and supply  and  consequently  severe fluctuations in price 
in recent years  this industry has experienced a significant downturn in demand resulting in excess production levels  and we are uncertain as to the severity and duration of future demand downturns  if any 
although our distribution agreements with some manufacturers provide us with limited price protection and limited rights of return  any shortfalls in demand and excess production could hurt our distribution sales and gross profits 
if any such shortfalls in demand or such excess production were to continue for a prolonged period of time  our results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
in addition  many of our var and system integrator customers in the data storage industry are subject to the risks of significant shifts in demand and severe price pressures by their customers  which may increase the risk that we may not be able to collect accounts receivable owed by some of our customers 
if we are unable to collect accounts receivable  our results of operations and financial condition may suffer 
we cannot assure you of the timing  duration or magnitude of any recovery in the markets in which we operate  or that such markets will not experience renewed  and possibly more severe and prolonged downturns in the future  or that our operating results or financial condition will not be adversely affected by them 
conversely  if the data storage industry experiences significant unit volume growth that  in turn  results in increased demand for any of the products we distribute  we may experience a shortage of our products 
in such event  our operating results could depend on the amount of product allocated to us by manufacturers and the timely receipt of such product 

table of contents risks related to competition 
competition in our markets is intense and if we fail to compete effectively our financial results will suffer 
in the server appliance market  we face significant competition from a number of different types of companies 
our competitors include companies who market general purpose servers  specific purpose servers and server appliances as well as companies that sell custom integration services utilizing hardware produced by other companies 
many of these companies are larger than we are and have greater financial resources and name recognition than we do  as well as significant distribution capabilities and larger  more established service organizations to support their products 
our large competitors may be able to leverage their existing resources  including their extensive distribution capabilities and their service organizations  to provide a wider offering of products and services and higher levels of support on a more cost effective basis than we can 
we expect competition in the appliance market to increase significantly as more companies enter the market and as our existing competitors continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products and technologies 
such increased competition could adversely affect sales of our current and future products and services 
in addition  competing companies may be able to undertake more extensive promotional activities  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and offer more attractive terms to their customers than we can 
if our competitors provide lower cost products with greater functionality or support than our server appliance solutions  or if some of their products are comparable to ours and are offered as part of a range of products that is broader than ours  our server appliance solutions could become undesirable 
even if the functionality of competing products is equivalent to ours  we face a risk that a significant number of customers would elect to pay a premium for similar functionality rather than purchase products from a less established vendor 
we attempt to differentiate ourselves from our competition by offering a wide variety of software integration  branding  supply chain management  engineering  support  distribution  logistics and fulfillment services 
if we are unable to effectively differentiate our products and services from those of our competition  our revenues will not increase and may decline 
furthermore  increased competition could negatively affect our business and future operating results by leading to price reductions  higher selling expenses and a reduction in our market share 
likewise  the data storage and network security industries are highly competitive 
as a result of our acquisition of tidalwire  we now compete against a variety of companies  such as other commercial distributors of data storage products 
as we enter the network security market  the number of companies that we compete with will further increase 
some of our current and future competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  marketing  distribution and other resources than we do and may be able to respond more quickly than us to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  which could reduce our market share 
these competitors may also establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with our key customers and other parties with whom we have strategic relationships  which could harm our ability to distribute our current and future products 
our revenues could be negatively affected if our larger competitors consolidate their extensive distribution capabilities with our smaller competitors products 
large server manufacturers may not only develop their own server appliance solutions  but they may also acquire or establish cooperative relationships with our smaller competitors  developing server 
table of contents appliance products and related technologies 
because large server manufacturers have significant financial and organizational resources available  they may be able to quickly penetrate the server appliance market by leveraging the technology and expertise of smaller companies with their own extensive distribution channels 
we expect that the server industry will experience further consolidation 
it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share through consolidation 
consolidation within the server marketplace could adversely affect our revenues 
risks related to marketing and sales efforts 
we need to effectively manage our sales and marketing operations to increase market awareness and sales of our products and services and to promote our brand recognition 
if we fail to do so  our growth will be limited 
although we have a relatively small sales and marketing organization  we must continue to increase market awareness and sales of our products and services and promote our brand in the marketplace 
in the rapidly evolving market for server appliance solutions  we believe that to compete successfully we will need network equipment providers and isvs to recognize network engines as a top tier provider of server appliance platforms  custom integration services and server appliance distribution services 
in the market for data storage and network security products  we will need vars and systems integrators to recognize tidalwire as a leading value added distributor of these products 
if we are unable to design and implement effective marketing campaigns or otherwise fail to promote and maintain the network engines and tidalwire brands  we may not increase or maintain sales and our business may be adversely affected 
our business would also suffer if we incur excessive expenses promoting and maintaining these brands but fail to achieve the expected or desired increase in revenues 
if we are unable to effectively manage our customer service and support activities  we may not be able to retain our existing customers and attract new customers 
we need to effectively manage our customer support operations to ensure that we maintain good relationships with our customers 
we outsource certain of our customer support activities to a third party and  therefore  we depend on this third party to successfully address our customers needs 
if this customer support organization is unsuccessful in maintaining good customer relationships  we may lose customers to our competitors and our reputation in the market could be damaged 
as a result  we may lose revenue and incur losses greater than expected 
risks related to product manufacturing 
our dependence on sole source and limited source suppliers for key components makes us susceptible to supply shortages and potential quality issues that could prevent us from shipping customer orders on time  if at all  and could result in lost sales and customers 
we depend upon single source and limited source suppliers for our industry standard processors  main logic boards  certain disk drives  hardware platforms and power supplies as well as our cooling systems  chassis and sheet metal parts 
we also depend on limited sources to supply several other industry standard components 
we have in the past experienced  and may in the future experience  
table of contents shortages of or difficulties in acquiring components in the quantities and of the quality needed to produce our products 
shortages in supply of these key components for an extended time would cause delays in the production of our products  prevent us from satisfying our contractual obligations and meeting customer expectations  and result in lost sales and customers 
if we are unable to buy components in the quantities and of the quality that we need on a timely basis or at acceptable prices  we will not be able to manufacture and deliver our products on a timely or cost effective basis to our customers  and our competitive position  reputation  business  financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed 
if our server appliance solutions fail to perform properly and conform to specifications  our customers may demand refunds  assert claims for damages or terminate existing relationships with us and our reputation and operating results may materially suffer 
because our server appliance hardware platforms are complex  they could contain errors that can be detected at any point in a product s life cycle 
in addition  because our solutions are combined with products from other vendors  should problems occur  it might be difficult to identify the source of the problem 
in the past  we have discovered errors in some of our server appliance solutions and have experienced delays in the shipment of our server appliance products during the period required to correct these errors or we have had to replace defective products that were already shipped 
for example  in our last fiscal year  we incurred substantially higher than anticipated warranty charges as the result of defects discovered in one of the third party components previously used in some of our server appliance solutions 
errors in our server appliance solutions may be found in the future and any of these errors could be significant 
significant errors  including those discussed above  may result in the loss of or delay in market acceptance and sales of our server appliance products  diversion of engineering resources  the loss of new or existing server appliance partners  injury to our reputation and other customer relations problems  and increased maintenance and warranty costs 
any of these problems could harm our business and future operating results 
product errors or delays could be material  including any product errors or delays associated with the introduction of new products or versions of existing products 
if our server appliance solutions fail to conform to warranted specifications  customers could demand a refund for the purchase price and assert claims for damages 
moreover  because our server appliance solutions may be used in connection with critical computing systems services  we may receive significant liability claims if they do not work properly 
while our agreements with customers typically contain provisions intended to limit our exposure to liability claims  these limitations do not preclude all potential claims 
liability claims could exceed our insurance coverage and require us to spend significant time and money in litigation or to pay significant damages 
any claims for damages  even if unsuccessful  could seriously damage our reputation and business 

table of contents our future server appliance revenue growth is dependent on our ability to expand production capacity 
our existing manufacturing facility is limited in its production capacity 
for us to achieve significant server appliance revenue growth our server appliance sales volumes must increase significantly and our production capacity must increase to support such sales volumes 
to supplement our production capacity  we utilize the services of a contract manufacturer 
however  our contract manufacturer is not obligated to supply products to us for any specific period  or in any specific quantity  except as may be provided in a particular purchase order 
using a contract manufacturer increases our cost of producing products and could decrease our gross profits 
in the event that we need to change contract manufacturers or require significantly increased production levels  we could experience transitional difficulties  including production delays and quality control issues  that could prevent us from satisfying our production requirements on a timely basis  cause customer relationships to suffer and result in lost sales 
also  the use of a contract manufacturer does not guarantee us production levels  manufacturing line space or manufacturing prices  the lack of which could interrupt our business operations and have a negative effect on operating results 
if we do not accurately forecast our component and product requirements  our business and operating results could be adversely affected 
we use rolling forecasts based on anticipated product orders to determine our component requirements 
lead times for materials and components that we order vary significantly  among other things  on factors including specific supplier requirements  contract terms and current market demand for those components 
in addition  a variety of factors  including the timing of product releases  potential delays or cancellations of orders and the timing of large orders  make it difficult to predict product orders 
as a result  our component and product requirement forecasts may not be accurate 
if we overestimate our component and product requirements  we may have excess inventory  which would increase costs and negatively impact our cash position 
if we underestimate our component and product requirements  we may have inadequate inventory  which could interrupt our manufacturing and delay delivery of our products to customers resulting in a loss of sales or customers 
any of these occurrences would negatively impact our business and operating results 
our distribution business is dependent on certain suppliers and our business would suffer if we lost any significant suppliers or faced a product shortage 
our distribution business is highly dependent on suppliers for substantially all of the products that we sell 
a small number of data storage suppliers provide products that represent a significant majority of our storage distribution sales 
the loss of any significant supplier could harm our financial condition and results of operations 
our distribution agreements are cancelable on short notice 
our reliance on a small number of suppliers for our distribution business leaves us vulnerable to having an inadequate supply of required products  price increases  late deliveries and poor product quality 
from time to time  our distribution business  like other distributors in this industry  has experienced supply shortages and we have been unable to purchase our desired volume of products 
if we are unable to enter into and maintain satisfactory distribution arrangements with leading suppliers and an adequate supply of products  our revenues could suffer considerably 

table of contents risks related to product dependence on intellectual property 
our reliance upon contractual provisions  domestic patent  copyright and trademark laws and applied for patents to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient to protect our intellectual property 
certain of our server appliance solutions are differentiated from the products of our competitors by our internally developed software and hardware and the manner in which they are integrated into our server appliance solutions 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property  other vendors could sell products with features similar to ours  which could reduce demand for our solutions 
we believe that the steps we have taken to safeguard our intellectual property afford only limited protection 
others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology or design around the copyrights and trade secrets we own 
despite the precautions we have taken  laws and contractual restrictions may not be sufficient to prevent misappropriation of our technology or deter others from developing similar technologies 
in addition  there can be no guarantee that any of our patent applications will result in patents  or that any such patents would provide effective protection of our technology 
in addition  the laws of the countries in which we may decide to market our services and solutions may offer little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology 
reverse engineering  unauthorized copying or other misappropriation of our proprietary technology could enable third parties to benefit from our technology without paying us for it  which would significantly harm our business 
our operating results would suffer if we were subject to a protracted infringement claim or one that resulted in a significant damages award 
substantial litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the technology industry 
we expect that server appliance products may be subject to third party infringement claims as the number of competitors in the industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
from time to time we receive claims from third parties that our server appliance products have infringed their intellectual property rights 
although we do not believe that our server appliance products employ technology that infringes the proprietary rights of any third parties  third parties may make claims that  with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation  including potential liability for damages  divert our management s attention and resources  cause product shipment delays  and require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
royalty or licensing agreements may not be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
a successful claim of product infringement against us or the failure or inability to license the infringed or similar technology could adversely affect our business because we would not be able to sell the impacted product without redeveloping it or incurring significant additional expenses 

table of contents other risks related to our business 
if the site of our manufacturing operations  third party distribution center or third party post sales support provider were to experience a significant disruption in its operations  it would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of our operations 
our manufacturing facility and headquarters are concentrated in one location 
in addition  our third party distribution center in memphis  tennessee handles substantially all of the distribution of the products of our distribution business and our third party post sales support center in westborough  massachusetts handles substantially all of the post sales support obligations for our distribution business 
if the operations of any of these facilities were disrupted as a result of a natural disaster  fire  power or other utility outage  work stoppage or other similar event  our business could be seriously harmed as a result of interruptions or delays in our manufacturing or distribution operations 
class action lawsuits have been filed against us  our board of directors  our chairman and certain of our executive officers and other lawsuits may be instituted against us from time to time 
in december  a class action lawsuit relating to our initial public offering was filed against us  our chairman  one of our executive officers and the underwriters of our initial public offering 
in addition  in january  a purported class action lawsuit was filed against us and our board of directors relating to the acquisition of tidalwire inc more recently  on december   a purported class action lawsuit was filed against us and john h 
curtis  our president and ceo  douglas g 
bryant  our cfo  vice president of finance and administration  treasurer and secretary  and lawrence genovesi  our chairman of the board and former president relating to the timing of our announcement of the amendment of our hba distribution agreement with emc 
for more information on these lawsuits  see business legal proceedings 
in december  we settled the class action lawsuit filed against us relating to the acquisition of tidalwire inc and we are currently attempting to settle the lawsuit filed against us related to our initial public offering 
we are unable to predict the effects on our financial condition  or our business  of the lawsuit related to our initial public offering  the lawsuit related to our announcement of the amendment of our hba distribution agreement with emc or other lawsuits that may arise from time to time 
while we maintain certain insurance coverage  there can be no assurance that claims against us will not result in substantial monetary damages in excess of such insurance coverage 
in addition  we have and may in the future expend significant resources to defend such claims 
these class action lawsuits  or other similar lawsuits that may arise from time to time  could negatively impact both our financial condition and the market price of our common stock 
if we fail to retain and attract appropriate levels of qualified technical personnel  we may not be able to develop and introduce our products on a timely basis 
we require the services of qualified technical personnel 
in the past  we have experienced the negative effects of an economic slowdown  including significant declines in our revenues and a significant decrease in the market price of our common stock 
as a result  we have implemented various personnel reductions  which placed added pressure on our remaining employees 
these and other factors may make it difficult for us to retain and attract the qualified employees that we need to effectively manage our business operations  including key engineering activities 
if we are unable to 
table of contents retain and attract a sufficient number of technical personnel we may not be able to complete development of  or upgrade or enhance  our products in a timely manner  or successfully integrate our network equipment and isv partners software with our hardware platforms  any of which could negatively impact our business and could hinder any future growth 
if we do not retain our senior management  we may not be able to successfully execute our business strategy 
since our restructurings in fiscal and  and as a result of our acquisition of tidalwire  we have added key members to our current management team 
the loss of key members of our management team could harm us 
our success is substantially dependent on the ability  experience and performance of our senior management team 
because of their ability and experience  we may not be able to successfully execute our business strategy if we were to lose one or more of these individuals 
if we are unable to successfully execute our business strategy  our operating results would suffer 
the market price for our common stock may be particularly volatile  and our stockholders may be unable to resell their shares at a profit 
the market price of our common stock has been subject to significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate or decline 
during fiscal  the price of our common stock ranged from a low of to a high of 
the stock markets have experienced significant price and trading volume fluctuations 
the market for technology stocks has been extremely volatile and frequently reaches levels that bear no relationship to the past or present operating performance of those companies 
general economic conditions  such as recession or interest rate or currency rate fluctuations in the united states or abroad  could negatively affect the market price of our common stock 
in addition  our operating results may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
if this were to occur  the market price of our common stock would likely significantly decrease 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such companies 
such litigation could result in substantial cost and a diversion of management s attention and resources 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate in response to various factors  some of which are beyond our control 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the following changes in market valuations or earnings of our competitors or other technology companies  actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  changes in financial estimates or investment recommendations by securities analysts who follow our business  technological advances or introduction of new products by us or our competitors  the loss of key personnel  our sale of common stock or other securities in the future  significant sales of our common stock by existing stockholders  affiliates and insiders  intellectual property or litigation developments  
table of contents changes in business or regulatory conditions  the trading volume of our common stock  and disruptions in the geopolitical environment  including war in the middle east or elsewhere or acts of terrorism in the united states or elsewhere 
the decline in the market price of our common stock and market conditions generally could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital  to complete future acquisitions of or investments in other businesses and to attract and retain qualified technical and sales and marketing personnel 
we have anti takeover defenses that could delay or prevent an acquisition and could adversely affect the price of our common stock 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and  without any further vote or action on the part of the stockholders  will have the authority to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of the preferred stock 
this preferred stock  if issued  might have preference over the rights of the holders of common stock and could adversely affect the price of our common stock 
the issuance of this preferred stock may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
we currently have no plans to issue preferred stock 
in addition  provisions of our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation  second amended and restated by laws may deter an unsolicited offer to purchase us 
these provisions  coupled with the provisions of the delaware general corporation law  may delay or impede a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving us 
for example  our board of directors is divided into three classes  only one of which is elected at each annual meeting 
these factors may further delay or prevent a change of control of our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not engage in any foreign currency hedging transactions and therefore  do not believe we are subject to exchange rate risk 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
we invest excess cash balances in cash equivalents 
we believe that the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows will not be material
