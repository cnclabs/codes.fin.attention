the following should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview we derive our revenues primarily from providing investment management  distribution  and administrative services to the funds and institutional and separately managed accounts 
investment management fees  our most substantial source of revenues  are based on the amount of average assets under management and are affected by sales levels  financial market conditions  redemptions  and the composition of assets 
underwriting and distribution revenues  another substantial source of revenues  consist of sales charges and commissions derived from sales of investment and insurance products and distribution fees  as well as legend s advisory services 
the products sold have various sales charge structures and the revenues received from sales of products vary based on the type and amount sold 
rule b distribution fees earned for distributing certain mutual fund shares are based upon a percentage of assets and fluctuate based on sales  redemptions  and financial market conditions 
service fees include transfer agency fees  custodian fees for retirement plan accounts  and portfolio accounting fees 
mackenzie acquisition on december   we completed our acquisition of the business of mackenzie investment management inc mimi  a florida based us investment management subsidiary of toronto based mackenzie financial corporation mfc and adviser of the ivy funds sold in the united states 
the transaction was approved by the boards of directors of waddell reed financial  inc  mimi  and mfc in august of and by the shareholders of mimi and ivy fund in early december we continue to operate mimi s business through our subsidiary  waddell reed ivy investment company wriico 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase business combination and accordingly  the results of wriico s operations have been included with ours since the acquisition date 
in the days of our ownership during the fourth quarter of  wriico contributed million of revenue and million of pretax earnings 
based on the terms of the purchase agreement  we paid approximately million to purchase the business of mimi  plus approximately million for excess working capital 
of the total million purchase price  million was held in escrow at december   to be paid following final working capital adjustments 
on march   we paid million of the escrow balance 
the final purchase price is subject to working capital adjustments 
as part of the transaction  we have entered into new subadvisory and marketing agreements 
these agreements extend mfc s subadvisory agreements with wriico and provide us with additional investment management opportunities in canada 
pursuant to the subadvisory agreements  we will receive investment management fees covering multiple funds whose assets were approximately million usd at december  pursuant to the marketing agreement  mfc will provide us with opportunities to launch new funds and or assume additional existing subadvisory mandates under the universal brand name in canada  and will facilitate our relationship with mfc s parent company  investors group inc and its affiliates 
with respect to wriico s us business  we will maintain the ivy fund brand name  expand its product offerings and use it for us retail nonproprietary load fund distribution  while utilizing our investment management capabilities to strengthen the ivy fund product line 
select ivy funds are also available to waddell reed advisors  where a number of styles offered by wriico are not part of our current proprietary product line 
at december   the ivy funds had million in assets 
we have taken steps to bring waddell reed s investment management team to the ivy funds  and in march  we announced our future plans to merge the ivy fund and w r funds families under the ivy brand name  thus creating a combined product line of considerably greater scale and breadth  which will utilize w r funds historical performance for marketing purposes 
the performance of the ivy funds has been excluded from our other funds performance statistics throughout this annual report as the ivy funds were under our management for only days in  which in our opinion is too brief a time period to measure any performance statistics of these funds resulting from our management expertise 
with the merger of the ivy fund and w r funds families expected during  we do not expect the past performance of the ivy funds to be indicative of future results under waddell reed s management  which has historically been superior to that of the ivy funds 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements 
our consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a consistent basis 
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies 
we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates we use to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
we rely on historical experience  third party professionals  and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable to make judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies and estimates used by management in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements valuation of long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill  income taxes  pension and postretirement benefits  and litigation contingencies 
additionally  see note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a summary of significant accounting policies 
valuation of long lived assets we regularly review the carrying value of certain long lived assets with respect to any events or circumstances that indicate impairment or an adjustment to the amortization period is necessary 
if circumstances suggest the recorded amounts cannot be recovered  calculated based upon estimated future undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets  the carrying values of these assets are reduced to fair value 
accounting for intangible assets and goodwill as a result of the acquisition of mimi on december   we recorded million of indefinite lived intangible assets and an increase to goodwill of million 
two significant issues arise with respect to these assets that require management estimates and judgment i the valuation in connection with the initial purchase price allocation  and ii the ongoing evaluation of impairment 
in connection with all of our acquisitions  a valuation is completed to determine reasonable purchase price allocations 
specifically  upon completion of the allocation process in the case of our acquisition of mimi in  approximately of the excess of the purchase price over the tangible net assets was assigned to various identifiable intangible assets 
considering that identifiable intangible assets are contracts related to the management of mutual funds which will be continually offered and which are not expected to be terminated in the foreseeable future  such intangible assets were determined to be non amortizable under statement of financial accounting standards no 
business combinations sfas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
the purchase price allocation process requires management estimates and judgment as to expectations for the various products  distribution channels  and business strategies 
for example  certain growth rates and operating margins were assumed for different products and distribution channels 
if actual growth rates or operating margins  among other assumptions  differ from the estimates and judgments used in the purchase price allocation  the amounts recorded in the financial statements for identifiable intangible assets and goodwill could be subject to charges for impairment in the future 
in connection with the june issuance of sfas  we stopped amortizing goodwill effective january  in lieu of amortization  we performed the required transitional impairment test for goodwill recorded as of january  upon the completion of this test  we concluded that no impairment of goodwill existed at the date of adoption 
at least annually  or in the case of certain factors being present  we complete an ongoing review of the recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets using a fair value based approach 
the approach for the review of goodwill has two steps  the first being to identify a potential impairment and a second step to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually using a one step approach that compares the fair value to the carrying amount of the asset 
factors that are considered important in determining whether an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets might exist include significant continued underperformance compared to peers  significant changes in our business and products  material and ongoing negative industry or economic trends  or other factors specific to each asset or subsidiary being evaluated 
because of the significance of goodwill to our consolidated balance sheets  the annual impairment analysis is critical 
any changes in key assumptions about our business and our prospects  or changes in market conditions or other externalities  could result in an impairment charge and such a charge could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
see note goodwill and identifiable intangible assets of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
accounting for income taxes the provision for income taxes is based upon our estimate of taxable income for each respective accounting period 
we recognize an asset or liability for the deferred tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements  including the determination of any valuation allowances that might be required against deferred tax assets 
these temporary differences will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years when the reported amounts of assets are recovered or liabilities are settled 
we have not recorded a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets as of the current reporting period based on our belief that operating income will  more likely than not  be sufficient to realize the benefit of these assets over time 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or if our historical trend of positive operating income changes  we may be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
pensions and other postretirement benefits our pension and other postretirement benefits costs and liabilities are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies prescribed under statement of financial accounting standards no 
employers accounting for pensions sfas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
employers accounting for other postretirement benefits other than pensions sfas 
we use certain assumptions  including but not limited to  the selection of i the discount rate used to calculate the present value of plan liabilities  ii the expected return on plan assets  and iii the expected health care cost trend rate 
the discount rate assumption is based upon the review of high quality corporate bond rates and the change in these rates during the year 
the expected return on plan assets and health care cost trend rates are based upon an evaluation of our historical trends and experience  taking into account current and expected future market conditions 
in the event that actual results differ from estimates  future pension costs and funding requirements may change materially 
litigation contingencies as discussed in note contingencies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  there are legal proceedings pending in various jurisdictions against us  for which it is impossible to predict the outcome 
in one matter  an unfavorable decision awarding compensatory damages against us has been returned and is being appealed 
in another matter  an arbitration panel ordered us to pay punitive damages  which was subsequently vacated and remanded back to the arbitration panel for reconsideration 
it is possible that there could be further adverse developments in these cases 
except as otherwise disclosed  management believes that the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of these matters cannot be reasonably estimated and we have not provided any amounts in the consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes  if any  other than what has been described in note it is possible that our business  results of operations  cash flows  or financial position could be materially adversely affected by an unfavorable outcome of certain pending litigation 
we believe that we have valid bases for appeal of all adverse decisions 
all such cases are  and will continue to be  vigorously defended

the decline in the market  represented by the daily average close of the s p index in compared to  is the primary cause of the decrease in average assets under management

underwriting and distribution fee revenues underwriting and distribution fee revenues are derived primarily from sales commissions charged on front end load mutual funds  variable annuities  and other insurance products  and to a lesser extent from financial planning fees 
revenues are also derived from rule b asset based distribution fees earned on deferred load products  and asset based fees earned on the strategic portfolio allocation product spa and other variable annuity products 
over underwriting and distribution fee revenues decreased million  or  to million in sales volume of front end load products class a mutual fund shares  variable products  financial plans  and other front end load mutual funds generates front load commission revenue 
front load product revenues declined million  or  in as a result of a decline in related sales 
sales of variable products were down in due to the large volume of commissionable variable annuity exchanges that took place in included in variable product sales were million of commissionable variable annuity exchanges 
the increase in the commissionable variable annuity exchanges resulted from our clients exchanging their uilic policies into nationwide policies that offered more attractive features and service 
this activity is viewed as a one time occurrence resulting from the availability of a superior product 
sales of insurance products  specifically fixed annuities  term insurance  and medicare supplement insurance  were up substantially for  resulting in an increase in insurance revenues of million  or  reaching million for the year 
while our principal sales focus is on investment products  our financial planning process which incorporates the sale of insurance products continues to ensure that our financial advisors serve their clients needs regardless of economic conditions 
asset based fee revenues earned on deferred load products from class b and class c shares  declined  or million  primarily due to the decline in related assets under management 
this decline in assets was largely the result of stock market depreciation 
asset based fee revenues earned on our spa products introduced in the third quarter of contributed an increase of million to revenues 
over underwriting and distribution fee revenues increased million in legend  acquired on march   contributed million to the current year s underwriting and distribution fee revenues  an increase of million compared with certain investment product sales  namely class a share mutual funds and variable annuity products  both with front end load charges  generate commission revenues based on sales volume 
other front load product revenues are fees collected for financial plans and commissions collected from the sale of other mutual funds 
in  commission revenues from front load investment products were million  a decrease of million  or  from  while sales of these products increased 
the primary reason commission revenues decreased while front end load sales increased was the volume and product mix of variable product sales 
sales of variable products were billion in compared with billion in  an increase of 
included in variable product sales in is million of commissionable variable annuity exchanges 
front load revenues decreased while the related sales increased due to significantly lower commission rates on these commissionable variable annuity exchanges and a larger number of new sales in of variable products with a lower commission structure 
overall  commission rates on variable annuity products declined from in to in the increase in commissionable variable annuity exchanges resulted primarily from our clients exchanging their uilic policies into nationwide policies that offered more attractive features and service 
asset based fee revenues earned on deferred load products from class b and class c shares  declined  or million  primarily due to the decline in related assets under management 
this decline in assets was largely the result of stock market depreciation 
asset based fee revenues earned on our spa products introduced in the third quarter of contributed million to revenues 
additionally  greater insurance product sales during the current year generated an increase in distribution revenue of million 
shareholder service fee revenues shareholder service fee revenues primarily include transfer agency fees  custodian fees from retirement plan accounts  and portfolio accounting fees 
over shareholder service fee revenues increased million  or  to million for fee revenues earned from transfer agency services and custodial services composed of total shareholder service fee revenue in fee revenues earned from transfer agency services increased million  or 
although a portion of the increase in transfer agency service fees can be attributed to growth in the number of shareholder accounts  the primary reason for the increase in revenue was a per account service fee rate increase that commenced in december the impact of the per account service fee increase was approximately million for the average number of shareholder accounts increased to million excluding ivy fund accounts from million last year 
revenues earned from custodial services decreased million primarily due to a decline in custodial assets that generate fee revenues for legend 
over shareholder service fee revenues increased million  or  to million in due primarily to the increase in the average number of accounts serviced 
the average number of shareholder accounts increased to million in fee revenues earned from transfer agency services and custodial services composed of total shareholder service fee revenue in and increased million  or  and million  or  respectively 
underwriting and distribution expense underwriting and distribution expense includes costs associated with the marketing  promotion  and distribution of our products 
the primary costs are commissions and other compensation paid to financial advisors  sales force management and other marketing personnel  plus overhead expenses relating to field offices  sales programs  and marketing and advertising 
over underwriting and distribution expenses declined million  or  in to million 
in the third quarter of  we recorded a special charge of million pre tax  or million after tax  for the write off of stock loans 
this non cash charge relates to promissory notes that were extended to a select group of financial advisors and sales managers to facilitate their ownership of our stock at our ipo in march of and drive future advisor productivity and retention growth 
this charge resulted from financial advisors and sales managers having collectively met the productivity requirements of the stock loan program  such that the notes were expected to be forgiven 
excluding this charge  the decrease in expense was million  or virtually flat 
total direct expenses expenses relating to sales volume such as commissions  advisor incentive compensation  and commission overrides paid to field management decreased million  or 
direct expenses associated with the sale of front end load products declined million  or  in direct correlation with the decline in front end load commission revenues 
other than from front end load proprietary products  direct selling costs related to investment products ie deferred load mutual funds  spa asset allocation  insurance  direct selling costs of legend  and advisor incentive compensation increased million due chiefly to higher advisor payout expenses resulting from increased revenues due to spa asset growth and increased insurance product sales 
offsetting these increases in direct selling costs was million lower advisor incentive compensation for certain sales force incentive compensation is based on annual productivity and is accrued during the year based on estimated sales activity 
this incentive compensation was structured to exclude payment for commissionable variable annuity exchanges 
because of the volume of commissionable variable annuity exchanges in million  actual incentive compensation recognized in was only slightly lower than that of indirect expenses expenses that do not fluctuate directly with sales volume or sales revenues increased million  or  and composed of total underwriting and distribution expenses in compared with in in  we recorded a non cash charge of million to write off stock loans made to certain financial advisors and sales managers since the productivity requirements of the loan program were considered to have been collectively met such that the notes were expected to be forgiven 
in fact  these notes have been subsequently forgiven 
excluding this charge  indirect expenses increased million 
lower rule b expense reimbursements received from the funds due to lower average asset levels resulted in an increase in indirect expense of million 
some of the other more significant increases in indirect expenses for were for increases in technology related costs related to computer services  data transmission  and software maintenance and licensing of million  field office facilities costs of million  group health and accident insurance costs for the field of million  increases of million for legal costs allocated to underwriting and distribution based on their nature  and a million increase in indirect selling expenses at legend due to a change in office structure 
beginning in  management decided to open new legend offices structured similar to that of waddell reed advisors 
legend s typical office structure supports veteran retirement advisors whereby the expenses of operating the offices are borne by the advisors and managers and not by the company 
in turn  commission rates paid to these advisors are relatively higher 
six legend offices were opened in in which regional vice presidents were hired to recruit and manage relatively inexperienced advisors 
the commission rates paid to these advisors are lower and the office expenses are borne by the company 
while this caused an increase in indirect expenses and lower distribution margins in the short term  the benefits come from a faster growing sales force  broader market penetration and higher direct margins 
our distribution margin was for and for while prior to the acquisition of wriico  wholesale third party distribution efforts did not produce underwriting and distribution fee revenues  the collection of assets results in future investment management fee revenues 
underwriting and distribution costs related to third party distributors were million for each of the years and the waddell reed advisors distribution margin  which excludes third party distribution costs  wriico  and the special charge for stock loans and therefore  better reflects the activity of waddell reed advisors  declined from in to in  primarily due to lower sales volume 
over underwriting and distribution expenses  composed of direct and indirect costs  were million for  an increase of million  or  compared with in the third quarter of  we recorded a special charge of million pre tax  or million after tax  for the write off of stock loans 
this non cash charge relates to promissory notes that were extended to a select group of financial advisors and sales managers to facilitate their ownership of our stock at our ipo in march of and drive future advisor productivity and retention growth 
this charge resulted from financial advisors and sales managers having collectively met the productivity requirements of the stock loan program  such that the notes were expected to be forgiven 
in fact  these notes have been subsequently forgiven 
excluding this charge  the increase in expense was million  or 
total direct expenses expenses relating to sales volume such as commissions  advisor incentive compensation  and commission overrides paid to field management decreased million  or 
direct expenses associated with the sale of front end load products declined million  or  correlating with the decline in front end load commission revenues 
other than from front end load proprietary products  direct selling costs related to investment products ie  deferred load mutual funds  spa asset allocation  insurance  direct selling costs of legend  and advisor incentive compensation decreased million primarily due to a decrease in advisor incentive compensation 
certain sales force incentive compensation is based on annual productivity and is accrued during the year based on estimated sales activity 
the final productivity at the end of the year is used to determine the amount of incentive compensation paid to financial advisors 
the number of advisors earning incentive compensation in decreased substantially from this incentive compensation is also structured to discourage commissionable variable annuity exchanges 
the decrease in advisor incentive compensation was partially offset by increases in direct costs related to deferred load products and higher advisor payout expenses resulting from increased revenues due to spa asset growth and increased insurance product sales 
indirect expenses expenses that do not fluctuate directly with sales volume or sales revenues increased million  or  and comprised of underwriting and distribution expenses in compared with in some of the more significant increases in indirect expenses for were million for stock loans  million for facilities costs related to field offices  million for general and administrative costs associated with marketing our products  and million for field office sales administration support compensation 
legend  acquired on march   contributed an increase to indirect expenses in of million  reflecting a full year of contribution to our operations 
our distribution margin for was and in excluding the one time charge for stock loans  this margin was 
in  we incurred expenses of million for underwriting related to third party distributors 
while wholesale third party distribution efforts do not produce underwriting and distribution fee revenues  the collection of assets results in future investment management fee revenues 
the distribution margin excluding this expense and the special charge for stock loans was 
compensation and related costs compensation and related costs are expenses incurred to compensate our home office employees and the home office employees of legend and acf 
the primary expenses are base salaries and incentive compensation  but also include payroll taxes  group health and life insurance  and pension and k savings plan costs 
over compensation and related costs for increased million  or  to million 
average headcount and base salaries were relatively flat compared with group health and accident insurance costs and incentive bonus compensation increased million and million  respectively  over last year 
over compensation and related costs for were essentially flat at million  compared with million for over of compensation costs are base salaries and incentive compensation 
average headcount for increased  which contributed to the increase in base salaries of 
the increase in base salaries was offset with a somewhat larger decrease in incentive bonus compensation 
the other components of compensation  group insurance and savings plan costs  increased slightly due to the increase in headcount 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expenses are operating costs other than those related to compensation and to distribution efforts  including  but not limited to  computer services and software costs  telecommunications  facilities costs of our home offices  costs of professional services  and insurance 
we recover certain of our general and administrative costs related to underwriting and distribution through rule b service and or distribution fees  which are paid by the funds 
over general and administrative expenses increased million  or  for reaching million 
the majority of the increase resulted from increased legal costs of million 
also  in the third quarter of  we recorded a million pre tax special charge for the estimated cost of the payment of the compensatory damage and attorneys fees portion of the nasd arbitration award 
this charge was recorded when we made the strategic legal decision to no longer appeal the compensatory damage and attorneys fees portion of the award after it was reduced from million to million by the new york supreme court 
the inclusion of pre and post judgment interest on this amount increased the total charge to million 
the million compensatory damage and attorneys fees award was paid on february  please refer to item legal proceedings for additional information 
facilities costs increased million from last year million due to increased security costs over and the remainder attributable to increased space rent 
costs for various discretionary overhead items  such as business meeting and travel costs  temporary contracted business services  telecommunications  and postage and freight costs were reduced approximately million from over general and administrative expenses increased  or million  to for cost containment in certain discretionary overhead items was offset by an increase in legal costs and facilities costs 
on march   we completed the sale of our two home office buildings to an unrelated third party and entered into an agreement with them to lease the buildings back for a period of fifteen years  thereby resulting in additional expense of million during for rent 
investment and other income over investment and other income decreased million  or  to million for while average balances invested in commercial paper were relatively flat compared with  income earned on those investments decreased million due to lower average interest rates 
the average commercial paper rate declined from to in overall  average invested cash and marketable securities were million in compared with million in on july   we deposited million in cash with the circuit court of jefferson county  alabama  for an appeal bond related to the previously disclosed uilic case 
this deposit earned interest at per annum throughout the rest of during  we recorded million in interest income related to this deposit 
offsetting the appeal bond interest  we earned million less in dividends from our investments in affiliated mutual funds during over investment income declined million  or 
in  realized gains from the sale of investment securities were million less than in in  investment and other income included million of realized gains from the sale of investment securities sold to partially fund the legend acquisition 
less interest was earned on investments in the current year due to lower average interest rates 
the average investment in commercial paper was million in compared with million in the decreased average investment in commercial paper paired with lower short term interest rates yielded a million decline in income on these investments 
the average commercial paper rate declined from in to in overall  average invested cash and marketable securities were million in compared with million in depreciation over depreciation of property and equipment increased million  or  to million for increases in depreciation costs resulted from depreciable leasehold improvements made to our home office buildings and additions to capitalized computer software and internal software development costs 
over depreciation of property and equipment increased million  or  in to million 
with the construction of a second home office building placed into service in late  we purchased additional furniture and fixtures  which have relatively short useful lives  contributing an increase to depreciation expense of million in both home office buildings were sold in a sale leaseback arrangement on march  the additional furniture and fixtures purchased in more than offset the decrease in depreciation expense associated with the sale leaseback of the buildings 
other less significant sources of increase in depreciation expense were additions to capitalized software  leasehold improvements  and machinery and equipment 
interest expense over interest expense decreased million  or  to million for mainly due to interest savings related to an interest rate swap agreement we entered into in march of on march   our million fixed rate senior notes maturing in february the notes were effectively converted to variable rate debt by entering into an interest rate swap agreement whereby we have agreed with another party to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between the fixed rate and various floating rate interest amounts  calculated using a notional amount of million 
the difference in the floating rate interest paid and the fixed rate interest received is recorded as an adjustment to interest expense during the period that the related debt is outstanding 
at december   the floating rate being paid was 
the average floating rate paid on the interest rate swap for the year ended december  was 
additionally  interest expense declined due to lower average short term debt balances and borrowing rates in average short term borrowing rates fell from for to for over interest expense increased million  or  in the average balance on the combined short term and long term debt outstanding was million for and million for the average interest rate applied  excluding other costs  was for and for the total outstanding debt balance at december  was million  of which million was short term 
write down of investment securities our investments are comprised of us  state  and government obligations  corporate debt securities  and investments in affiliated mutual funds 
substantially all investments are classified as available for sale 
unrealized holding gains and losses on these securities  net of related tax effects  are excluded from earnings until realized and are reported as a separate component of comprehensive income 
all investments are reviewed by the company for declines in fair value 
if such declines are considered other than temporary  the cost basis of the individual security or mutual fund is written down to fair value as a new cost basis  and the amount of the write down is included in earnings 
during the third quarter of  we recorded a charge to earnings of million  pre tax  to reflect the other than temporary decline in value of certain holdings in affiliated mutual funds 
amortization of goodwill we stopped amortizing goodwill effective january   in connection with the adoption of sfas goodwill amortization was million for income taxes our effective income tax rate was   and  in  and  respectively 
the effective tax rate in was lower than the statutory rate due to state credits earned from past construction of one of our home office buildings and favorable resolution of previous years tax liabilities with tax authorities 
the rate was also affected by discontinuing the amortization of goodwill and the state of kansas passing new state income tax legislation favorable to the mutual fund industry

on february   the million punitive damage award was vacated and the matter was remanded back to the nasd arbitration panel by the appellate division of the new york supreme court 
net operating cash inflows for were million lower than this decrease can be primarily attributed to declines in net income as well as other changes in working capital

the increase in cash provided by real estate sales in the prior year was offset by additional purchase price payments for previous acquisitions of million made to previous owners of acquired businesses for attaining certain earnings levels during as specified in purchase agreements 
these specified earnings levels were not met during or and therefore  no additional purchase price cash payments were required

there are no balances outstanding under this line of credit at december  or at any time during management believes its available cash  marketable securities  and expected cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund dividends  operations  advance sales commissions  obligations  and other reasonably foreseeable cash needs 
we may also continue to repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time  as management deems appropriate 
the share repurchases could be financed by our available cash and investments and or the use of our revolving credit facility or utilization of the money market loan program

recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
business combinations sfas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas

sfas also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values and reviewed for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for impairment of long lived assets sfas 
we adopted the provisions of sfas upon its issuance and sfas effective january  as of january   we are no longer amortizing goodwill 
on the date we adopted sfas  we performed an evaluation of our goodwill that was acquired in prior business combinations to identify intangible assets that require recognition and reporting apart from that of goodwill and concluded that we have no separately identifiable intangible assets requiring recognition apart from goodwill 
also  on the date we adopted sfas  in accordance with that standard  we performed a goodwill impairment assessment and concluded that no impairment of goodwill existed at the date of adoption 
we had unamortized goodwill in the amount of million at december  as a result of the adoption of sfas  amortization expense related to goodwill was million lower for than that which would have been recognized under prior accounting rules

accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
sfas  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
we have adopted sfas as of january  we do not expect the implementation of this standard to have any impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
in august  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets sfas 
sfas addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the implementation of sfas did not have an impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections as of april sfas which is effective for fiscal years beginning after may  sfas rescinds sfas and sfas  which required all gains and losses from extinguishment of debt to be aggregated and  if material  classified as an extraordinary item  net of related income tax effect 
as a result  gains and losses from debt extinguishment are to be classified as extraordinary only if they meet the criteria in accounting principles board opinion reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
sfas also requires that sale leaseback accounting be used for transactions that are similar in form and substance to sale leaseback transactions 
we do not expect implementation of this statement to have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
sfas requires that a liability  measured initially at fair value  for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
a fundamental concept of sfas is that an entity s commitment to a plan  by itself  does not create a present obligation to others that meets the definition of a liability 
the provisions of sfas are effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  early application is encouraged and previously issued financial statements are not required to be restated 
we expect to adopt sfas for any such exit or disposal activities effective january  in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no

the transition provisions of sfas are effective for fiscal years ending after december   and the disclosure requirements are effective for interim periods beginning after december  we currently plan to continue to apply the intrinsic value based method to account for stock options and will comply with the new disclosure requirements 
seasonability and inflation we do not believe our operations are subject to significant seasonal fluctuations 
we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on operations 
risk factors we are at risk of litigation which could result in substantial costs to us and adversely impact our earnings 
we are in litigation with united investors life insurance company uilic  and other related parties over terms of a compensation agreement we entered into in july pursuant to the agreement  uilic was to pay us compensation at varying rates on variable annuities underwritten by uilic and distributed by us 
in may  uilic challenged the validity and duration of that agreement and subsequently asserted various contractual and tort damage claims against us regarding our replacement of uilic variable policies with nationwide variable policies 
in august  a nasd dispute resolution arbitration panel entered an award of million against waddell reed  inc the award arose from a complaint by a former financial advisor of the company 
the panel directed payment of approximately million in compensatory damages  plus attorneys fees of  it also ordered the payment of punitive damages in the amount of million 
on february   the appellate division of the new york supreme court vacated the panel s punitive damage award of million and remanded the matter back to the panel for reconsideration of the issue of punitive damages 
the court upheld the lower court s previous rulings on compensatory damages and attorneys fees 
we satisfied the outstanding judgment on these awards on february  on march   the former financial advisor petitioned the panel for reconsideration of the issue of punitive damages as allowed by the order of the appellate division of the new york supreme court and requested a pre hearing conference with the panel as soon as possible 
on march   the former financial advisor filed a motion for permission to appeal the appellate division s february  order to the new york court of appeals 
these  and other  litigation matters could result in substantial costs to the company and divert resources and management s attention from operations 
such costs and diversions could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations 
see item legal proceedings 
we could experience adverse effects on our revenues  profits and market share due to strong competition from numerous and sometimes larger companies 
we compete with stock brokerage firms  investment banking firms  insurance companies  banks  internet investment sites  and other financial institutions and individual registered investment advisers 
many of these companies not only offer mutual fund investments and services but also offer an ever increasing number of other financial products and services 
many of our competitors have more products and product lines  services  and brand recognition and may also have substantially greater assets under management 
many larger mutual fund complexes have developed relationships with brokerage houses with large distribution networks  which may enable those fund complexes to reach broader client bases 
in recent years  there has been a trend of consolidation in the mutual fund industry resulting in stronger competitors with greater financial resources than us 
there has also been a trend toward online internet financial services 
if existing or potential customers decide to invest with our competitors instead of with us  our market share  revenues  and income could decline 
the terms of our credit facility impose restrictions on our operations that may adversely impact our prospects and the operations of our business 
there are no assurances we will be able to raise additional capital if needed which could negatively impact our liquidity  prospects and operations 
we have entered into a day revolving credit facility with various lenders for a total of million  whereby the lenders could  at their option upon our request  expand the facility to million 
in august  we also began utilizing money market loans  which function similarly to commercial paper 
at december   there was no balance outstanding under the line of credit and the outstanding balance related to the money market loans was million 
the terms and conditions of our revolving credit facility and the money market loans impose restrictions that affect  among other things  our ability to incur additional debt  make capital expenditures and acquisitions  merge  sell assets  pay dividends  and create or incur liens 
our ability to comply with the financial covenants set forth in the credit facility can be affected by events beyond our control and there can be no assurance that we will achieve operating results that will comply with such terms and conditions  a breach of which could result in a default under the credit facility 
in the event of a default  the banks could elect to declare the outstanding principal amount of our credit facility  all interest thereon  and all other amounts payable under our credit facility to be immediately due and payable 
our ability to meet our cash needs and satisfy our debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance  asset values  perception of our creditworthiness  and indirectly  the market value of our stock 
these factors will be affected by prevailing economic  financial and business conditions and other circumstances  some of which are beyond our control 
we anticipate that borrowings from our existing credit facility or its refinancing  money market loans  and or cash provided by operating activities will provide sufficient funds to finance our business plans  meet our operating expenses  and service our debt obligations as they become due 
however  in the event that we require additional capital  there can be no assurance that we will be able to raise such capital when needed or on satisfactory terms  if at all  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance our credit facility upon its maturity or on favorable terms 
if we are unable to raise capital or obtain financing  we may be forced to incur unanticipated costs or revise our business plan 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
regulatory risk is substantial in our business 
non compliance with regulations or changes in regulations could have a significant impact on the conduct of our business and our prospects  revenues and earnings 
our investment management business is heavily regulated  primarily at the federal level 
noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations could result in sanctions being levied against us  including fines and censures  suspension or expulsion from a certain jurisdiction or market or the revocation of licenses 
noncompliance with applicable laws or regulations could adversely affect our reputation  prospects  revenues  and earnings 
in addition  changes in current legal  regulatory  accounting  tax  compliance requirements or in governmental policies could adversely affect our operations  revenues  and earnings by increasing expenses and reducing investor interest in certain products offered by the company  among other things 
there are no assurances that we will pay future dividends which could adversely affect our stock price 
our board of directors currently intends to continue to declare quarterly dividends on our class a common stock  however  the declaration and payment of dividends is subject to the discretion of our board 
any determination as to the payment of dividends  as well as the level of such dividends  will depend on  among other things  general economic and business conditions  our strategic plans  our financial results and condition  and contractual  legal  and regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends by us or our subsidiaries 
we are a holding company and  as such  our ability to pay dividends is subject to the ability of our subsidiaries to provide us with cash 
there can be no assurance that the current quarterly dividend level will be maintained or that we will pay any dividends in any future period s 
any change in the level of our dividends or the suspension of the payment thereof could adversely affect our stock price 
our ability to hire and retain key personnel and financial advisors is significant to our success and growth 
our continued success depends to a substantial degree on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to conduct our fund management and investment advisory business 
the market for qualified fund managers  investment analysts  and financial advisors is extremely competitive 
we are dependent on waddell reed advisors and select third party distributors to sell our mutual funds and other investment products 
our growth prospects will be directly affected by the quality  quantity  and productivity of financial advisors we are able to successfully recruit and retain 
there can be no assurances that we will be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain the required personnel 
there may be adverse effects on our revenues and earnings if our funds performance declines 
success in the investment management and mutual fund businesses is dependent on the investment performance of client accounts relative to market conditions and the performance of competing funds 
good relative performance stimulates sales of the funds shares and tends to keep redemptions low 
sales of the funds shares in turn generate higher management fees and distribution revenues 
good relative performance also attracts institutional and separate accounts 
conversely  poor relative performance results in decreased sales  increased redemptions of the funds shares and the loss of institutional and separate accounts  resulting in decreases in revenues 
failure of our funds to perform well could  therefore  have a material adverse effect on our revenues and earnings 
our revenues  earnings and prospects could be adversely affected if the securities markets continue to decline 
our results of operations are affected by certain economic factors  including the level of the securities markets 
these adverse economic factors may be exacerbated by war or terrorism 
the securities markets have declined in the past years  and investors have exhibited concerns over the integrity of the us financial markets as a result of recent  highly publicized financial scandals 
the continuation of adverse market conditions and lack of investor confidence  together with uncertainty surrounding terrorist threats and geopolitical tensions could result in investors withdrawing from the markets or decreasing their rate of investment  either of which could adversely affect our revenues  earnings  and growth prospects 
because our revenues are  to a large extent  investment management fees based on the value of assets under management  a decline in the value of these assets adversely affects our revenues 
our growth is dependent to a significant degree upon our ability to attract and retain mutual fund assets  and in an adverse economic environment  this may prove difficult 
our growth rate has varied from year to year and there can be no assurance that the average growth rates sustained in the recent past will continue 
the combination of adverse markets reducing sales and investment management fees could compound on each other and materially affect earnings 
adverse conditions in the us domestic stock market are particularly material to us due to high concentration of assets under management in that market 
it is uncertain when these market and economic conditions will improve 
potential misuse of funds and information in the possession of our employees and or advisors could result in liability to our clients and subject us to regulatory sanctions 
our financial advisors handle a significant amount of funds for our clients as well as financial and personal information 
although we have implemented a system of controls to minimize the risk of fraudulent taking or misuse of funds and information  there can be no assurance that our controls will be adequate or that taking or misuse by our employees and or financial advisors  can be prevented 
we could have liability in the event of a taking or misuse by our employees and or financial advisors and we could also be subject to regulatory sanctions 
although we believe that we have adequately insured against these risks  there can be no assurance that our insurance will be maintained or that it will be adequate to meet any future liability 
systems failure may disrupt our business and result in financial loss and liability to our clients 
our business is highly dependent on communications and information systems  including our mutual fund transfer agency system maintained by a third party service provider 
we are highly dependent on our ability to process a large number of transactions on a daily basis and the proper functioning of computer systems of third parties 
we rely heavily on financial  accounting  and other data processing systems 
if any of these systems do not function properly  we could suffer financial loss  business disruption  liability to clients  regulatory intervention  or damage to our reputation 
if our systems are unable to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions  our ability to expand could be affected 
although we have back up systems in place  we cannot be sure that any systems failure or interruption  whether caused by a fire  other natural disaster  power or telecommunications failure  acts of terrorism war or otherwise will not occur  or that back up procedures and capabilities in the event of any failure or interruption will be adequate 
there may be an adverse effect on our revenues and profits if our investors remove the assets we manage on short notice 
a majority of our revenues are derived from investment management agreements with our funds that  as required by law  are terminable on days notice 
each investment management agreement must be approved and renewed annually by the disinterested members of each fund s board or its shareholders  as required by law 
some of these investment management agreements may be terminated or may not be renewed  and new agreements may be unavailable 
in addition  mutual fund investors may redeem their investments in the funds at any time without any prior notice 
investors can terminate their relationship with us  reduce the aggregate amount of assets under management  or shift their funds to other types of accounts with different rate structures for any number of reasons  including investment performance  changes in prevailing interest rates  and financial market performance 
the decrease in revenues that could result from any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our stockholders rights plan could deter takeover attempts which some of our stockholders may believe to be in their best interest 
under certain conditions  the rights under our stockholders rights plan entitle the holders of such rights to receive shares of our class a common stock having a value equal to two times the exercise price of the right 
the rights are attached to each share of our outstanding class a common stock and generally are exercisable only if a person or group acquires or more of the voting power represented by our class a common stock 
our stockholders rights plan could impede the completion of a merger  tender offer  or other takeover attempt even though some or a majority of our stockholders might believe that a merger  tender offer  or takeover is in their best interests  and even if such a transaction could result in our stockholders receiving a premium for their shares of our stock over the then current market price of our stock 
provisions of our organizational documents could deter takeover attempts which some of our stockholders may believe to be in their best interest 
under our certificate of incorporation  our board has the authority  without action by our stockholders  to fix certain terms and issue shares of our preferred stock  par value per share 
actions of our board pursuant to this authority may have the effect of delaying  deterring  or preventing a change in control of the company 
other provisions in our certificate of incorporation and in our bylaws impose procedural and other requirements that could be deemed to have anti takeover effects  including replacing incumbent directors 
our board is divided into three classes  each of which is to serve for a staggered three year term after the initial classification and election  and incumbent directors may not be removed without cause  all of which may make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of our board 
in addition  as a delaware corporation we are subject to section of the delaware general corporation law 
with certain exceptions  section imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of or more of our voting stock 
we may have difficulty executing our acquisition strategy or integrating our acquired companies  which could negatively impact our growth and profits 
our business strategy continues to contemplate our selective pursuit of acquisitions and alliances that will add new products or alternative distribution systems to accelerate earnings growth 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to find suitable acquisition candidates at acceptable prices  have sufficient capital resources to realize our acquisition strategy or be successful in entering into definitive agreements for desired acquisitions 
in addition  we may not be successful in the integration of acquired companies 
an acquisition may not prove to add new products or distribution systems or otherwise be advantageous to us 
our holding company structure results in structural subordination and may affect our ability to fund our operations and make payments on our debt 
we are a holding company and  accordingly  substantially all of our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries 
as a result  our cash flow and our ability to service our debt  including million of our senior notes  is dependent upon the earnings of our subsidiaries  and we are dependent on the distribution of earnings  loans  or other payments by our subsidiaries to us 
our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and have no obligation to pay any amounts due on our debt or provide us with funds for our payment obligations  whether by dividends  distributions  loans  or other payments 
in addition  any payment of dividends  distributions  loans  or advances to us by our subsidiaries could be subject to statutory or contractual restrictions 
payments to us by our subsidiaries will also be contingent upon our subsidiaries earnings and business considerations 
our right to receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries upon their liquidation or reorganization  and therefore the right of the holders of our debt to participate in those assets  would be effectively subordinated to the claims of that subsidiary s creditors  including trade creditors 
in addition  even if we were a creditor of any of our subsidiaries  our rights as a creditor would be subordinate to any security interest in the assets of our subsidiaries and any indebtedness of our subsidiaries senior to that held by us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we utilize various financial instruments with certain inherent market risks  primarily related to interest rates and securities prices 
the principal risks of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices to which we are exposed relate to interest rates on debt and marketable securities 
generally  these instruments have not been entered into for trading purposes 
management actively monitors these risk exposures 
a portion of our risk is hedged with a derivative instrument  but fluctuations could impact our results of operations and financial position 
as a matter of policy  we only execute derivative transactions to manage exposures arising in the normal course of business and not for speculative or trading purposes 
the following information  together with information included in other parts of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  which are incorporated herein by reference  describe the key aspects of certain financial instruments that have market risk to us 
interest rate sensitivity our interest sensitive liabilities include our long term fixed rate senior notes and obligations for any balances outstanding under our credit facility or other short term borrowings 
increases in market interest rates would generally cause a decrease in the fair value of the senior notes and an increase in interest expense associated with short term borrowings and borrowings under the credit facility 
decreases in market interest rates would generally cause an increase in the fair value of the senior notes and a decrease in interest expense associated with short term borrowings and borrowings under the credit facility 
based upon short term borrowings outstanding at december   a fluctuation in market rates would impact interest expense by approximately million annually 
based upon long term borrowings outstanding at december   a fluctuation in market rates would impact interest expense by approximately million annually 
on march   our million fixed rate senior notes maturing in february the notes were effectively converted to variable rate debt by entering into an interest rate swap agreement whereby we have agreed with another party to exchange  at specified intervals  the difference between the fixed rate and various floating rate interest amounts  calculated using a notional amount of million 
the difference in the floating rate interest paid and the fixed rate interest received is recorded as an adjustment to interest expense during the period that the related debt is outstanding 
as of december   the floating rate being paid was 
the average floating rate paid on the interest rate swap for the year ended december  was 
the change in the fair value of the interest rate swap is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet by adjusting the carrying amounts of the notes by an offsetting amount for the swap 
under sfas  we account for the interest rate swap as a fair value hedge of the notes 
this interest rate swap is considered effective in hedging the changes in the fair value of the notes arising from changes in interest rates  and accordingly  there has been no impact on earnings resulting from any ineffectiveness associated with this transaction 
interest expense savings realized as a result of the hedge was approximately million for as of december   we have recorded a cumulative increase in other assets of million to reflect the fair value of the interest rate swap and a cumulative increase in long term debt of million to reflect the fair value of the notes 
available for sale investments sensitivity we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types and maturities 
our portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment grade debt securities and equity mutual funds 
these investments are generally classified as available for sale investments pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities and  are consequently recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income  net of tax 
any unrealized gain or loss is recognized upon the sale of the investment 
at any time  a sharp increase in interest rates or a sharp decline in the us stock market could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
if a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary by management  the cost basis of the individual security or mutual fund is written down to fair value as a new cost basis  and the amount of the write down is included in earnings 
conversely  declines in interest rates or a significant rise in the us stock market could have a material positive impact on our investment portfolio 
however  unrealized gains are not recognized until the investment is sold 
we do not currently hedge these exposures 
securities price sensitivity our revenues are dependent on the underlying assets under management in the funds to which investment advisory services are provided 
the funds include portfolios of investments comprised of various combinations of equity  bond  and other types of securities 
fluctuations in the value of these securities are common and are generated by numerous factors  including  without limitation  market volatility  the overall economy  inflation  changes in investor strategies  availability of alternative investment vehicles  government regulations and others 
accordingly  declines in any one or a combination of these factors  or other factors not separately identified  may reduce the value of investment securities and  in turn  the underlying assets under management on which our revenues are earned 
these declines have an impact in our investment sales  thereby compounding the impact on our earnings
