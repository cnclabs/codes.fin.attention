marketing strategies overview the company s sales of natural gas  crude oil  condensate and ngls are generally made at the market prices of those products at the time of sale 
therefore  even though the company sells significant volumes to major purchasers  the company believes other purchasers would be willing to buy the company s natural gas  crude oil  condensate and ngls at comparable market prices 
the company s marketing department actively manages sales of its oil and gas through anadarko energy services company aes  anadarko  anadarko canada corporation and anadarko holding 
the company markets its production to customers at competitive prices  maximizing realized prices while managing credit exposure 
the market knowledge gained through the marketing effort is valuable to the corporate decision making process 
the company also conducts trading activities for the purpose of generating profits on or from exposure to changes in market prices of gas  oil  condensate and ngls 
however  the company does not engage in market making practices nor does it trade in any non energy related commodities 
the company s trading risk position  typically  is a net short position that is offset by the company s natural long position as a producer 
the company s marketing function does not engage in round trip trades or participate in any marketing related partnerships 
essentially all of the company s trading transactions have a term of less than one year and most are less than three months 
see derivative instruments under item a of this form k 
during  all segments of the natural gas market experienced increased scrutiny of their financial condition  liquidity and credit 
this has been reflected in rating agency credit downgrades of many merchant energy trading companies 
in  anadarko has not experienced any material financial losses associated with credit deterioration of third party gas purchasers  however  in certain situations the company has declined to transact with some counterparties and changed its sales terms to require some counterparties to pay in advance or post letters of credit 
natural gas the north american natural gas market has grown significantly throughout the last years and management believes continued growth to be likely 
natural gas prices have been extremely volatile and are expected to continue to be so 
management believes the company s portfolio of exploration and development prospects should position anadarko to continue to participate in this growth 
aes is a full service marketing company offering supply assurance  competitive pricing  risk management services and other services tailored to its customers needs 
approximately of the company s gas production was sold through aes in the company also purchases some physical volumes for resale primarily from partners and producers near anadarko s production 
these purchases allow the company to aggregate larger volumes of gas and attract larger  creditworthy customers  which in turn enhances the value of the company s production 
the company sells natural gas under a variety of contracts and may also receive a service fee related to the level of reliability and service required by the customer 
the company has the marketing capability to move large volumes of gas into and out of the daily gas market to take advantage of any price volatility 
included in this strategy is the use of leased natural gas storage facilities and various derivative instruments 
anadarko holding was a party to several long term firm gas transportation agreements that supported the gas marketing program within the gathering  processing and marketing gpm business segment  which was sold in to duke energy duke 
most of the gpm s firm long term transportation contracts were transferred to duke in the gpm disposition 
one contract was retained  but is managed and operated by duke 
anadarko is not responsible for the operations of the contracts and does not utilize the associated transportation assets to transport the company s natural gas 
as part of the gpm disposition  anadarko holding agreed to pay duke if transportation market values fall below the fixed contract transportation rates  while duke will pay anadarko holding if the transportation market values exceed the contract transportation rates keep whole agreement 
the fair value of the short term portion of the firm transportation keep whole agreement is calculated with actively quoted natural gas basis prices 
basis is the difference in value between gas at various delivery points and the new york mercantile exchange nymex gas futures contract price 
management believes that natural gas basis price quotes beyond the next twelve months are not reliable indicators of fair value due to decreasing liquidity 
accordingly  the fair value of the long term portion is estimated based on historical natural gas basis prices  discounted at per year 
management also periodically evaluates the supply and demand factors such as expected drilling activity  anticipated pipeline construction projects  expected changes in demand at pipeline delivery points that may impact the future market value of the firm transportation capacity to determine if the estimated fair value should be adjusted 
in  and  approximately  and  respectively  of the company s gas production was sold under long term contracts to duke 
these sales represent  and  respectively  of total revenues in  and most of the company s gas production sold to duke is under a single agreement that expires at the end of the first quarter of volumes sold to duke under this contract may be delivered at a number of locations generally at the tailgate of processing facilities owned or operated by duke or its affiliates and typically in the general vicinity of the fields where produced 
the pricing of gas under this contract is market based and therefore varies monthly and by region 
crude oil  condensate and ngls anadarko s crude oil  condensate and ngls revenues are derived from production in the us  canada  algeria and other international areas 
most of the company s us crude oil and ngls production is sold under day evergreen contracts with prices based on marketing indices and adjusted for location  quality and transportation 
most of the company s canadian oil production is sold on a term basis of one year or greater 
oil from algeria is sold by tanker as saharan blend to customers primarily in the mediterranean area 
saharan blend is a high quality crude that provides refiners with large quantities of premium products like high quality jet and diesel fuel 
aes purchases and sells third party crude oil  condensate and ngls in the company s domestic and international market areas 
included in this strategy is the use of various derivative instruments 
gas gathering systems and processing anadarko s investment in gas gathering operations allows the company to better manage its gas production  improve ultimate recovery of reserves  enhance the value of gas production and expand marketing opportunities 
the company has invested million to build or acquire gas gathering systems over the last five years 
the vast majority of the gas flowing through these systems is from anadarko operated wells 
the company processes gas at various third party plants under agreements generally structured to provide for the extraction and sale of ngls in efficient plants with flexible commitments 
anadarko also processes gas and has interests in one operated plant and three non operated plants 
anadarko s strategy to aggregate gas through company owned and third party gathering systems allows anadarko to secure processing arrangements in each of the regions where the company has significant production

reserve replacement drilling activity is not the best measure of success for an exploration and production company 
anadarko focuses on growth  and profitability 
reserve replacement is the key to growth  and future profitability depends on the cost of finding oil and gas reserves  among other factors 
for the st consecutive year  anadarko more than replaced annual production volumes with proved reserves of natural gas  crude oil  condensate and ngls  stated on a barrel of oil equivalent boe basis 
during  anadarko s worldwide reserve replacement was of total production of mmboe 
the company s worldwide reserve replacement in was of total production of mmboe

over the last five years  the company s annual reserve replacement has averaged of annual production volumes 
excluding mergers  acquisitions and divestitures  anadarko s worldwide reserve replacement for was of total production compared to for and for the decrease in was partially due to a downward price revision of mmboe in venezuela 
see critical accounting policies 
excluding mergers  acquisitions and divestitures  the company s annual worldwide reserve replacement over the past five years averaged of annual production volumes 
anadarko continues to increase its energy reserves in the us in  the company replaced of its us production volumes with us reserves 
this compares to a us reserve replacement of in and in the company s us reserve replacement for the five year period was of production 
excluding mergers  acquisitions and divestitures  anadarko s us reserve replacement for  and was  and  respectively  of total production

cost of finding cost of finding represents the cost of proved reserves added during a specific period through all means  including all costs and reserve additions related to extensions and discoveries  revisions  improved recovery and purchases of proved reserves 
cost of finding results in any one year can be misleading due to the long lead times associated with exploration and development 
a better measure of cost of finding performance is over a five year period 
for the period  anadarko s worldwide finding cost was per boe 
the company s us finding cost for the same five year period was per boe 
excluding mergers and acquisitions  anadarko s worldwide and us finding costs for the five year period were per boe and per boe  respectively 
for the five year period  anadarko s worldwide finding cost was per boe and its us finding cost was per boe 
for the five year period  the company s worldwide and us finding costs excluding mergers and acquisitions were per boe and per boe  respectively 
for  anadarko s worldwide finding cost was per boe 
this compares to per boe in and per boe in anadarko s us finding cost for was per boe 
this compares to per boe in and per boe in excluding mergers and acquisitions  anadarko s worldwide finding cost for was per boe compared to per boe in and per boe in the company s us finding cost excluding mergers and acquisitions for was per boe compared to per boe in and per boe in worldwide finding costs in increased compared to due primarily to downward revisions of venezuelan reserves primarily related to higher prices see critical accounting policies and large investments made in leases in the eastern gulf of mexico that have not yet been drilled 
finding costs in were higher than due primarily to increases in oilfield services costs and increased exploration and development activity 
proved reserves at the end of and  anadarko s proved reserves were billion boe compared to billion boe at year end anadarko s proved reserves have grown over the past three years  primarily as a result of corporate acquisitions  successful exploration projects in the gulf of mexico and successful development drilling programs in major domestic fields in core areas onshore and offshore and in algeria 
the company s proved natural gas reserves at year end were trillion cubic feet tcf compared to tcf at year end and tcf at year end anadarko s proved gas reserves have increased since year end  as a result of corporate acquisitions  continued development activity onshore in the us and other producing property acquisitions 
anadarko s crude oil  condensate and ngls reserves at year end were billion barrels compared to billion barrels at year end and billion barrels at year end crude oil reserves have risen by over the last three years primarily due to corporate acquisitions  successful exploration projects in the gulf of mexico and successful development drilling programs in major domestic fields in core areas onshore and offshore and in algeria 
crude oil  condensate and ngls reserves comprise of the company s proved reserves at year end and and at year end at december   the present value discounted at of future net revenues from anadarko s proved reserves was billion  before income taxes  and billion  after income taxes  stated in accordance with the regulations of the securities and exchange commission sec and the financial accounting standards board fasb 
this present value was calculated based on prices at year end held flat for the life of the reserves  adjusted for any contractual provisions 
the after income taxes increase of billion or in compared to is primarily due to significantly higher natural gas and higher crude oil prices at year end  additions of proved reserves related to successful drilling worldwide and corporate acquisitions in see critical accounting policies and new accounting principles and recent developments under item and supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities unaudited in the consolidated financial statements under item of this form k 
the present value of future net revenues does not purport to be an estimate of the fair market value of anadarko s proved reserves 
an estimate of fair value would also take into account  among other things  anticipated changes in future prices and costs  the expected recovery of reserves in excess of proved reserves and a discount factor more representative of the time value of money and the risks inherent in producing oil and gas 
acquisitions and divestitures the company s strategy includes an asset acquisition and divestiture program 
in  anadarko acquired approximately mmboe of proved reserves  including mmboe located in the united states primarily from the howell corporation howell acquisition mmboe and including mmboe located in qatar 
in  the company acquired approximately mmboe of proved reserves  located in canada  primarily from the berkley acquisition mmboe  qatar and oman with the gulfstream resources canada limited gulfstream acquisition mmboe  and the united states mmboe 
in  anadarko acquired with the anadarko holding merger transaction approximately mmboe of proved reserves  located primarily in the united states  canada and latin america 
excluding corporate acquisitions  during  anadarko acquired through purchases and trades mmboe of proved reserves for million 
during the same time period  the company sold properties  either as a strategic exit from a certain area or asset rationalization in existing core areas  of mmboe with proceeds totaling million 
in  the company will continue to consider dispositions of certain producing properties in non core areas

capital resources and liquidity capital expenditures millions development   exploration  acquisitions of producing properties gathering and other capitalized interest and internal costs related to exploration and development costs total    excludes corporate acquisitions the company s primary focus for was to find additional oil and gas reserves and maintain company wide production 
anadarko s total capital spending in was billion  a decrease compared to the decrease from represents a million decrease in development spending  a million decrease in exploration and a million decrease in gathering and other spending 
the decrease in spending for development activities reflects the company s decision to focus on increasing its inventory of drilling prospects by identifying new reserves through exploration  rather than growing production through development during the down cycle for energy prices earlier in the year 
anadarko s total capital spending in was billion  a increase compared to the increase from represents a million increase in development spending  a million increase in exploration spending and a million increase in spending primarily for general properties and capitalized interest 
the development spending increase was primarily in the lower states  while the exploration spending increase was primarily in the gulf of mexico and the lower states 
the company funded its capital investment programs in  and primarily through cash flow  plus increases in long term debt  proceeds from property sales and issuances of common stock 
capital spending for has been initially set at billion  which is a slight decrease compared to the primary focus of the budget is to find additional oil and gas reserves and develop existing fields 
anadarko has allocated nearly billion to worldwide development projects  primarily for fields in the gulf of mexico  western canada  east and central texas  north louisiana  the western states and algeria 
approximately million is budgeted for exploration programs  mainly in western canada  the gulf of mexico  east texas  north louisiana and alaska 
about of the exploration budget will be for drilling compared to in the remainder of the exploration budget will be used for seismic and lease acquisitions 
see outlook on liquidity for a discussion of the sources of funds for capital spending

outlook on liquidity anadarko s net cash from operating activities in was billion compared to billion in and billion in the decrease in cash flow is attributed to a significant decrease in natural gas prices 
the company s original capital expenditure budget for has been set at billion and net cash from operating activities in is expected to be about billion 
the company plans to use a portion of cash flow to repay about million in debt 
cash flow from operations will vary depending upon  among other things  actual commodity prices received throughout the year 
the company intends to adjust capital expenditures to reflect changes in its cash flow from operations 
the company s cash flow and capital expenditure estimates for were based on prices far below where oil and gas prices were trading in the first quarter of if higher prices are realized  the company may expand the drilling program  make targeted acquisitions or further reduce debt 
the company has a stock buyback program to purchase up to billion in shares of anadarko common stock 
any stock repurchases for are not included in the announced capital expenditure budget and are not currently anticipated 
both exchange and over the counter traded financial derivative instruments are subject to margin deposit requirements 
margin deposits are required by the company whenever its unrealized losses with a counterparty exceed pre determined credit limits 
given the company s sizable hedge position and price volatility  the company may be required from time to time to advance cash to its counterparties in order to satisfy these margin deposit requirements 
during january and february  the company s margin deposit requirements have ranged from zero to million 
based on nymex future strip prices  the company s margin deposit requirement was million on march  anadarko believes that operating cash flow and existing or available credit facilities will be adequate to meet its capital and operating requirements for the company funds its day to day operating expenses and capital expenditures from operating cash flows  supplemented as needed by short term borrowings under commercial paper  money market loans or credit facility borrowings 
to facilitate such borrowings  the company has in place million in committed credit facilities  which are supplemented by various non committed credit lines that may be offered by certain banks from time to time at then quoted rates 
it is the company s policy to limit commercial paper borrowing to levels that are fully back stopped by unused balances from its committed credit facilities 
the company may choose to refinance certain portions of these short term borrowings by issuing long term debt in the public or private debt markets 
to facilitate such financings  the company may file shelf registrations in advance with the sec 
the company continuously monitors its debt position and coordinates its capital expenditure program with expected cash flows and projected debt repayment schedules 
the company will continue to evaluate funding alternatives  including property sales and additional borrowing  to secure other funds for additional capital expenditures and stock repurchases 
at this time  anadarko has no plans to issue common stock other than through its dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan  through the exercise of stock options  possible redemption of convertible debt securities or through the company s employee savings plan and employee stock ownership plan equity funded contributions

in  anadarko paid million in dividends to its common stockholders cents per share in the first  second and third quarters and cents per share in the fourth quarter 
the dividend amount in was million cents per share per quarter 
anadarko has paid a dividend to its common stockholders continuously since becoming an independent company in the company s credit agreements allow for a maximum capitalization ratio of debt  exclusive of the effect of any non cash write downs 
as of december   anadarko s capitalization ratio was debt 
while there is no specific restriction on paying dividends  under the maximum debt capitalization ratio retained earnings were not restricted as to the payment of dividends at december  the amount of future common stock dividends will depend on earnings  financial conditions  capital requirements and other factors  and will be determined by the board of directors on a quarterly basis

critical accounting policies financial statements and use of estimates the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of anadarko and its subsidiaries 
all significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated 
the company accounts for investments in affiliated companies generally to owned using the equity method of accounting 
the financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in preparing financial statements  management makes informed judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management reviews its estimates  including those related to litigation  environmental liabilities  income taxes and determination of proved reserves 
changes in facts and circumstances may result in revised estimates and actual results may differ from these estimates 
properties and equipment the company uses the full cost method of accounting for exploration and development activities as defined by the sec 
under this method of accounting  the costs for unsuccessful  as well as successful  exploration and development activities are capitalized as properties and equipment 
this includes any internal costs that are directly related to exploration and development activities but does not include any costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
gain or loss on the sale or other disposition of oil and gas properties is not recognized  unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and natural gas attributable to a country 
the application of the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties generally results in higher capitalized costs and higher dd a rates compared to the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas properties 
the sum of net capitalized costs and estimated future development and abandonment costs of oil and gas properties and mineral investments is amortized using the unit of production method 
all other properties are stated at original cost and depreciated on the straight line basis over the useful life of the assets  which ranges from three to years 
proved reserves proved oil and gas reserves  as defined by sec regulation s x rule a i  ii  iii  and  are the estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas  and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions  ie  prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made 
prices include consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements  but not on escalations based upon future conditions 
prices do not include the effect of derivative instruments entered into by the company 
proved developed oil and gas reserves are reserves that can be expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods 
additional oil and gas expected to be obtained through the application of fluid injection or other improved recovery techniques for supplementing the natural forces and mechanisms of primary recovery are included as proved developed reserves only after testing by a pilot project or after the operation of an installed program has confirmed through production response that increased recovery will be achieved 
proved undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage  or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for re completion 
reserves on undrilled acreage are limited to those drilling units offsetting productive units that are reasonably certain of production when drilled 
proved reserves for other undrilled units are claimed only where it can be demonstrated with certainty that there is continuity of production from the existing productive formation 
the company emphasizes that the volumes of reserves are estimates which  by their nature  are subject to revision 
the estimates are made using all available geological and reservoir data as well as production performance data 
these estimates  made by the company s engineers  are reviewed and revised  either upward or downward  as warranted by additional data 
revisions are necessary due to changes in assumptions based on  among other things  reservoir performance  prices  economic conditions and governmental restrictions 
decreases in prices  for example  may cause a reduction in some proved reserves due to uneconomic conditions 
under the terms of anadarko s risk service contract with the national oil company of venezuela  anadarko earns a fee that is translated into barrels of oil based on current prices economic interest method 
this means that higher oil prices reduce the company s reported production volumes and reserves from that project and lower oil prices increase reported production volumes and reserves 
production volume and reserve changes due to the prices used to determine the company s economic interest have no impact on the value of the project 
the following table shows the impact on at various price levels to demonstrate the effect of the economic interest method 
economic interest method nymex price per barrel revenues millions production volumes mmboe reserves mmboe costs excluded oil and gas properties include costs that are excluded from capitalized costs being amortized 
these amounts represent costs of investments in unproved properties and major development projects 
anadarko excludes these costs on a country by country basis until proved reserves are found or until it is determined that the costs are impaired 
all costs excluded are reviewed quarterly to determine if impairment has occurred 
the amount of any impairment is transferred to the costs to be amortized the dd a pool or a charge is made against earnings for those international operations where a reserve base has not yet been established 
for international operations where a reserve base has not yet been established  an impairment requiring a charge to earnings may be indicated through evaluation of drilling results  relinquishing drilling rights or other information 
costs excluded for oil and gas properties are generally classified and evaluated as significant or individually insignificant properties 
significant properties  comprised primarily of costs associated with domestic offshore blocks  alaska  the land grant and other international areas  are individually evaluated each quarter by the company s exploration and engineering staff 
non producing leases are evaluated based on the progress of the company s exploration program to date 
exploration costs are transferred to the dd a pool upon completion of drilling individual wells 
the company has a to year exploration and evaluation program for the land grant acreage 
costs will be transferred accordingly to the dd a pool over the length of the program 
the land grant s mineral interests both working and royalty interests are owned by the company in perpetuity 
all other significant properties are evaluated over a five to ten year period  depending on the lease term 
insignificant properties are comprised primarily of costs associated with onshore properties in the united states and canada 
non producing leases are transferred to the dd a pool over a three to five year period based on the average lease period 
exploration costs are transferred to the dd a pool upon completion of evaluation 
capitalized interest sfas no 
 capitalization of interest cost  provides standards for the capitalization of interest cost as part of the historical cost of acquiring assets 
under fasb interpretation fin no 
applying fasb statement no 
to oil and gas producing operations accounted for by the full cost method  costs of investments in unproved properties and major development projects  on which dd a expense is not currently taken and on which exploration or development activities are in progress  qualify for capitalization of interest 
capitalized interest is calculated by multiplying the company s weighted average interest rate on debt by the amount of qualifying costs excluded 
capitalized interest cannot exceed gross interest expense 
as costs excluded are transferred to the dd a pool  the associated capitalized interest is also transferred to the dd a pool 
ceiling test companies that use the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and development activities are required to perform a ceiling test each quarter 
the full cost ceiling test is an impairment test prescribed by sec regulation s x rule the ceiling test is performed on a country by country basis 
the test determines a limit  or ceiling  on the book value of oil and gas properties 
that limit is basically the after tax present value of the future net cash flows from proved crude oil and natural gas reserves 
this ceiling is compared to the net book value of the oil and gas properties reduced by any related deferred income tax liability 
if the net book value reduced by the related deferred income taxes exceeds the ceiling  an impairment or non cash write down is required 
a ceiling test impairment can give anadarko a significant loss for a particular period  however  future dd a expense would be reduced 
shown below is a summary of the ceiling test calculation and description of the major components 
ceiling test calculation present value of oil and gas properties pv costs excluded income taxes ceiling net oil and gas properties and equipment deferred income tax liability net investment ceiling net investment cushion write off after income taxes present value of oil and gas properties pv estimates of future net cash flows from proved reserves of gas  oil  condensate and ngls are made in accordance with sec regulation s x rule the present value of oil and gas properties represents the estimated future net cash flows from proved oil and gas reserves  discounted using a prescribed discount rate 
proved oil and gas reserve estimates  which are determined by the company s engineers  are reviewed and revised as reservoir performance  prices and other economic conditions change 
future net revenues are calculated based on estimated production volumes generally using the oil and gas prices in effect on the last day of the quarter  held flat for the life of the reserves 
future net revenues are reduced by estimated future production and development costs based on quarter end cost levels  assuming continuation of existing economic conditions 
due to the volatility of commodity prices  the oil and gas prices on the last day of the quarter significantly impact the calculation of the pv at year end  anadarko s ceiling tests were based on nymex prices of per mcf for natural gas and per barrel for crude oil 
the nymex prices are adjusted by location and quality differentials  as appropriate  to determine anadarko s realized prices 
the present value of future net cash flows does not purport to be an estimate of the fair market value of anadarko s proved reserves 
an estimate of fair value would also take into account  among other things  anticipated changes in future prices and costs  the expected recovery of reserves in excess of proved reserves and a discount factor more representative of the time value of money and the risks inherent in producing oil and gas 
costs excluded costs excluded are capitalized costs of investments in unproved properties and major development projects 
these costs are excluded from capitalized costs being amortized through dd a expense 
anadarko excludes all costs until proved reserves are found or until it is determined that the costs are impaired 
when proved reserves are found  the decrease in costs excluded is offset by an increase in pv  thereby  generally increasing the ceiling 
when proved reserves are not found  the decrease in costs excluded is not offset by an increase in pv  thereby  decreasing the ceiling 
income taxes future income taxes are based on the existing tax rates applied to the difference between the total of the present value of the future net cash flows plus costs excluded less the tax basis of the oil and gas properties 
the effect of tax loss carryforwards and credits related to oil and gas activities is considered in determining income taxes 
net oil and gas properties and equipment net oil and gas properties and equipment are the capitalized costs related to oil and gas activities less the accumulated dd a 
under the full cost method of accounting  the costs for unsuccessful  as well as successful  exploration and development activities are capitalized as properties and equipment 
the net capitalized costs are depreciated using the unit of production method 
net properties and equipment increase due to capital expenditures or acquisitions and decrease due to dd a expense  property divestitures or ceiling test impairments 
deferred income tax liability deferred income taxes related only to oil and gas properties are included in the deferred income tax liability 
derivative instruments anadarko uses derivative instruments for various risk management purposes 
effective january  derivative instruments utilized to manage or reduce commodity price risk related to the company s equity production were accounted for under the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
under this statement  all derivatives are carried on the balance sheet at fair value 
realized gains and losses are recognized in sales when the underlying physical gas and oil production is sold 
accordingly  realized derivative gains and losses are generally offset by similar changes in the realized value of the underlying physical gas and oil production 
realized derivative gains and losses are reflected in the average sales price of the physical gas and oil production 
accounting for unrealized gains and losses is dependent on whether the derivative instruments have been designated and qualify as part of a hedging relationship 
derivative instruments may be designated as a hedge of exposure to changes in fair values  cash flows or foreign currencies  if certain conditions are met 
unrealized gains and losses on derivative instruments that do not meet the conditions to qualify for hedge accounting are recognized currently in other income expense 
if the hedged exposure is to changes in fair value  the gains and losses on the derivative instrument  as well as the offsetting losses and gains on the hedged item  are recognized currently in earnings 
consequently  if gains and losses on the derivative instrument and the related hedge item do not completely offset  the difference ie  ineffective portion of the hedge is recognized currently in earnings 
if the hedged exposure is a cash flow exposure  the effective portion of the gains and losses on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings 
the ineffective portion of the gains and losses from the derivative instrument  if any  as well as any amounts excluded from the assessment of the cash flow hedges effectiveness are recognized currently in other income expense 
derivative instruments  as well as physical delivery purchase and sale contracts  utilized in the company s energy trading activities and in the management of price risk associated with the company s firm transportation keep whole commitment see derivative instruments under item a of this form k were accounted for under the mark to market accounting method pursuant to eitf issue no 
 accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management activities 
under this method  the derivatives and physical delivery contracts are revalued in each accounting period and unrealized gains and losses are recorded in the statement of income and carried as assets or liabilities on the balance sheet 
eitf issue no 
was rescinded in october as a result  mark to market accounting is precluded for energy trading contracts that are not derivatives pursuant to sfas no 
the recission of eitf issue no 
is effective for contracts entered into after october  and is effective for all contracts january  substantially all of the company s physical delivery energy trading contracts are considered to be derivatives pursuant to sfas no 
therefore  the recission of eitf issue no 
did not have a significant impact on the accounting for energy trading contracts as those contracts continue to be marked to market in accordance with sfas no 
the company s derivative instruments associated with the marketing and trading activities are generally either exchange traded or valued by reference to a commodity that is traded in a liquid market 
valuation is determined by reference to readily available public data 
option valuations are based on the black scholes option pricing model and verified against third party quotations 
the fair value of the short term portion of the firm transportation keep whole agreement is calculated with quoted natural gas basis prices 
basis is the difference in value between gas at various delivery points and the nymex gas futures contract price 
management believes that natural gas basis price quotes beyond the next twelve months are not reliable indicators of fair value due to decreasing liquidity 
accordingly  the fair value of the long term portion is estimated based on historical natural gas basis prices  discounted at per year 
management also periodically evaluates the supply and demand factors such as expected drilling activity  anticipated pipeline construction projects  expected changes in demand at pipeline delivery points  etc 
that may impact the future market value of the firm transportation capacity to determine if the estimated fair value should be adjusted 
new accounting principles and recent developments new accounting principles for information on new accounting principles see note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k 
proved reserves the sec is currently in the process of obtaining information from oil and gas exploration companies operating offshore including anadarko to assess the criteria being used by industry to determine proved reserves related to new field discoveries offshore 
the sec regulations allow companies to recognize proved reserves if economic producibility is supported by either an actual production test flow test or conclusive formation testing 
in the absence of a production test  compelling technical data must exist to recognize proved reserves related to the initial discovery of a field 
in deep water environments where production tests are extremely expensive  the industry has increasingly depended on advanced technical testing to support economic producibility 
anadarko has recorded proved reserves related to the initial discovery of four offshore fields based on conclusive formation tests rather than actual production tests 
as of december   these proved reserves amounted to mmboe or less than of anadarko s total worldwide proved reserves 
the company is currently developing all of these fields and expects the majority of the production from these fields to commence during anadarko believes the reserves were properly classified 
most of these reserves are located at marco polo  a deep water field under development at green canyon block ryder scott company  an independent petroleum consulting company  has reviewed anadarko s technical data and studies used to support the classification of proved reserves at the marco polo field 
ryder scott s review concludes that the reserves meet the sec s definition of proved reserves 
a copy of the ryder scott report is attached as exhibit to this form k 
anadarko has furnished the information requested to the sec and is unable to predict the likely outcome of the sec s staff review of this industry practice 
the issue is not expected to have a material impact on the company s proved reserves or financial results  however  if the issue is not favorably resolved  anadarko may be required to revise its proved reserve estimates  which would affect anadarko s finding costs per barrel  reserve replacement ratios and dd a expense  until flow tests are conducted or production commences 
regulatory matters and additional factors affecting business forward looking statements the company has made in this report  and may from time to time otherwise make in other public filings  press releases and discussions with company management  forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of concerning the company s operations  economic performance and financial condition 
these forward looking statements include information concerning future production and reserves  schedules  plans  timing of development  contributions from oil and gas properties  and those statements preceded by  followed by or that otherwise include the words believes  expects  anticipates  intends  estimates  projects  target  goal  plans  objective  should or similar expressions or variations on such expressions 
for such statements  the company claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of such statements are subject to various risks and uncertainties  and actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements due to a number of factors in addition to those discussed below and elsewhere in this form k and in the company s other public filings  press releases and discussions with company management 
anadarko undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements 
commodity pricing and demand crude oil prices continue to be affected by political developments worldwide  pricing decisions and production quotas of opec and the volatile trading patterns in the commodity futures markets 
natural gas prices also continue to be highly volatile 
in periods of sharply lower commodity prices  the company may curtail production and capital spending projects  as well as delay or defer drilling wells in certain areas because of lower cash flows 
changes in crude oil and natural gas prices can impact the company s determination of proved reserves and the company s calculation of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to oil and gas reserves 
in addition  demand for oil and gas in the us and worldwide may affect the company s level of production 
under the full cost method of accounting  a non cash charge to earnings related to the carrying value of the company s oil and gas properties on a country by country basis may be required when prices are low 
whether the company will be required to take such a charge depends on the prices for crude oil and natural gas at the end of any quarter  as well as the effect of both capital expenditures and changes to proved reserves during that quarter 
while this non cash charge can give anadarko a significant reported loss for the period  future expenses for dd a will be reduced 
environmental and safety the company s oil and gas operations and properties are subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection from the time oil and gas projects commence until abandonment 
these laws and regulations govern  among other things  the amounts and types of substances and materials that may be released into the environment  the issuance of permits in connection with exploration  drilling and production activities  the release of emissions into the atmosphere  the discharge and disposition of generated waste materials  offshore oil and gas operations  the reclamation and abandonment of wells and facility sites and the remediation of contaminated sites 
in addition  these laws and regulations may impose substantial liabilities for the company s failure to comply with them or for any contamination resulting from the company s operations 
anadarko takes the issue of environmental stewardship very seriously and works diligently to comply with applicable environmental and safety rules and regulations 
compliance with such laws and regulations has not had a material effect on the company s operations or financial condition in the past 
however  because environmental laws and regulations are becoming increasingly more stringent  there can be no assurances that such laws and regulations or any environmental law or regulation enacted in the future will not have a material effect on the company s operations or financial condition 
for a description of certain environmental proceedings in which the company is involved  see note contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this form k 
exploration and operating risks the company s business is subject to all of the operating risks normally associated with the exploration for and production of oil and gas  including blowouts  cratering and fire  any of which could result in damage to  or destruction of  oil and gas wells or formations or production facilities and other property and injury to persons 
as protection against financial loss resulting from these operating hazards  the company maintains insurance coverage  including certain physical damage  employer s liability  comprehensive general liability and worker s compensation insurance 
although anadarko is not insured against all risks in all aspects of its business  such as political risk  business interruption risk and risk of major terrorist attacks  the company believes that the coverage it maintains is customary for companies engaged in similar operations 
the occurrence of a significant event against which the company is not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position 
development risks the company is involved in several large development projects 
key factors that may affect the timing and outcome of such projects include project approvals by joint venture partners  timely issuance of permits and licenses by governmental agencies  manufacturing and delivery schedules of critical equipment  and commercial arrangements for pipelines and related equipment to transport and market hydrocarbons 
in large development projects  these uncertainties are usually resolved  but delays and differences between estimated and actual timing of critical events are commonplace and may  therefore  affect the forward looking statements related to large development projects 
domestic governmental risks the domestic operations of the company have been  and at times in the future may be  affected by political developments and by federal  state and local laws and regulations such as restrictions on production  changes in taxes  royalties and other amounts payable to governments or governmental agencies  price or gathering rate controls and environmental protection regulations 
foreign operations risk the company s operations in areas outside the us are subject to various risks inherent in foreign operations 
these risks may include  among other things  loss of revenue  property and equipment as a result of hazards such as expropriation  war  insurrection and other political risks  increases in taxes and governmental royalties  renegotiation of contracts with governmental entities  changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign based companies  currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations and other uncertainties arising out of foreign government sovereignty over the company s international operations 
the company s international operations may also be adversely affected by laws and policies of the united states affecting foreign trade and taxation 
to date  the company s international operations have not been materially affected by these risks 
competition the oil and gas business is highly competitive in the search for and acquisition of reserves and in the gathering and marketing of oil and gas production 
the company s competitors include the major oil companies  independent oil and gas concerns  individual producers  gas marketers and major pipeline companies  as well as participants in other industries supplying energy and fuel to industrial  commercial and individual consumers 
other regulatory agencies in certain states and countries have authority to issue permits for seismic exploration and the drilling of wells  regulate well spacing  prevent the waste of oil and gas resources through proration and regulate environmental matters 
operations conducted by the company on federal oil and gas leases must comply with numerous regulatory restrictions  including various nondiscrimination statutes 
additionally  certain operations must be conducted pursuant to appropriate permits issued by the bureau of land management and the minerals management service of the us department of the interior 
in addition to the standard permit process  federal leases and most international concessions require a complete environmental impact assessment prior to authorizing an exploration or development plan 
legal proceedings general the company is a defendant in a number of lawsuits and is involved in governmental proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business  including  but not limited to  royalty claims  contract claims and environmental claims 
the company has also been named as a defendant in various personal injury claims  including numerous claims by employees of third party contractors alleging exposure to asbestos and benzene while working at a refinery in corpus christi  texas  which anadarko holding sold in segments in and while the ultimate outcome and impact on the company cannot be predicted with certainty  management believes that the resolution of these proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the company  although results of operations and cash flow could be significantly impacted in the reporting periods in which such matters are resolved

derivative instruments held for non trading purposes the company had equity production hedges of billion cubic feet of natural gas and million barrels of crude oil as of december  as of december   the company had a net unrealized loss of million before taxes on these commodity derivative instruments 
based upon an analysis utilizing the actual derivative contractual volumes  a increase in commodity prices would result in an additional loss on these commodity derivative instruments of approximately million 
however  this loss would be substantially offset by a gain in the value of that portion of the company s equity production that is hedged 
derivative instruments held for trading purposes as of december   the company had a net unrealized gain of million gains of million and losses of million on commodity derivative instruments entered into for trading purposes and a net unrealized loss of million gains of million and losses of million on physical contracts entered into for trading purposes 
based upon an analysis utilizing the actual derivative contractual volumes and assuming a decrease in underlying commodity prices  the potential additional loss on the derivative instruments would be approximately million 
firm transportation keep whole agreement anadarko holding company anadarko holding was a party to several long term firm gas transportation agreements that supported its gas marketing program within its gathering  processing and marketing gpm business segment  which was sold in to duke energy duke 
as part of the gpm disposition  anadarko holding agreed to pay duke if transportation market values fall below the fixed contract transportation rates  while duke will pay anadarko holding if the transportation market values exceed the contract transportation rates keep whole agreement 
this keep whole agreement will be in effect until the earlier of each contract s expiration date or february the company may periodically use derivative instruments to reduce its exposure under the keep whole agreement to potential decreases in future transportation market values 
due to decreased liquidity  the use of derivative instruments to manage this risk is generally limited to the forward twelve months 
as of december   accounts payable included million and other long term liabilities included million related to this agreement 
as of december   accounts payable included million and other long term liabilities included million related to this agreement

interest rate risk anadarko is also exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of the company s variable and fixed interest rate debt 
the company believes the potential effect that reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates may have on the fair value of the company s various debt instruments is not material 
foreign currency risk the company s canadian subsidiaries use the canadian dollar as their functional currency 
the company s other international subsidiaries use the us dollar as their functional currency
