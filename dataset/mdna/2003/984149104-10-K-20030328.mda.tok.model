the mobile assistant ma series is the company s primary line of hardware products  the current versions of which are the mobile assistant v ma v and ma tc 
since its commercial introduction in  the company has recognized revenue of approximately  on sales of approximately  units of the ma series 
during  the company introduced the atigo product line  a family of wireless web panels that can be used either as stand alone handheld personal computers pcs or as displays for an ma system  a laptop or a conventional pc 
the company derives its revenues from sales of its wearable computers  software products and consulting services 
in the future  the company expects to obtain additional revenues from the licensing of its intellectual property 
a number of trends are expected to have a significant effect on the company s operations in the future 
in recent quarters  many of the company s large customers deferred or delayed anticipated purchases of company products because of uncertain economic conditions 
if these conditions persist or worsen  it is possible that more potential customers will defer  delay or cancel scheduled purchases  which would have an adverse effect on company operations 
while the company expects general economic conditions to begin improving during the second half of  there can be no assurance that this expectation will be realized 
additionally  to the extent that potential customers have concerns about purchases from smaller suppliers as a result of challenging economic conditions for small capitalization technology companies  such concerns could have a negative impact on the company s revenues 
beginning with the widespread use of the internet on desktop computers  there has been an increasing demand for mobile computing and wireless communications devices that can bring the desktop internet experience to mobile users 
the rapid growth of internet enabled cell phones  pdas  interactive pagers and similar products result in a growing number of devices that cater to the mobile data user and which may compete with the company s products and which may also present opportunities for licensing in the future 
the company believes that sales of its wearable and mobile computers will rely to a large extent on the availability of wireless broadband services that can take advantage of the extensive processing power and display capabilities of the company s hardware products 
wireless lans are now well established in commercial markets worldwide that provide broadband capabilities over a limited physical range in places such as corporate offices  warehouses  factory floors and airfields 
however  wide range wireless access that allows a user to move freely over large geographic areas and still maintain broadband access commonly referred to as third generation or g is still only available in limited areas  including japan and certain european nations 
the company predicts that g service will be available in large metropolitan areas worldwide in the next few years 
for example  ntt docomo has announced plans to launch g service in select us cities in the company believes that while the commercial markets can still be successfully penetrated prior to the widespread introduction of wireless broadband access  such service will be needed prior to successful large scale sales in the far larger consumer markets 
critical accounting policies in accounting for the financial results of the company s operations  management employs several critical accounting methods and policies and makes estimates and assumptions which materially affect the manner in which such results are presented 
the company s critical accounting policies are as follows inventory and tooling 
inventory consists primarily of wearable computer component parts held for resale and allocated tooling costs  and is primarily comprised of finished goods 
the capitalized tooling asset consists of payments made to third party vendors for their products and services that are used in the manufacture of the company s proprietary hardware products 
periodically  the company records charges and reserves against its inventory and tooling asset balances 
to determine the size of the charges and reserves to record  if any  management performs a review of the carrying value of its inventory and tooling 
as a result of this review  it may be determined that certain of the company s inventory is slow moving  risks becoming obsolete or may likely be sold at below historical cost 
based upon a specific review of the carrying costs for the inventory items  management estimates the quantity of each inventory item that the company expects to be able to sell and  if appropriate  quantifies inventory amounts that may not be recoverable 
subsequent to recording such charges and reserves  if any  management does not expect to record significant profits or losses upon the ultimate sale of this inventory 
this review is based on a number of assumptions and estimates made by management  including but not limited to those related to the introduction of new and competing product lines  the company s ability to sell the quantities of inventory on hand as well as the quantities expected to be received in the future  the net sales price the company ultimately expects to achieve  the introduction of competing products  customer demand and general economic conditions 
this analysis takes into account estimated price concessions which management believes are likely to be necessary in disposing of this inventory 
to the extent that actual future events are different from the assumptions and estimates used by management  additional charges  reserves or adjustments may be recorded by the company 
the capitalized tooling asset is systematically allocated to inventory and property and equipment and is amortized as a component of cost of sales or depreciation based upon the number of units sold or used as demonstration units in a given period compared to the total number of units management expects to make in a product s production run 
management s expectation of the number of units to be made during a given product s production run is based on a number of assumptions and estimates  including but not limited to those related to the introduction of new product lines  the company s ability to procure and sell the quantities of inventory  the introduction of competing products  customer demand and general economic conditions 
to the extent that actual future events are different from the assumptions and estimates used by management  additional charges  reserves or adjustments may be recorded by the company 
patents 
the company capitalizes legal fees  filing fees and other direct costs incurred to obtain patents and trademarks 
these costs are amortized over a five year period which management believes approximates the economic life of such patents even though the legal life of the patents is usually longer 
the costs of maintaining patents are expensed as incurred 
whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that there is the potential for the impairment of the carrying values of these patent assets  management performs an analysis to determine the recoverability of the asset s carrying value 
as a result of such analysis  management may reserve against or write down the carrying value of the patent asset 
as part of the company s cost cutting efforts undertaken during and  management performed an extensive cost benefit analysis of its patent portfolio 
as a result of this review  the company decided to maintain all patents that have already been granted as well as all those pending that management considers its key patents  including those related to wearable computers  the transferable core  way point and the dual use computing device 
this review resulted in a write down of the carrying value of certain patents of  in the restructuring charge 
however  the company concluded that it could achieve considerable cost savings by not investing significant future time or capital resources on certain of its foreign patent applications 
management believes that these cost savings can occur while not materially negatively impacting the company s business plan 
the patents that the company expects to not pursue are often those that are not significantly through the patent application process 
this is due to the fact that the process of having a patent granted is expensive while the process of maintaining a patent subsequent to grant is relatively inexpensive 
additionally  due to the concentration of revenues  the strategic importance of the company s us operations  and the lower cost of obtaining a patent in the us  the company expects to continue to pursue all domestic patents  whether granted or pending 
additionally  the company has determined to not pursue patents pending in other instances  including those in which it determined that it had filed for patents for which it has similar or better protection through other patents in its portfolio  in countries that do not play a strategic role in the company s current business plan or that it has otherwise determined will likely not meet the internal criteria management deems necessary to justify the continued cost to complete the patent application process 
these reviews were based on a number of assumptions and estimates made by management  including but not limited to those related to the outcome of potential litigation against competitors who may infringe on the company s patents  the outcome of potential litigation brought against the company related to infringement of another company s patents  impairment of trade secrets and know how and the company s intentions to use a given patent in the future 
to the extent that actual future events are different from the assumptions and estimates used by management  additional charges  reserves or adjustments may be recorded by the company 
warranties for hardware product sales 
for sales of its hardware products within the us  the company generally provides a standard one year warranty on its parts and a six month warranty on labor 
the company s suppliers for the significant components of the company s hardware products  including the computing unit  fpd  hmd and batteries  provide the company with similar warranties 
the company s distribution partners are generally responsible for user and software support for channel sales 
in certain instances  the company offers extended warranties for up to two years beyond the standard one year warranty on atigo and the ma v 
the supplier of atigo provides the company with a corresponding warranty 
the company is negotiating with the suppliers of the ma to offer similar warranties to the company with similar terms to the extended warranties offered to the company s customers 
in the event that the company is not able to obtain such warranties from its suppliers  the company may incur warranty expenses in the future that are significantly greater than those incurred in the past 
warranty expense is recorded by management using a number of assumptions and estimates  including but not limited to those related to estimates for future warranty claims based on reviews of historical warranty experience as well as other general and customer specific factors  industry warranty trends  intended uses by customers  successful negotiation of extended warranty coverage from the company s vendors and continued warranty support from vendors 
additionally  because of the recent introduction of the ma v  ma tc and atigo product lines  the company only has limited historical data on which to forecast future warranty claims 
to the extent that actual future events are different from the assumptions and estimates used by management  additional warranty expenses may be recorded by the company 
revenue recognition on fixed price contracts 
the company recognizes revenue from long term service contracts in accordance with accounting research bulletin no 
 long term construction type contracts  using the relevant guidance in statement of position no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  as determined by the terms and conditions of the company s various consulting contracts with its customers  which typically involve software engineering and related services 
revenue is recognized in fixed price contracts based on the percentage of completion method by calculating the ratio of costs incurred over total estimated costs to complete 
historically  the company has not recorded losses related to its fixed price contracts 
however  in the event that the costs to complete increase  or are anticipated to increase  to a level that will result in a negative gross margin to the company  a loss will be recognized in the period that this determination is made 
possible events that could cause the total estimated costs to complete a project to change include  but are not limited to  the occurrence of unanticipated complications  technical or otherwise  changes to a client s requirements  general inefficiencies in the management of the engagement  a change in key personnel or the cost of personnel 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain consolidated financial data as a percentage of revenues for the years ended december   and december  revenue cost of sales provision for inventory and tooling gross income operating expenses sales and marketing general and administrative research and development restructuring charges merger costs total operating expenses interest and other net loss years ended december  and december  revenue 
the company derives its revenue from product sales of its mobile wearable computers and components  product sales of software and consulting services 
total revenue for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or  compared to  for the year ended december  product revenue for the year ended december  was  an increase of  or  compared to  for the increase in product revenue was attributable to sales of the company s mobile wearable computer systems  which increased from  in to  in the increase in hardware sales resulted primarily from sales of two new product lines introduced in  the poma and atigo 
additional hardware product revenue resulted from the company s emphasis on new and enhanced product lines  the ma v and ma tc  which were introduced late in hardware revenues from us operations increased to  in compared to  driven primarily by atigo and ma v sales 
this increase was offset by a decrease to  in european hardware sales in compared to  due primarily to a decrease in orders from a large european customer 
hardware revenues from asia  consisting primarily of ma v systems  decreased by to  in compared to offsetting this overall increase in wearable computer sales was a decrease in software product revenue from  in to in revenue from software products generally consists of a few large transactions that occur throughout the year that are unrelated to the company s hardware products 
therefore  it is not uncommon to have significant fluctuations in software revenue from year to year 
the company s consulting  licensing and other revenue remained consistent between the year ended december  and at  and  respectively  representing a decrease  as the number of ongoing consulting contracts remained relatively consistent between and cost of sales 
the company s cost of sales include the costs of components for the company s wearable computer product lines  purchased software  direct labor and materials  amortization of tooling costs  warranty costs  fulfillment and shipping costs  and inventory and tooling reserves 
total cost of sales remained consistent between the year ended december  and at  and  respectively  representing less than a one percent decrease 
the cost of sales related to the company s hardware products increased to  for the year ended december  this increase in hardware product cost of sales is significantly greater than the increase in hardware product sales 
this fluctuation was caused by several factors 
first  total warranty costs for the year ended december  increased  compared to the same period in due to certain charges for product replacement related to sales of the ma v to two of the company s us customers 
the company believes that the warranty expenses specific to these customers were non recurring in nature and does not anticipate that it will continue to record similar warranty expenses in the future 
in addition  margins on sales of the ma v and tc were higher in the period than in the period  since both the ma v and ma tc product lines were introduced in and margins are typically highest following a product s commercial launch 
partially offsetting the above factors which negatively affected hardware margins  the company began shipping the atigo product line in the third quarter of  which resulted in a positive effect on margins 
as a result of these activities  gross margins from hardware sales for the year ended december  were  compared to for software cost of sales decreased from  for the year ended december  to for the same period in as the company had no software sales in the lack of high margin software sales impacts negatively on the company s gross margin from product sales which decreased to for the fiscal year from for cost of sales of consulting  licensing and other revenue decreased  which is relatively consistent with the decrease in consulting  license and other revenue 
this resulted in an increase in related margins to in from in  due primarily to an increase in the mix of higher margin contracts in when compared to the company recognized inventory and tooling provisions of  and  in the fiscal years and  respectively  related to its wearable computer product lines which are discussed in detail below 
total gross margins  including the provisions for inventory and tooling  were and  for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the inventory and tooling provision consisted of i a  charge to write down the net carrying value of inventory associated with the ma v  ma tc and ma iv product lines due to an estimated general decline in their value  ii a  charge related to a write down of a small number of early production models of the ma v product line with limited hard disk capacity received by the company  iii the  reversal of an inventory reserve recorded in related to the poma product line  a prior model of wearable computer  discussed below  iv a  reserve against tooling associated with the ma v product line 
the inventory and tooling provision consisted of i a  charge to reduce the net carrying value of inventory associated with the ma iv product line given the uncertainties created by the introduction of the ma v and ma tc product lines  ii a  inventory write off established for hard disk drives that were purchased for the ma v product line but later replaced with higher capacity hard disk drives during the first quarter of  all of the hard drives were sold in bulk at an amount approximating their net carrying value and this reserve was fully utilized  iii the  inventory charge recorded in related to the poma product line discussed below and iv a  charge to reduce the net carrying value of tooling associated with the ma iv product line 
in  a charge of  was recorded to reflect management s estimate of losses to be incurred on the total initial production run of the poma product line 
the company elected to sell the poma systems at prices that are less than their initial production costs to favorably position poma in the price sensitive light commercial and near consumer markets 
although the poma inventory had not been received by the company as of december   the company recorded the expected losses during  which was the period in which the underlying contracts were entered into 
because the inventory had not been received by the company as of december   and was therefore not recorded as an asset  this charge was recorded as an accrued liability which was being reclassified to an inventory reserve as poma inventory shipments were received during during  the company entered into an agreement with the manufacturer of poma through which the company was relieved of its obligation to purchase additional poma units 
pursuant to the terms of this agreement  the company made a payment of  during and reduced certain of the royalty rates that are used to calculate the licensing fees that the company receives from the manufacturer for its sales of poma or other wearable computer products 
during  the remaining accrued liability balance  net of the  payment  was reversed  resulting in a  reduction to the provision for inventory and tooling reserve 
the company s management believes that it can sell its wearable mobile computer inventory at amounts that approximate current net carrying values  which have been reduced as a result of the above charges 
to determine the size of the charges to record  management reviewed the carrying value of its inventory in light of the introduction of new and competing product lines  its ability to sell the quantities of inventory on hand as well as the quantities expected to be received in the future and the sales prices it ultimately expects to achieve 
this analysis took into account estimated price concessions which management believes are likely to be necessary in disposing of this inventory 
as a result of this review  it was determined that certain of the company s inventory is slow moving  risked becoming obsolete or will likely be sold at below its historical cost 
based upon a specific review of the carrying costs for the inventory items  management estimated the quantity of each inventory item that the company was expected to be able to sell and also quantified inventory amounts that may not be recoverable 
management does not expect to record significant profits or losses upon the ultimate sale of this inventory 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  were  a decrease of  or  compared to  for the same period in included in sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  is a  non cash charge related to the cancellation of an agreement for marketing services and certain retail space at the waldorf astoria hotel in new york city

commitments inventory 
at december   the company had commitments to purchase inventory  tooling and engineering and other services from its suppliers and manufacturers related to its current and future hardware product lines 
the company expects that it will enter into similar commitments in the future as it designs  develops and procures future wearable computer product lines 
under its original agreements with ibm  the company was obligated to purchase certain components of the ma v system  including  computing units  as well as various numbers of fpds and other accessories 
the total cost to the company of these purchases would have been over approximately  under the original agreements  the company had the right to cancel this purchase commitment by paying a cancellation fee in an amount of approximately  in march  the company entered into an agreement with ibm under which the company was released of its obligation to pay the penalty or procure this inventory other than  in ma v computing units  fpds  peripherals and component parts 
the final pricing provided to the company represents a discount from the original contractual prices 
under the march agreement  ibm will ship inventory monthly from march through december and the company will remit payments monthly from march through january ibm global finance is providing a credit facility to the company which will provide credit to the company for purchases of inventory under the march agreement 
in connection with this credit facility  ibm global finance was granted a security interest in certain of the company s assets and the company obtained a letter of credit from a third party lender for the benefit of ibm global finance in the amount of  for which the company posted an equal amount of restricted cash 
this security interest does not include patents and intellectual property 
in addition to the above obligation to ibm related to the ma v  the company has commitments to purchase computing units  flat panel and head mounted displays  miscellaneous computing components as well as engineering and other services from its various vendors related to the ma v  atigo  ma tc and future product lines 
the company believes that  if needed  the timing and amount of many of these shipments  services and payments may be adjusted through the payment of cancellation fees  contract negotiations or the satisfaction of obligations through the issuance of the company s equity securities 
however  there can be no assurance that the company can or will successfully modify these contracts or commitments 
excluding the potential impact of contract modifications  the company estimates that it will make total payments of approximately  during related to current inventory commitments at the time of this filing  which amount includes the commitment to purchase the additional ma v products from ibm monthly during  discussed above 
the company expects that it will enter into similar inventory and engineering commitments in the future as it designs  develops and procures future wearable computer product lines 
operating leases and other 
the company leases operating facilities and equipment under operating leases expiring on various dates through future minimum payments under noncancelable operating leases at december  are for the year ending december  other liquidity and capital resources disclosures at december   the company had accounts receivable  net of allowances  of  an increase of  or  from the december  balance of  this fluctuation was roughly in line with the increase in total revenues from to and management does not believe that it was caused by qualitative factors related to the company s business such as changes in credit terms  slower paying customers or the impact of a change in economic environment 
included in the accounts receivable at december  is accounts receivable of  associated with a december sale for which we collected the balance in in addition  accounts receivable at december  include  of unbilled accounts receivable representing amounts earned and recorded under the percentage of completion method of accounting on a long term contract of xsi 
the company expects to bill this amount in its entirety in upon reaching certain milestones in the contract 
the deferred revenue balances at december  and result primarily from billings to customers that were in excess of revenue recognized on service contracts 
such deferred revenue will be recognized as revenue as the revenue recognition criteria are met 
the company has recorded net losses since its inception  including during the periods presented in this form k 
these losses are primarily attributable to the operating expenses incurred by the company to design  develop  market and sell its wearable computer products and to provide general and administrative support for these operating activities 
during these periods  the company s revenues and gross margins have not been sufficient to fund these operating activities 
as a result  the company has consistently recorded negative cash flows from operating activities and net losses and had an accumulated deficit of  at december  the combination of the company s operating losses and its working capital requirements has severely impacted the company s financial position and liquidity 
at december   the company had unrestricted cash on hand of  and accounts payable and accrued expenses of  certain of these liabilities are past their stated terms of payment  including those owed to vendors that provide services and inventory which are required by the company to execute its business plan 
in general  any company that does not pay its suppliers in a timely manner is at risk of being forced into an involuntary bankruptcy proceeding instituted by creditors  which may provide for the liquidation of assets or the reorganization of assets and debts 
the company generally believes that it has a reasonably good relationship with most of its vendors and creditors 
however certain of its vendors have filed legal actions to recover overdue accounts payables and ceased providing services and products to the company 
there can be no assurances that other vendors will not pursue similar actions 
during  and  the company funded its operating and investing activities through its financing activities  which consist primarily of private placements of common stock  warrant and stock option exercises and borrowings 
the company s management has taken steps that it believes are necessary to improve the company s operations and raise additional capital  both of which are needed to enhance its ability to meet its cash flow needs through december  and thereafter 
beginning in april and continuing through the date of this filing  management has performed reviews of the company s operations and implemented various cost cutting programs to significantly reduce the company s operating expenses 
assuming there are no significant changes to the company s business plan  management expects to maintain savings of over from annualized fourth quarter levels 
in the fourth quarter of  management met its initial target to reach a quarterly operating expense level of between  and  future significant fluctuations may still occur as a result of non recurring charges associated with cost saving initiatives as well as the company s research and development activities  which will vary depending on the company s wearable mobile computer product development cycle during any given period 
as indicated in the chart below  through the fourth quarter of  the company had reduced its net operating expenses by from annualized fourth quarter levels 
change from net operating fourth quarter change from expenses of prior quarter fourth quarter of first quarter of second quarter of third quarter of fourth quarter of the company s management uses the measurement of net operating expenses in reviewing the results of its operations as well as in analyzing the impact of the various cost saving initiatives it has implemented or plans to implement in the future 
when used herein  net operating expenses represents total operating expenses as reported on the company s consolidated statements of operations as reported in accordance with us gaap as adjusted for restructuring charges as reported in accordance with us gaap as well as certain other non recurring transactions that do not meet the criteria for recordation as restructuring charges 
management believes that by reviewing net operating expenses  it is better able to focus on the company s recurring operations than it would be if it reviewed total operating expenses  which include charges such as severance payments to terminated employees  charges related to reductions in facilities and other large charges related to non recurring activities 
the net operating expense balances presented above reconcile to the amounts included on the company s consolidated statements of operations as follows fourth quarter first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter of of of of of total operating expenses restructuring charges charges for cancellation of waldorf astoria agreement reserve  and subsequent reversal  of note receivable net operating expenses the key cash saving initiatives that have been  and will continue to be  implemented are listed below worldwide headcount will have been reduced by from approximately full time equivalent employees to approximately full time employees 
the company s worldwide engineering and product functions have been consolidated 
operations in asia were significantly reduced  especially related to direct sales  marketing and product efforts 
future asian operations will focus primarily on channel sales  potential business combinations and business development 
the company s branch operations in japan  which focused primarily on product efforts  were closed 
the company s subsidiary xybernaut kk  which focuses primarily on sales and marketing  was not closed 
operations in europe were significantly reduced  especially related to direct sales and marketing efforts 
future european operations will focus primarily on channel sales  sales and marketing relationships with strategic partners  business development and research and development 
participation in trade shows has been reduced 
an agreement was reached with the manufacturer of the poma product line through which the company eliminated its obligation to purchase approximately  in additional systems 
an agreement was reached with the manufacturer of the ma v product line through which the company received a discount on certain inventory commitments originally scheduled for purchase during and and eliminated over approximately  in obligations to purchase additional systems as well as a potential cancellation fee of approximately  under this agreement  the company is required to purchase  in additional ma v systems  primarily during an agreement with a vendor to provide the company with marketing services and certain retail space at the waldorf astoria hotel in new york city was canceled 
management expects to not invest significant future time or capital resources pursuing certain of its foreign patent applications 
agreements with certain consultants  vendors and partners have been  and will continue to be  cancelled or renegotiated in order to minimize cash expenditures through the issuance of the company s equity securities  the renegotiation of terms and a reduction or elimination of services 
other various reductions in discretionary costs have been  and will continue to be  implemented 
subsequent to these changes  management believes that the company s staffing and resources will be sufficient to carry out its business plan for the foreseeable future 
in addition to the cost cutting initiatives detailed above  management continues to review all aspects of the company s operations and may take additional actions to reduce operating expenses further 
at the forecasted levels discussed above  management expects that the company will incur operating expenses of between  and  during the company will also be required to fund inventory procurement and other expenditures 
while management expects to fund a portion of these activities through gross profits resulting from revenues  the company will be required to obtain most of such amounts through outside financings 
potential sources of additional financing include private equity offerings  warrant exercises  strategic investments and various forms of debt financing 
in certain instances  concurrently with the exercise of certain of these warrants the exercise prices were reduced 
such reduction has resulted in the issuance of substantially more shares of common stock than would have occurred had the warrants been exercised at their original exercise prices 
the company may reduce the exercise price of additional warrants in the future 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage of ownership of current stockholders of the company will be reduced and if additional funds are raised at current prices for the company s stock  such dilution could be significant 
if additional funds are raised through borrowings  the company will be subject to interest charges and principal repayments  will likely be required to comply with financial covenants or other restrictions  and will likely have to collateralize such borrowings with its assets  which could be taken by the lender in the event of default 
during  the company raised  in cash through sales of its common stock to institutional investors  through warrant and stock option exercises and through borrowings that were repaid through the issuance of common stock 
subsequent to december   the company raised over approximately  in additional funds through warrant exercises  sales of its common stock to institutional investors and borrowings 
management anticipates that additional funds will be needed from additional private placements later in due in large part to the company s current stock price  the depressed general capital markets and cost cutting efforts described above  the individual equity financings that the company has completed in recent quarters have been of a smaller size when compared to those transacted in previous periods 
the equity markets  especially for small capitalization technology stocks  have remained depressed  and the us and world economies have generally been in a decline or recession 
if a sustained decline in the general equity markets  the price of the company s common stock  or the us or world economy were to occur  the company could face difficulties in its ability to raise additional capital 
additionally  the company has historically made several private placements of its common stock per year  primarily to a limited number of institutional investors who specialize in making similar types of investments 
if these institutional investors were to choose to not participate in future private placements  the company could face difficulties in its ability to raise additional capital 
on july   the company received notice from nasdaq that the company s common stock had closed below per share for consecutive trading days 
effective october   the company was granted a transfer to the nasdaq smallcap market 
effective january   the company was provided an extension until july  for the stock price to close above for ten consecutive trading days 
on january   nasdaq issued a press release in which it announced plans to extend a pilot program governing bid price rules for all nasdaq national market and nasdaq small cap issuers 
the proposal will allow issuers that meet heightened financial requirements to benefit from extended compliance periods for satisfying minimum bid price requirements 
the proposed rule changes would 
amongst other changes 
extend the bid price grace period for smallcap issuers demonstrating compliance with the core smallcap initial listing criteria from to up to days approximately months 
compliance with this standard will be verified every days 
nasdaq will present the overall plan to the securities and exchange commission for approval prior to implementing the proposed changes 
the company is currently in compliance with all such listing criteria and management anticipates it will remain in compliance in the future 
however  there can be no assurances that the company will be able to remain in compliance in the future or that the sec will grant the nasdaq the requisite approval to adopt this proposal 
prior to the delisting of the company s common stock  the company can appeal nasdaq for an extension or for other remedies 
if necessary  management intends to fully exercise all of its rights and options to maintain its listing 
if the company is unable to remain on the smallcap market  it may be forced to trade on the over the counter bulletin board or pink sheets markets  which would significantly reduce the liquidity in the stock and interest of potential investors in purchasing the stock 
the company s management believes that under this nasdaq proposal  the company would be eligible to obtain an extension throughout and potentially thereafter for its stock price to close above for ten consecutive trading days 
the company s management believes that the combination of cash on hand  cash flows from operations and outside funding will provide sufficient liquidity to meet the company s ongoing cash requirements 
this is based both on the company s historical ability to raise capital and on debt and equity financings currently available to the company 
however  there can be no assurance that the company can or will obtain sufficient funds from operations or from additional financings on terms acceptable to the company 
if the company is unable to obtain sufficient additional financing  it will be required to reduce spending in order to maintain its operations at a reduced level 
management believes that it will be able to reduce spending if required 
however  such reduction would negatively impact progress on implementing the company s business plan  and may require substantial reductions in the purchase commitments previously disclosed herein 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the company s significant contractual obligations as of december  are for lease payments related to a reduction in facilities classified as restructuring in  operating leases primarily for office space and inventory commitments 
the company expects to receive  in sublease income through fiscal  which is equivalent to the adjusted cost of the lease to the company after restructuring charges of  recorded in contractual obligations payments due by periods total restructuring liability operating lease inventory commitments item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
the company does not hold investments or use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
all of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on the company s financial position at december  actual results may differ materially 
foreign currency exchange risk the majority of the company s revenue  expense  and capital purchasing activities are transacted in us dollars 
however  as a result of the company s international manufacturing  research and development  sales and marketing  inventory procurement  and other activities  the company enters into transactions denominated in other currencies  primarily the japanese yen and the european euro or in which the us dollar equivalent is determined by the values of such currencies 
prior to the adoption of the euro  the company also regularly entered into transactions denominated in the german deutsche mark 
as of january   xybernaut gmbh converted its functional currency from the german deutsche mark to the european euro 
the effect of this conversion was an increase of  on beginning accumulated deficit  which is included in the foreign currency translation balance 
historically  the company has not realized significant gains or losses in transactions denominated in  or determined by  foreign currencies 
to date  the company has not entered into foreign exchange forward or option contracts to hedge its exposure to future movements in foreign exchange rates because the company s management believes that the potential impact of these movements does not justify the costs of entering into such contracts or the use of capital to collateralize these contracts 
as international sales and operations increase in the future  the company may enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge transactions denominated in a foreign currency

according to published sources  the average fluctuation of the european euro during and and the german deutsche mark during was  and  respectively  and the average fluctuation of the japanese yen during  and was  and  respectively 
management believes that these fluctuations did not have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial position for  and interest rate sensitivity as discussed in the liquidity and capital resources section  the company has historically entered into debt financings  has entered into a loan agreement in march and continues to explore various new financing alternatives  including debt financing 
if additional funds are raised through borrowings  the company will be subject to additional interest charges and will most likely be required to comply with financial covenants or other restrictions 
interest rate increases may materially increase the company s interest expense  hinder the company s ability to borrow additional funds or have a negative effect on the ability of the company s customers to purchase its products 
required financial covenants may also hinder the company s ability to expand or change its business operations 
to date  the company has not entered into interest rate forward or option contracts to hedge its exposure to future movements in interest rates because the company s management believes that the potential impact of these movements does not justify the costs of entering into such contracts or the use of capital to collateralize these contracts 
as the company s exposure to interest rate fluctuations becomes more significant  it may enter into interest rate forward and option contracts to hedge against such fluctuations 
according to published sources  the average prime interest rate during  and was  and  respectively  or a prime interest rate fluctuation at december compared to the rate at the beginning of the fiscal year in  and of  and  respectively 
management believes that these fluctuations did not have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial position for  and euro conversion on january   certain member countries of the european union established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies and the euro 
the transition period for the introduction of the euro ended june  as of january   xybernaut gmbh converted its functional currency from the german deutsche mark to the european euro 
the effects of this conversion on beginning accumulated deficit was an increase of  which is included in the foreign currency translation balance 
issues that were addressed by the company as a result of the introduction of the euro include the conversion of information technology systems  reassessment of foreign currency exchange risk  negotiation and amendment of existing agreements and contracts  and processing of tax and accounting records 
at december   the company did not experience significant issues with the euro conversion and the conversion did not have a material impact on the company s results of operations or financial position
