overview we provide professional internet data security services and develop and market software and microprocessor based products needed to secure electronic commerce and communications over the internet and other communications networks based on internet protocols 
our primary technology offerings use pki  which is the standard technology for securing internet based commerce and communications 
in addition  pulsar  one of our wholly owned subsidiaries  is an established computer and networking product reseller that focuses on resales to government agencies  large corporate accounts and state and local governments 
we acquired pulsar in june in exchange for  shares of our common stock 
due to the intensive capital requirements and low margin returns  subsequent to december   we decided to exit the pulsar line of business and as a result  we are not accepting new orders and we are currently in the final stages of completing a wind down of the pulsar operations 
before  we were solely a provider of electronic interconnect products to government and commercial entities 
in  we formed our data security division  which is the basis of our operations today 
the data security division was engaged primarily in research and development until  when it began to generate meaningful revenue 
in september  we sold our intercon division  which consisted of the assets relating to our interconnect operations  for cash to allied signal inc  an unrelated publicly traded company 
our lack of liquidity and shortage of working capital has limited our operations 
if we do not raise additional capital within the next several months  we face the prospect of filing for protection to reorganize our debts and financial obligations 
to date  creditors and vendors generally have cooperated with us  which has given us time to reduce our operating expenses and realize increases in revenues in our core business 
we have done both in the last two quarters of our operations 
if we are unable to make payments on the extended term agreements or pay our current vendors  or if holders of our notes declare us in default and call their notes  we would not have the financial resources to satisfy all of these obligations 
the results of our operations and liquidity discussions in this section of this report contain further comments on our limited resources and our dependency on continued creditor cooperation for us to continue our operations 
to meet our existing obligations  we will need to continue improving our sales and continue controlling our operating expenses 
we will also require time to realize the financial benefits of improved operating results together with the continued cooperation of our creditors 
we are in discussions with several financing sources regarding additional capital and have executed a term sheet for a minimum financing of million that would have a dilutive effect 
however  the investors may fail to provide the financing or may wish to change the terms  called for in the term sheet 
there is no assurance that the investors will close the transaction  or if the transaction does close  that it will be on the terms outlined in the executed term sheet 
if this proposed transaction does not close  we will seek other sources of funding  explore the sale of product lines or intellectual property rights  or evaluate merger partners 
we may be forced to sell company assets or merge at a price below what we might otherwise realize 
we are at a critical juncture for the continued survival of our company 
critical accounting policies this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section of this report discusses our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
we based our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies  see the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this report 
revenue recognition some of our data security hardware products contain embedded software  the sale of which is incidental to the hardware product sale 
data security license revenue is recognized upon delivery if an executed license exists  a delivery as defined under the license has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable  and collection is probable 
prior to  post contract customer support revenue was not separately identified and priced 
therefore  sufficient vendor specific objective evidence could not be established for the value or cost of such services 
furthermore  prior to  revenue for the entire license  including bundled post contract customer support was recognized ratably over the life of the license 
commencing in  software delivered under a license requires a separate annual maintenance contract that governs the conditions of post contract customer support 
post contract customer support services can be purchased under a separate contract on the same terms and at the same pricing  whether purchased at the time of sale or at a later date 
revenue from these separate maintenance support contracts is recognized ratably over the maintenance period 
revenue from cost plus award fee support and development contracts is recognized on the basis of hours incurred plus other reimbursable contract costs incurred during the period 
prior to  any award fee earned under a cost plus award fee contract was not recognized until the award fee notice was received 
beginning in  for a cost plus award fee support contract  we exercised the contract clause to bill and collect one half of the award fee ratably over the term of the contract 
revenue is recognized concurrently with billings based on the performance of the contract requirements and reasonable assurance of collection 
based upon historical results  we have received final awards in excess of one half of the full award fees 
a post contract period performance review conducted by the customer determines the remaining amount of the award fee to be received  which amount is then recognized as earned revenue  together with interest paid on the unpaid balance 
award fees under development contracts are recognized when confirmed by the customer 
revenue from network deployment products is recognized upon transfer of title  generally upon verification of delivery to the customer  which represents evidence delivery has occurred  under a sales order represented by a government purchase order that contains a fixed purchase price 
when we fulfill the elements of the government purchase order  collection of the revenue recorded is reasonably assured 
product and service revenues from our electric security systems contracts were recognized in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
we recognized this revenue on a percentage of completion method  based on estimated labor dollars incurred 
the electric security systems product line was discontinued in the year ended december  the company s revenue recognition policies are in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make payments for services 
we analyze accounts receivable  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets we assess the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
the net carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets not recoverable is reduced to fair value 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined that certain identifiable technology and developed technology acquired in connection with the biz acquisition were no longer going to be pursued 
additionally  we anticipated a delay or indefinite reduction in projected revenues from the biz acquisition 
accordingly  we performed an impairment analysis 
as a result of that analysis  we recorded an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of related to the unamortized balances of million in identifiable technology  million in developed technology and million in goodwill acquired in connection with the biz acquisition 
after this impairment charge  goodwill in the amount of million is the only remaining intangible asset relative to the biz acquisition 
subsequent to december   we decided to exit the pulsar line of business 
as our projections indicated inadequate cash flows from operations  we recorded an impairment charge of  relative to pulsar intangible assets  which represented the remaining balance of the intangible assets 
results of operations comparison of years ended december   and we acquired biz in august our results of operations for and include the results of biz s operations since august  therefore  revenue and expenses are not comparable from period to period 
total revenues total revenues decreased from million during the year ended december  to million during the year ended december   and decreased from million during to million during the year ended december  the decrease from to consisted of a million decrease in network solutions market revenues primarily because of our inability to accept and fulfill a large number of customer orders due to reduced accounts receivable financing availability 
our primary vendors were unwilling to sell additional product to us on open account because of significant past due amounts for goods we had previously purchased from them 
the decrease was offset by an  increase in data security products and services revenues primarily attributable to an increase in sales volume of existing data security products and services 
the decrease from to consisted of a million decrease in network solutions market revenues that was partially offset by a million increase in information security products and services market revenues 
due to the lack of working capital  we began to limit the acceptance of orders within our pulsar operations  the source of the network solutions market revenues  during the fourth quarter of while we were evaluating various options with respect to the pulsar operations 
as of march   we had effectively terminated all remaining employees at pulsar and shut down pulsar s operations 
our continued focus on our core business of information security products and services resulted in an increase of million in license and service revenue from to and an increase in data security products revenue of  from to we expect continued increases in revenues from our core business of information security products and services in at a rate comparable to the increases in core business revenues experienced in we anticipate such an increase based on signed development contracts and pending contracts that we are currently negotiating  coupled with expected increases in data security product revenues as we concentrate all of our sales and marketing efforts in this area 
we do not expect any significant revenues from the network solutions market segment in during  of total revenues was generated from sales to the united states immigration and naturalization service 
during  of revenue was generated from sales to the united states immigration and naturalization service 
during  and of total revenues was generated from sales to general dynamics and micron pc  llc  respectively 
sales to federal government agencies accounted for approximately  and of total revenues during  and  respectively 
product revenues product revenues decreased from million during to million during  and decreased from million during to million during the decrease from to consisted of a million decrease in network deployment products revenues that was partially offset by a  increase in data security products revenues 
the decrease from to consisted of a million decrease in network solutions market revenues that was partially offset by a  increase in data security products revenues 
we do not expect any significant network deployment revenues in as noted above  we do expect continued increases in data security products revenues 
license and service revenues license and service revenues decreased from million during to million during  and increased from million during to million during the decrease from to was primarily attributable to a  decrease in electric security systems revenues 
the electric security systems product line was discontinued in july  and we did not recognize any revenues for that product line during the increase from to was primarily attributable to a million increase in revenues associated with a higher margin subcontract with general dynamics to develop the architecture for the next generation pki and related extension initiatives for the dod  combined with a  increase in software sales and support services 
we expect license and service revenues to increase in as a result of signed and pending contracts noted above 
product gross margin product gross margin decreased as a percentage of net product revenues from during to during  and increased from during to during the decrease from to was primarily attributable to a reduction in margins related to network deployment products  which reduction resulted from our having to pay higher prices for product from secondary suppliers because our primary vendors were unwilling to sell to us on open account 
during  network deployment products represented of total product revenues as compared to data security products that represented of total product revenues 
during  network deployment products represented of total product revenues as compared to data security products that represented of total product revenues 
margins from the sale of data security products are significantly greater than the margins from the sale of network deployment products 
in addition  data security products margins also decreased  mainly due to a significant reduction in the average selling price of our netsign r reader due to competitive pricing pressures 
the increase from to was primarily attributable to the overall reduction in revenues from our network solutions market business  for which the margins are significantly lower than margins from the information security products and services business segment 
during  network solutions market business represented only of total product revenues compared to data security products that represented total of product revenues 
we expect product gross margin to increase in  as we expect no network deployment product revenues in as previously stated  margins from network deployment product revenues are substantially lower than margins derived from our core business of data security product revenues 
license and service gross margin license and service gross margin increased as a percentage of license and service revenues from during to during  and increased from during to during the increase from to was primarily attributable to new contracts that were entered into in that resulted in additional revenues of million associated with higher margin software licenses and services related to our subcontract with general dynamics 
we expect license and service gross margins to decrease somewhat in due to a potential change in the mix of license and services 
we expect more significant increases in service revenues  for which margins are typically lower than margins derived from licensing revenues 
we also expect that certain compensation costs that were formally considered research and development expense  will be included as cost of sales in due to a development contract that we are currently engaged in 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million during to million during  and decreased from to million during the increase from to was primarily attributable to the addition of approximately million of personnel expenses associated with the biz acquisition and a net loss on a lease for new operating facilities of approximately million  which were partially offset by a reduction in compensation expense of approximately  and other net reductions totaling approximately million 
the net loss on a lease was the result of a lease we had entered into in october with a former related party for new operating facilities 
after entering into the lease  we determined that we would not need all of the space contracted for and therefore we recorded a loss on the lease net of estimated sublease income 
compensation expense reductions included  related to pulsar  which were primarily for reductions in salary and commission expenses due to decreased revenues and the need to adjust cost structures accordingly 
reductions not related to pulsar were primarily attributable to reductions in salary  travel  professional fees  printing and office expenses 
expense reductions not related to pulsar were done in an effort to reduce current cash expenditures 
the decrease from to was primarily attributable to the gain recorded in the approximate amount of  as a result of the completion of the restructuring of the lease obligations  for which an accrual of million was recorded in as discussed above 
the net result was a reduction of million in versus we also implemented staff reductions  reduced compensation levels and initiated a wind down of the pulsar operations in  which further reduced overall staffing 
as a result  compensation and benefits expense decreased by approximately  in from additionally  sales promotion expenses decreased by approximately  while other net reductions totaling approximately  were offset by an increase in professional fees of approximately  in versus as a percentage of total revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses increased from during to during and increased to during the percentage increase for each of the years was primarily attributable to the significant decrease in revenues related to network deployment products 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to decrease as a percentage of total revenue in due to expected increases in overall revenue combined with decreases in selling  general and administrative expenses associated with the cessation of our pulsar operations 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased from million during to million during  and decreased from million during to million during the increase from to was primarily attributable to significant increased staffing related to product development  including development efforts related to the fortetm microprocessor  maestro  pm  netsign r and token reader writers  coupled with the addition of personnel expense from the biz acquisition 
the decrease from to was primarily attributable to significant reductions in staffing 
as a percentage of total revenues  expenses increased from during to during  and increased from during to during the percentage increase from to was primarily attributable to the continued expansion of our research and development efforts  combined with the significant decrease in network deployment revenues 
the percentage increase from to was primarily attributable to the significant decrease in network deployment revenues 
we expect research and development expenses to decrease in as expenses that were formerly considered research and development  will be included within cost of sales for due to current development contracts that we will be engaged in during research and development wave systems corp 
in october  biz signed a development agreement with wave systems corp 
wave for the integration of embassy based systems with set top box master reference designs of broadcom corporation 
the development agreement was amended in may under this agreement  as amended  we were required to pay a total of million beginning june  through december  in january  we provided written notice to suspend the work under the agreement along with the related billings 
we executed a settlement agreement with wave through which we terminated the development agreement effective as of august  and reached settlement terms 
according to the terms of the settlement agreement  in october we issued million shares of common stock and a  non interest bearing note convertible into  shares of our common stock 
as a result of this settlement agreement  for the year ended december   we recorded a loss of approximately million 
we do not expect any further research and development wave expenses in impairment of goodwill and other intangibles in june  we acquired pulsar 
all of the outstanding shares of pulsar were exchanged for  shares of our common stock 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
in the fourth quarter of  we determined the integration of pulsar would not be completed as planned and that the anticipated operating synergies would not be realized 
as a result  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  we analyzed the recoverability of the goodwill and other intangibles relating to the acquisition of pulsar 
we performed an assessment of the recoverability of the remaining goodwill and other intangible assets 
in the fourth quarter of  based on the results of our assessment and valuation  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to unamortized intangible assets acquired in the purchase of pulsar 
based on our assessment and valuation  we believed that after the impairment charge of million  no further impairment existed at december  as of december   the remaining unamortized intangible assets of  acquired in the purchase of pulsar was to be amortized over the remainder of their year life 
due to the intensive capital requirements and low margin returns  subsequent to december   we decided to exit this line of business and as a result  we are not accepting new orders and we are currently in the final stages of completing a wind down of the pulsar operations 
as our projections indicated inadequate cash flows from operations  we recorded an impairment charge of  relative to pulsar intangibles  which represented the remaining balance of the intangible assets 
in august  we acquired biz 
all of the outstanding shares of biz were exchanged for  shares of our common stock 
the biz acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
as part of the biz acquisition  we acquired million of identifiable intangible assets 
in the fourth quarter of  we determined that the other intangible assets and a portion of goodwill related to the biz acquisition would not be realized 
as a result  we analyzed the recoverability of the intangible assets relating to the biz acquisition 
based on the results of our analysis  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to unamortized identifiable intangible assets and goodwill acquired in the biz acquisition 
based on our analysis  we believe that after the impairment charge of million  no further impairment existed at december  the remaining identifiable intangible asset acquired in the acquisition of biz is million of goodwill that  in accordance with sfas no 
 will no longer be amortized but rather will be tested at least annually for impairment 
acquired in process research and development during the year ended december   we recorded in process research and development ipr d charges of million related to the biz acquisition 
the portion of the purchase price allocated to ipr d for the biz acquisition was approximately of the total purchase price of million 
an independent third party investment banking firm was retained to estimate the fair value of purchased ipr d 
at the biz acquisition date  biz was in the process of developing technology that would deliver security features to customers  and developing a new platform for delivering its product 
the ipr d had not yet reached technological feasibility  had no alternative uses  and may not have achieved commercial viability 
at the valuation date  the new technology had not reached a completed prototype stage  although some beta testing on portions of the technology had begun 
at the valuation date  the ipr d ranged between and complete  based on costs incurred on the ipr d through the biz acquisition date as compared to the total costs estimated to complete the project 
the ipr d project was valued using the income forecast method 
this method took into consideration earnings remaining after deducting from cash flows related to the in process technology  the market rates of return on contributory assets  including assembled workforce  merchant agreements  working capital and fixed assets 
the cash flows were then discounted to present value at an appropriate rate 
the discount rate was determined by an analysis of the risks associated with each of the identified intangible assets 
the resulting net cash flows to which discount rates of to were applied were based on management s estimates of revenues  operating expenses and income taxes from such acquired in process technology 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles amortization expense decreased from million during to  during  and decreased from  during to  during the decrease from to was primarily attributable to the reduction of goodwill and other intangibles that resulted from the million impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of amortization expense in was comprised of  related to pulsar intangibles and  related to biz identifiable intangible assets 
because we adopted statement fas no 
effective january   amortization expense in was related solely to pulsar intangibles 
as of december   we wrote off the remaining  intangible asset balance related to pulsar 
due to the adoption of statement fas no 
 no amortization is expected in realized loss on trading securities our realized loss on trading securities in and related to our position in wave 
the reduction from to was primarily attributable to our declining position in wave 
we do not expect significant realized losses on trading securities in  due to our current small position in wave 
as of december   the market value of the common stock held in wave approximated  interest expense  net interest expense  net increased from  during to  during and increased from  during to  during the increase from to was primarily attributable to a decrease in interest income of  a decrease in interest expense associated with accounts receivable financing of  and an increase in interest expense associated with vendor term outs and notes of  the increase from to was primarily attributable to a decrease in interest income of  a decrease in interest expense associated with accounts receivable financing of  an increase in interest expense of  associated with vendor term outs due to the successful negotiation with certain vendors to extend the payment of accounts payable over longer terms  and an increase in accrued interest on notes payable of  due to increased borrowing 
we expect further increases in interest expense in due to our need for increased borrowings 
non cash interest and financing expense non cash interest and financing expense in was related to the convertible secured promissory notes issued on april  there was no non cash interest and financing expense in or the non cash charges represent amortization of the relative fair value of warrants issued in connection with the debt instruments in addition to the beneficial conversion features of debt issued in  which has been recorded as a discount relative to the debt instrument  and the amortization of the value of warrants issued with the debt instruments 
we expect continued non cash interest and financing expense in related to the warrants and beneficial conversion features of the debt issued in  unless such debt is converted into equity 
further  we may issue additional warrants in connection with future capital raises 
loss from equity investee in january  we formed ssp gaming to conduct all business and any required financing activities relative to the gaming industry 
in june  ssp gaming and the venetian executed an operating agreement to form venetian interactive 
the purpose of venetian interactive is to provide management services  consulting services  financial services  intellectual property licensing services  and equipment to the online gaming industry in venues where such activity complies with all regulatory requirements  and to develop and operate venetian branded casino sites 
in the year ended december   ssp gaming recorded  as loss from equity investee  which represents its pro rata portion of the venetian interactive net loss 
we expect a larger loss from our equity investee in  as the venture continues in its development stage 
other income expense  net other income expense  net  in was related to a one time non operating credit in the amount of  there was no other income expense  net in other income expense  net in was  which consisted of gains resulting from settlements with vendors in the amount of   in expenses associated with the unoccupied spectrum building   in income related to revisions of estimated liabilities  a  note discount associated with the repayment of a note from our co chairman and  write off of interest receivable associated with the same note 
we cannot predict other income expense for  although we do believe we may record additional gains as a result of further settlements with vendors 
income taxes for  the income tax expense of  was primarily attributable to minimum california franchise taxes 
for  the income tax expense of  was attributable to the reversal of previously recognized tax credits because it was determined that they would not be realized 
for  the income tax of  represents the minimum required amount for state franchise taxes 
we do not expect any substantial changes to income tax expense in backlog at december   and  total backlog was million  million and million  respectively 
orders are subject to cancellation in certain circumstances  and backlog may therefore not be indicative of future operating results 
the backlog at december   was made up of  related to data security products and  related to network deployment products 
the  related to network deployment products was caused by our inability to obtain product from our vendors to fulfill customer orders 
during  we stopped accepting orders within our pulsar operations  which were the sole source of network deployment product revenues 
as of december   the backlog was made up of million related to licenses and services and  related to data security products 
the license and service backlog primarily consisted of  related to our fortezza r support contract and  related to our subcontract with general dynamics 
recent accounting pronouncements in april  the fasb issued statement  rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
and technical corrections 
statement rescinds statement  which required all gains and losses from extinguishment of debt to be aggregated and  if material  classified as an extraordinary item  net of related income tax effect 
in addition  statement amends statement on leasing to require that certain lease modifications that have economic effects similar to sale leaseback transactions be accounted for in the same manner as sale leaseback transactions 
provisions of statement related to the rescission of statement are effective for financial statements issued by the company after january  the provisions of the statement related to sale leaseback transactions were effective for any transactions occurring after may  all other provisions of the statement were effective as of the end of the second quarter of the changes required by statement are not expected to have a material impact on the results of operations  financial position or liquidity of the company 
in july  the fasb issued statement  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
statement requires companies to recognize costs associated with the exit or disposal of activities as they are incurred rather than at the date a plan of disposal or commitment to exit is initiated 
types of costs covered by statement include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring  discontinued operation  facility closing  or other exit or disposal activity 
statement will apply to all exit or disposal activities initiated after december  at this time  the company does not expect the adoption of the provisions of statement to have a material impact on the company s financial results 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
interpretation  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
interpretation requires certain guarantees to be recorded at fair value 
in general  interpretation applies to contracts or indemnification agreements that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying that is related to an asset  liability  or an equity security of the guaranteed party 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  interpretation also requires new disclosures  even when the likelihood of making any payments under the guarantee is remote 
these disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  the changes required by interpretation are not expected to have a material impact on the results of operations  financial position or liquidity of the company 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
interpretation addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities which have one or both of the following characteristics the equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional support from other parties  which is provided through other interests that will absorb some or all of the expected losses of the entity  the equity investors lack one or more of the following essential characteristics of a controlling financial interest a the direct or indirect ability to make decisions about the entity s activities through voting rights or similar rights  b the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity if they occur  which makes it possible for the entity to finance its activities  or c the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity if they occur  which is the compensation for the risk of absorbing expected losses 
interpretation does not require consolidation by transferors to qualifying special purpose entities 
interpretation applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
it applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  the company is currently assessing the impact of interpretation the company has  however  identified one entity that may be required to be consolidated beginning in the third quarter of see note to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   the company recorded a net investment in other assets on its balance sheet of approximately associated with these investments 
the company currently adjusts the carrying value of these investments for any losses incurred by the entity through earnings 
while this entity may be considered a variable interest entity  the company has not yet determined if it will need to be consolidated 
in june  the fasb issued statement  accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
the standard applies to legal obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or normal use of the asset 
statement requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the fair value of the liability is added to the carrying value of the associated asset  and this additional carrying amount is depreciated over the life of the asset 
the liability is accreted at the end of each period through charges to operating expense 
if the obligation is settled for other than the carrying amount of the liability  the company will recognize a gain or loss on settlement 
as required  the company adopted the provisions of statement for the quarter ended march  management does not believe adoption of this standard will have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets effective january  pursuant to sfas no 
 goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized  but must now be tested for impairment at least annually 
we have performed both the transitional impairment test and the first annual impairment test required by sfas no 
using certain valuation techniques  and have determined that with the exception of the pulsar write off as previously discussed  no impairment exists at december  to goodwill and other intangible asset balances 
changes in assumptions and estimates included within the analysis could result in significantly different results than those identified above and those recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
it is possible  but not predictable  that a change in our business  market capitalization  operating results  financing or other factors could affect the carrying value of goodwill or other intangible assets and cause an impairment write off in the future 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had a working capital deficit of million 
we incurred a net loss of million for the twelve months then ended 
we expect to continue to incur additional losses in the current year 
given our december  cash balance of  and the projected operating cash requirements  we anticipate that existing capital resources will not be adequate to satisfy cash flow requirements through december  we will require additional funding 
our cash flow estimates are based upon achieving certain levels of sales  reductions in operating expenses  liquidity available under the accounts receivable financing  as well as additional debt or equity financing 
should sales be less than forecast  expenses be higher than forecast or the liquidity not be available under the accounts receivable financing or through additional financings of debt and or equity  we will not have adequate resources to fund our operations 
we have executed a term sheet for a minimum investment of million 
however  the closing of that transaction is contingent upon certain conditions 
there is no assurance that the investors will close the transaction  or if the transaction does close that it will be on the terms outlined in the executed term sheet 
if this proposed transaction does not close  we will seek other sources of funding  explore the sale of product lines or intellectual property rights  or evaluate merger partners 
during the past year  we incurred defaults under both our accounts receivable financing with wells fargo business credit  inc and the long term convertible notes 
we have requested waivers from the holders of the notes  but such waivers have not yet been granted 
this means the noteholders have the right to declare us in default and call all of their debt due and immediately payable 
with the potential of the notes being called for payment  we re classified what would have otherwise been long term debt as short term debt in the consolidated balance sheet as of december  in october  we executed a new factoring agreement with bay view funding bvf 
the agreement states among other things that a default occurs if we are generally not paying debts as they become due or if we are left with unreasonably small capital 
we have notified bvf of our failure to make certain payments on a timely basis and have therefore recently requested a waiver of such default 
cash used in operations for the twelve months ended december  was million compared to cash used in operations during the twelve months ended december  of million 
the increase in cash used in operations was primarily attributable to a larger reduction of accrued liabilities and accounts payable 
the increased uses of cash were partially offset by larger reductions of accounts receivable and prepaid expenses 
at december  the balance in accounts receivable was million and the balance in accounts payable was million  of which approximately million has aged days or more 
as of december    in accounts receivable was factored under our arrangement with bvf 
as a result  significant reductions in accounts receivable will not be available to provide us with cash to meet our future cash needs and we will need to continue using cash to reduce accounts payable 
we expect to continue to use cash in operations due to existing current liabilities that will need to be paid in cash provided by investing activities for the twelve months ended december  was  compared to cash provided by investing activities during the twelve months ended december  of  the increase in cash provided by investing activities was attributable to proceeds from the sale of trading securities of million 
the market value of trading securities held at december  is approximately  we anticipate that these trading securities will all be sold prior to december  and will no longer be available to provide us with additional cash to meet our future cash needs 
we do not expect any significant increases or decreases from cash provided by or used in investing activities in cash provided by financing activities for the twelve months ended december  was million compared to cash provided by financing activities during the twelve months ended december  of million 
the increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to the increase in proceeds from the issuance of convertible debt 
we expect to have increases in cash provided by financing activities in due to our need for additional working capital 
as of december   the balance of trading securities decreased from million from december  to  as a result of selling of approximately million of wave common shares  and recognizing approximately  loss from sales and changes in the value of securities held 
as of december   accounts receivable totaled million as compared to million as of december  this decrease was mainly attributable to the decreased revenues of the network deployment segment of the business 
the decrease was a source of cash in the amount of million 
as of december   accounts payable decreased from million to million as of december  this accounts payable decrease was mainly attributable to the decreased purchase of goods for re sale by our network deployment business segment and used cash in the amount of million 
the remainder of the reduction in accounts payable was attributable to approximately  of gains on settling vendor accounts  and issuance of  of notes in settlement of vendor accounts 
as compared to december   accrued liabilities decreased from million to million as of december  this decrease in accrued liabilities was mainly attributable to the elimination of million accrued under the wave development contract  elimination of an estimated  liability to a certain vendor  and approximately  reduction of accrued personnel costs due to a reduction in workforce 
as of december   the prior year balance of accrued rent in the amount of million was eliminated in a settlement relative to facilities leases 
we anticipate the trend of lower accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued liabilities to continue until sales increase and the increased operations require an expanded workforce 
we have experienced net losses and negative cash flows from operations for the last several years  and as of december   had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have financed our past operations principally through the issuance of common stock in a public offering and the issuance of convertible debt 
the net proceeds from our public offering were approximately million 
the proceeds from the issuance of convertible debt for the year ended december  were million 
we raised  through the issuance of secured promissory notes dated november  we raised million through the issuance of secured convertible promissory notes in january and march we have also issued notes and common stock to settle or restructure previously executed agreements 
on july   chase manhattan bank chase advanced to our co chairman  mr 
winkler  million that mr 
winkler advanced to biz for the re purchase of preferred stock held by an investor in biz 
mr 
winkler executed a million demand note with chase and biz executed a million demand note due september  with jaw financial  jaw jaw  an entity controlled by mr 
winkler 
the demand note contained an interest charge of prime plus through the maturity date and prime plus after the maturity date 
on october   we made a principal payment of  paid accrued interest  and executed a new promissory note to jaw for  the terms of the promissory note call for interest of prime plus payable monthly  together with five monthly payments of principal in the amount of  and one final payment on april  in the amount of  the promissory note provided chase a security interest in the shares in wave owned by us and  subject to chase s loan security guidelines  including the rights to proceeds from any sales of those shares 
the loan was paid in full on march   ahead of the scheduled maturity 
in december  our co chairmen each purchased a  three year note bearing interest at per annum in a million private placement of such notes 
in connection with the issuance of these notes we incurred approximately  of issuance costs primarily consisting of legal and other professional fees  which were to be paid upon completion of the april  financing described below 
on april   we closed a financing whereby  with the exception of mr 
winkler and mr 
shah  the noteholders exchanged their december notes for secured convertible promissory notes convertible at per share  with detachable warrants 
we issued a total of  warrants in the offering 
in june mr 
shah and mr 
winkler exchanged their december notes together with accrued interest for  and  shares  respectively  of our common stock based upon an exchange price of per common share  which represented a premium above the trading price of our common stock 
on april   we raised million through the issuance of million in secured convertible promissory notes   in unsecured non convertible promissory notes  held by co chairman mr 
shah and  held by co chairman mr 
winkler and the receipt of pre payment of a  note due from mr 
shah  less a discount of  the discount was based upon a present value using the rate of for early payment and was charged against earnings in the current year 
in connection with the issuance of the secured convertible promissory notes we incurred approximately  of issuance costs  which primarily consisted of amortization of warrant costs  investment banker fees  legal and other professional fees 
all promissory notes mature december   bear interest at a rate of per annum to be paid quarterly in cash  or at our discretion  in common shares based upon the trailing day average price per share prior to the interest due date  and the million secured convertible promissory notes are convertible  in whole or in part  at the option of the holder into an aggregate of approximately million shares of our common stock at any time prior to maturity  at a conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment under certain conditions  and the secured convertible promissory notes have detachable warrants exercisable for three years to purchase up to an additional million shares at per share 
in conjunction with the april closing of the secured convertible promissory notes  million principal and  of accrued interest of the december notes were exchanged for the secured convertible promissory notes and detachable warrants to purchase million shares at per share 
the secured convertible promissory notes automatically convert prior to maturity if our common shares trade at or above per share with average volume of  shares per day for consecutive trading days 
we are subject to restrictive covenants related to the secured convertible and unsecured non convertible promissory notes that prevent us from pledging intellectual property as collateral 
in june mr 
shah and mr 
winkler exchanged their unsecured non convertible promissory notes together with accrued interest for  and  shares  respectively  of our common stock based upon an agreed upon price of per common share 
over the past three years  we have spent substantial sums on r d activities 
during that time period  we incurred substantial losses from continuing operations 
while we believe the r d expenditures created significant future revenue producing opportunities  some of the related products are just entering production 
we are currently involved in sales pursuits relative to these products that  if successful  will generate significant revenues 
however  unless we receive orders for these new products and receive significant financing  we can no longer support the current level of r d activity 
while we have reduced our staffing levels  if sales fail to materialize  we will need to further reduce expenses through additional reductions in staff 
the combination of reduced accounts receivable financing availability and the unwillingness of primary vendors of our network deployment business to sell additional product to us on open account because of significant past due amounts caused a substantial reduction in the sales and related cost of sales during the year ended december   which in turn reduced cash flow 
the reduced cash flow impaired our ability to meet vendor commitments as they became due 
due to the intensive capital requirements and low margin returns  subsequent to december   we decided to exit the pulsar line of business and as a result  we are not accepting new orders and we are currently in the final stages of completing a wind down of the pulsar operations 
in october  biz signed a development agreement with wave for the integration of embassy based systems with set top box master reference designs of broadcom corporation 
the development agreement was amended in may under this agreement  as amended  we were required to pay a total of million beginning june  through december  in january  we provided written notice to suspend the work under the agreement along with the related billings 
we executed a settlement agreement effective as of september  with wave whereby we concluded the development agreement effective as of august  and reached settlement terms 
according to the terms of the termination and mutual release agreement  in october we issued million shares of common stock and a  non interest bearing note convertible into  shares of our common stock 
as a result of this settlement agreement  during the year ended december   we recorded a loss of approximately million 
additionally  based on the settlement agreement  we eliminated the related million in total liabilities from the balance sheet 
in november  we executed an alliance agreement with eds for the marketing of our products to eds customers 
this alliance calls for a joint working relationship between the two companies  is non exclusive and has a term of ten years 
on august   eds and we executed a letter of intent and temporary working agreement whereby eds supplied software and hardware for re sale to pulsar customers 
under this agreement  as of december   million remained outstanding and unpaid to eds for purchases of hardware and software 
eds and we executed a master services agreement dated as of november  msa whereby beginning december  and ending december   we and eds established a strategic teaming relationship to implement  sell and deliver a set of secure transaction processing offerings based upon a trust assurance network tan 
the msa task order requires that we pay a monthly fee of  for account  test and lab management services beginning january  the obligations for these services can be terminated beginning january  by giving days prior written notice and payment of  or beginning january  by giving days prior written notice and payment of  further  the msa task order provides for eds to provide tan hosting and implementation in exchange for an implementation fee of  payable october  once installation of the production environment tan is complete  eds agrees to host the tan in exchange for a monthly service fee of  for months and  per month for the remaining months of the msa 
we may terminate the msa task order without cause by paying  after january  and providing days prior written notice 
during  we arranged for the lease of two buildings approximating  square feet that were under construction and were subsequently completed in the spectrum area of irvine  california from an entity that was partially owned by our chairman  mr 
shah 
on one building totaling approximately  square feet  we sublet one half of the building on terms and conditions matching the underlying lease 
the sublease was with a related party company owned by our co chairman  mr 
winkler 
while that company made a lease deposit  it did not make any monthly rent payments 
in october  we restructured our lease obligations with our landlord  research venture  llc  for the two buildings 
this restructuring and settlement revised the estimate of anticipated costs relative to the disposition of one of the buildings that was recorded in in the amount of million  which was net of anticipated offsetting sublease income 
as a result of the restructuring and settlement  we increased stockholders equity by million through the issuance of common stock valued for financial reporting purposes at  and recorded a gain of  for the year ended december  the settlement required us to issue  shares of common stock  pay  in cash over a one year period  cancel the lease on one building approximating  square feet  and take occupancy of the other building under a seven year operating lease for the facility with approximately  square feet for an initial monthly rental rate of  plus common area costs beginning in december the monthly rental rate on the seven year lease is scheduled to increase to  plus common area costs  at the beginning of the third year 
we record rent expense on a straight line basis 
at our option  a portion of the rental rate may be paid either in stock or in cash during the first two years of the lease under certain circumstances through conversion of a  subordinated convertible promissory note that we issued as prepaid rent 
in august  mr 
shah surrendered his ownership interest in the entity that owns the two buildings 
at the time of surrendering his interest  the buildings were encumbered by one or more construction loans for which the lender required personal guarantees for renewal of the financing 
as there was little  if any  equity in the project and mr 
shah was unwilling to personally guarantee the loans  mr 
shah chose to surrender his membership interest 
in october  we terminated our accounts receivable financing arrangement with wells fargo business credit  inc and entered into a factoring agreement with bay view funding bvf 
the new factoring agreement contains a maximum advance of  was for an initial term of three months  and automatically renews for successive three month periods 
we may terminate this agreement at any time without the payment of any early termination fees  provided that we give at least thirty days written notice to bvf prior to the end of any renewal term 
the agreement contains a factoring fee  which is based on of the gross face value of the purchased receivable for every day period from the date of purchase by bvf until the invoice is paid in full 
for invoices outstanding more than the day period  a finance fee will be charged at the rate of 
of the gross face value of the purchased receivable for every one day period beyond the th day from the original date of purchase 
at the time of purchase  terms call for bvf to advance of the gross receivable  with the balance remitted after collection of the invoice less the factoring and finance fee  if applicable 
the agreement contains representations  warranties  and covenants and requires a monthly minimum fee  including the factoring and financing fees  of 
of the maximum advance of  or approximately  per month 
the agreement states among other things that a default occurs if we are generally not paying debts as they become due or if we are left with unreasonably small capital 
we have notified bvf of our failure to make certain payments on a timely basis and have therefore recently requested a waiver of such default  but have not yet received such a waiver  and thus remain in default 
our significant fixed commitments with respect to leases and inventory purchases as of december  were as follows payments for the year ended december  total after contractual obligations convertible notes term debt    operating leases      unconditional purchase obligations   total contractual cash obligations      we currently have a need for a substantial amount of capital to meet our liquidity requirements 
the amount of capital that we will need in the future will depend on many factors including  but not limited  to o the ability to extend terms of payment to vendors  o the market acceptance of our products and services  o the levels of promotion and advertising that will be required to launch new products and services and attain a competitive position in the market place  o research and development plans  o levels of inventory and accounts receivable  o technological advances  o competitors responses to our products and services  o relationships with partners  suppliers and customers  o projected capital expenditures  o national and international economic conditions  and events  o periodic analysis of our goodwill valuation that may require us to take additional write downs in future periods  o defaults on financing that will impact the availability of borrowings  or result in notes being declared immediately due and payable  and o reductions in the valuation of investment in trading securities 
our current financial condition is the result of several factors including the following o our operating results were below expectations  o sales of products into the commercial markets are taking longer to develop than originally anticipated  o lower than expected margins and reduced revenues from our pulsar subsidiary ultimately led us to limit sales orders  and o continued research and development expenses due to further enhancement of our products 
in addition to our current deficit working capital situation  current operating plans show a shortfall of cash for the remainder of we intend to mitigate our position through one or more of the following o additional equity capital 
we will seek additional equity capital  if available 
equity capital will most likely be issued at a discount to market and will require the issuance of warrants  which will cause dilution to current stockholders 
in addition  providers of new equity capital may require additional concessions 
o additional convertible debt 
depending upon the market conditions  we may issue additional debt instruments 
the types of instruments available in the market would likely contain a provision for the issuance of warrants and may also be convertible into equity 
o off balance sheet financing 
if we need to add equipment or decide to expand our facilities  we may use an operating lease transaction to acquire the use of capital assets 
an operating lease would not appear on our balance sheet and would be charged as an expense as payments accrue 
o financing of receivables 
we plan to generate cash by financing receivables under with the new bvf agreement 
o sale of investments 
we may sell investments to generate cash 
the market value of trading securities was  at december  since that date  we have not generated any funds through sale of investment securities 
o negotiate with vendors 
we have executed settlement and or term out agreements with a number of vendors 
we will continue to negotiate with vendors regarding payment of existing accounts payable over extended terms of up to months 
o deferral of cash payments 
we may defer cash payments through suspension of certain development projects 
o issuance of stock as payment for existing and future obligations 
we may pay portions of accounts payable and accrued liabilities through issuances of common stock 
o issuance of stock to pay interest 
during  we issued  shares and  shares as payment of interest due on our april  secured convertible promissory notes for the three months ended june  and september   respectively 
during the quarter ended march   we issued  as payment for interest due for the three months ended december  we may issue additional stock in the future to pay interest on long term debt 
o reductions in work force 
we reduced our work force in and decreased the cash compensation paid to the remaining workforce 
we may be forced to make similar reductions in the future if we do not realize our projected sales plans 
if we do not receive adequate financing  we could be forced to merge with another company or cease operations 
while we have a history of selling products in government markets  our new products that are just entering production after years of development have no sales history 
additionally  we are entering commercial markets with our products and are still developing acceptance of our offerings 
considerable uncertainty currently exists with respect to the adequacy of current funds to support our activities beyond december  this uncertainty will continue until a positive cash flow from operations is achieved 
additionally  we are uncertain as to the availability of financing from other sources to fund any cash deficiencies 
in order to reduce this uncertainty  we continue to evaluate additional financing options and may therefore elect to raise capital  from time to time  through equity or debt financings in order to capitalize on business opportunities and market conditions and to insure the continued marketing of current product offerings together with development of new technology  products and services 
there can be no assurance that we can raise additional financing in the future 
based upon forecasted sales and expense levels  we currently anticipate that existing cash  cash equivalents  investments  term out arrangements with vendors and the current availability under our bvf factoring agreement will not be sufficient to satisfy our contemplated cash requirements for the next twelve months 
however  our forecast is based upon certain assumptions  which may differ from actual future outcomes 
we have incurred defaults under our financing agreements in the past 
the bvf agreement states among other things that a default occurs if we are generally not paying debts as they become due or if we are left with unreasonably small capital 
we have notified bvf of our failure to make certain payments on a timely basis and have therefore recently requested a waiver of such default 
we therefore may not be able to draw funds in the future  which would affect our ability to fund our operations 
additionally  without a substantial increase in sales or a reduction in expenses  we will continue to incur operating losses 
risk factors an investment in shares of our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
in addition to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this report  you should carefully consider the following risk factors before deciding to invest or maintain an investment in shares of our common stock 
this report contains or incorporates by reference forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth in the following risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  it is likely that our business  financial condition and operating results would be harmed 
as a result  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you could lose part or all of your investment 
we have a history of losses and may incur future losses that may adversely impact our business and our stockholders by  among other things  making it difficult for us to raise additional debt or equity financing to the extent needed for our continued operations or for planned expansion 
we may not become profitable or significantly increase our revenue 
we incurred net losses of million  million and million  for the years  and  respectively 
to achieve profitability  we will need to generate and sustain sufficient revenues while maintaining reasonable cost and expense levels 
we expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses primarily to support research and development and expansion of our sales and marketing efforts 
these expenditures may not result in increased revenues or customer growth 
we do not know when or if we will become profitable 
we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
our losses from operations  our use of cash in operating activities  and our accumulated deficit and working capital deficiency at december  and  among other factors  raised substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and led our independent auditors to include in their opinions contained in our consolidated financial statements as of december  and and for each of the years in the three year period ended december  an explanatory paragraph related to our ability to continue as a going concern 
analysts and investors generally view reports of independent auditors questioning a company s ability to continue as a going concern unfavorably 
these reports may make it difficult for us to raise additional debt or equity financing to the extent needed for our continued operations or for planned expansion  particularly if we are unable to attain and maintain profitable operations in the future 
consequently  future losses may adversely affect our business  prospects  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we urge potential investors to review the reports of our independent auditors and our consolidated financial statements before making a decision to invest in our company 
we may be unable to obtain additional funding on satisfactory terms  which could interfere with our existing and planned operations  dilute our stockholders or impose burdensome financial restrictions on our business 
historically  we have relied upon cash from financing activities to fund a significant portion of the cash requirements of our operating and investing activities  and there is no assurance we will be able to generate sufficient cash from our operating activities in the future 
we do not expect future fixed obligations to be paid from operations during and intend to satisfy fixed obligations by obtaining additional debt and or equity financing  using accounts receivable financing  extending vendor payments  selling investments and issuing stock as payment on obligations 
some of our secured convertible promissory notes contain the grant of a continuing security interest in substantially all of our assets and restrict our ability to obtain debt and or equity financing 
in addition  deteriorating global economic conditions and the effects of military actions may cause prolonged declines in investor confidence in and accessibility to capital markets 
any future financing may cause significant dilution to existing stockholders 
any debt financing or other financing of securities senior to common stock will likely include financial and other covenants that will restrict our flexibility 
at a minimum  we expect these covenants to include restrictions on our ability to pay dividends on our common stock 
any failure to comply with these covenants would adversely affect our business  prospects  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
financing arrangements to raise additional funds may require us to relinquish rights to certain technologies  products or marketing territories 
our failure to raise capital when needed and on terms acceptable to us could adversely affect our business  operating results  financial condition and prospects by impairing our ability to fund our existing and planned operations 
defaults under our secured credit arrangements could result in a foreclosure on our assets by our creditors 
all of our assets are pledged as collateral to secure portions of our debt 
we were not able to obtain waivers for past covenant defaults  and we may in the future default under certain covenants of these credit arrangements 
this means that if we are unable to obtain waivers in the future or if we incur a monetary default on our secured debt obligations  our indebtedness could become immediately due and payable and the lenders could foreclose on our assets 
we have not generated any significant sales of our products within the competitive commercial market nor have we established a sufficient sales and marketing force to promote our products to potential commercial customers  which makes it difficult to evaluate our current business performance and future prospects 
although we have had some success in selling our security solutions to government agencies  we are just beginning to enter the complex and competitive commercial market for digital commerce and communications security solutions 
we believe that many potential customers in our target markets are not fully aware of the need for security products and services in the digital economy 
historically  only enterprises that had substantial resources developed or purchased security solutions for delivery of digital content over the internet or through other means 
also  there is a perception that security in delivering digital content is costly and difficult to implement 
therefore  we will not succeed unless we can educate our target markets about the need for security in delivering digital content and convince potential customers of our ability to provide this security in a cost effective and easy to use manner 
even if we convince our target markets about the importance of and need for such security  we do not know if this will result in the sale of our products 
we may be unable to establish sales and marketing operations at levels necessary for us to grow this portion of our business  especially if we are unsuccessful at selling this product into vertical markets 
we may not be able to support the promotional programs required by selling simultaneously into several markets 
if we are unable to develop an efficient sales system  or if our products or components do not achieve wide market acceptance  then our operating results will suffer and our earnings per share will be adversely affected 
we face intense competition and pricing pressures from a number of sources  which may reduce our average selling prices and gross margins 
the markets for our products and services are intensely competitive 
as a result  we face significant competition from a number of sources 
we may be unable to compete successfully because many of our competitors are more established  benefit from greater name recognition and have substantially greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we have 
in addition  there are several smaller and start up companies with which we compete from time to time 
we expect competition to increase as a result of consolidation in the information security technology and product reseller industries 
the average selling prices for our products may decline as a result of competitive pricing pressures  promotional programs and customers who negotiate price reductions in exchange for longer term purchase commitments 
the pricing of products depends on the specific features and functions of the products  purchase volumes and the level of sales and service support required 
we expect competition to increase in the future 
as we experience pricing pressure  we anticipate that the average selling prices and gross margins for our products will decrease over product lifecycles 
these same competitive pressures may require us to write down the carrying value of any inventory on hand  which would adversely impact our operating results and adversely affect our earnings per share 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from a small number of customers  and the loss of only one of those customers could adversely impact our operating results 
we depend on a limited number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenue 
during the years ended december   and  we derived  and  respectively  of our consolidated net revenue for that year from an individual customer 
many of our contracts with our significant customers are short term contracts 
the non renewal of any significant contract upon expiration  or a substantial reduction in sales to any of our significant customers  would adversely affect our business unless we were able to replace the revenue we received from those customers 
our reliance on third party technologies for the development of some of our products and our reliance on third parties for manufacturing may delay product launch  impair our ability to develop and deliver products or hurt our ability to compete in the market 
our ability to license new technologies from third parties is and will continue to be critical to our ability to offer a complete suite of products that meets customer needs and technological requirements 
some of our licenses do not run for the full duration of the third party s patent for the licensed technology 
we may not be able to renew our existing licenses on favorable terms  or at all 
if we lose the rights to a patented technology  we may need to stop selling or may need to redesign our products that incorporate that technology  and we may lose a competitive advantage 
in addition  competitors could obtain licenses for technologies for which we are unable to obtain licenses  and third parties may develop or enable others to develop a similar solution to digital communication security issues  either of which events could erode our market share 
also  dependence on the patent protection of third parties may not afford us any control over the protection of the technologies upon which we rely 
if the patent protection of any of these third parties were compromised  our ability to compete in the market also would be impaired 
third parties could obtain access to our proprietary information or could independently develop similar technologies because of the limited protection for our intellectual property 
despite the precautions we take  third parties may copy or obtain and use our proprietary technologies  ideas  know how and other proprietary information without authorization or may independently develop technologies similar or superior to our technologies 
in addition  the confidentiality and non competition agreements between us and our employees  distributors and clients may not provide meaningful protection of our proprietary technologies or other intellectual property in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure 
policing unauthorized use of our technologies and other intellectual property is difficult  particularly because the global nature of the internet makes it difficult to control the ultimate destination or security of software or other data transmitted 
furthermore  the laws of other jurisdictions may afford little or no effective protection of our intellectual property rights 
our business  financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property rights 
we may face harmful claims of infringement of proprietary rights  which could require us to devote substantial time and resources toward modifying our products or obtaining appropriate licenses 
there is a risk that our products infringe the proprietary rights of third parties 
regardless of whether our products infringe on proprietary rights of third parties  infringement or invalidity claims may be asserted or prosecuted against us and we could incur significant expenses in defending them 
if any infringement claims or actions are asserted against us  we may be required to modify our products or seek licenses for these intellectual property rights 
we may not be able to modify our products or obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms  in a timely manner or at all 
our failure to do so could adversely affect our business by preventing us from selling some or all of our products 
our inability to maintain and develop new strategic relationships with partners and suppliers could impact our ability to obtain or sell our products  and prevent us from generating sales revenues 
we obtain and sell many of our products through strategic alliance and supplier agreements 
the loss of any of our existing strategic relationships  or the inability to create new strategic relationships in the future  could adversely affect our ability to develop and market our products 
we depend upon our partners to develop and market products and to fund and perform their obligations as contemplated by our agreements with them 
we do not control the time and resources devoted by our partners to these activities 
these relationships may not continue or may require us to spend significant financial  personnel and administrative resources from time to time 
we may not have the resources available to satisfy our commitments  which may adversely affect our strategic relationships 
further  our products and services may compete with the products and services of our strategic partners 
this competition may adversely affect our relationships with our strategic partners  which could adversely affect our business 
if alliance or supplier agreements are cancelled  modified or delayed  if alliance or supplier partners decide not to purchase our products or to purchase only limited quantities of our products  or if we are unable to enter into additional alliance or supplier agreements  our ability to produce and sell our products and to generate sales revenues could be adversely affected 
any compromise of pki technology would adversely affect our business by reducing or eliminating demand for many of our data security products 
many of our products are based on public key infrastructure  or pki  technology  which is the standard technology for securing internet based commerce and communications 
the security afforded by this technology depends on the integrity of a user s private key  which depends in part on the application of algorithms  or advanced mathematical factoring equations 
the occurrence of any of the following could result in a decline in demand for our data security products o any significant advance in techniques for attacking pki systems  including the development of an easy factoring method or faster  more powerful computers  o publicity of the successful decoding of cryptographic messages or the misappropriation of private keys  and o government regulation limiting the use  scope or strength of pki 
a security breach of our internal systems or those of our customers due to computer hackers or cyber terrorists could harm our business by adversely affecting the market s perception of our products and services 
since we provide security for internet and other digital communication networks  we may become a target for attacks by computer hackers 
the ripple effects throughout the economy of terrorist threats and attacks and military activities may have a prolonged effect on our potential commercial customers  or on their ability to purchase our products and services 
additionally  because we provide security products to the united states government  we may be targeted by cyber terrorist groups for activities threatened against united states based targets 
we will not succeed unless the marketplace is confident that we provide effective security protection for internet and other digital communication networks 
networks protected by our products may be vulnerable to electronic break ins 
because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target  we may be unable to anticipate these techniques 
although we have not experienced any act of sabotage or unauthorized access by a third party of our internal network to date  if an actual or perceived breach of security for internet and other digital communication networks occurs in our internal systems or those of our end user customers  regardless of whether we caused the breach  it could adversely affect the market s perception of our products and services 
this could cause us to lose customers  resellers  alliance partners or other business partners 
we may be exposed to significant liability for actual or perceived failure to provide required products or services 
products as complex as those we offer may contain undetected errors or may fail when first introduced or when new versions are released 
despite our product testing efforts and testing by current and potential customers  it is possible that errors will be found in new products or enhancements after commencement of commercial shipments 
the occurrence of product defects or errors could result in adverse publicity  delay in product introduction  diversion of resources to remedy defects  loss of or a delay in market acceptance  or claims by customers against us  or could cause us to incur additional costs  any of which could adversely affect our business 
because our customers rely on our products for critical security applications  we may be exposed to claims for damages allegedly caused to an enterprise as a result of an actual or perceived failure of our products 
an actual or perceived breach of enterprise network or data security systems of one of our customers  regardless of whether the breach is attributable to our products or solutions  could adversely affect our business reputation 
furthermore  our failure or inability to meet a customer s expectations in the performance of our services  or to do so in the time frame required by the customer  regardless of our responsibility for the failure  could o result in a claim for substantial damages against us by the customer  o discourage customers from engaging us for these services  and o damage our business reputation 
if use of the internet and other communication networks based on internet protocols does not continue to grow  demand for our products may not increase 
increased demand for our products largely depends on the continued growth of the internet and internet protocol based networks and the widespread acceptance and use of these mediums for electronic commerce and communications 
because electronic commerce and communications over these networks are evolving  we cannot predict the size of the market and its sustainable growth rate 
a number of factors may affect market size and growth rate  including increases in governmental regulation and the continued ability of the internet infrastructure and communications services to support growing demands  which ability could be adversely affected by  among other things  delays in development or adoption of new standards and protocols to handle increased levels of activity 
if the use of electronic commerce and communications does not increase  or increases more slowly than we expect  demand for our products and services will be adversely impacted 
if we do not respond to rapid technological changes  our product and service offerings could become obsolete 
the markets we serve are characterized by rapidly changing technology  emerging industry standards and frequent introduction of new products 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards may render our products obsolete or less marketable 
the process of developing our products and services is extremely complex and requires significant continuing development efforts 
if we are unable to modify existing products and develop new products and services that are responsive to changing technology and standards and to meet customer needs in a timely and cost effective manner  our business could be adversely affected because we would be unable to sell our product and service offerings that have become obsolete 
doing business with the united states government entails many risks that could adversely affect us by decreasing the profitability of governmental contracts we are able to obtain and interfering with our ability to obtain future governmental contracts 
sales to united states federal government agencies accounted for   and of our consolidated revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our sales to these agencies are subject to risks that include o early termination of our contracts  o disallowance of costs upon audit  and o the need to participate in competitive bidding and proposal processes  which are costly and time consuming and may result in unprofitable contracts 
in addition  the government may be in a position to obtain greater rights with respect to our intellectual property than we would grant to other entities 
government agencies also have the power  based on financial difficulties or investigations of their contractors  to deem contractors unsuitable for new contract awards 
because we engage in the governmental contracting business  we have been and will be subject to audits and may be subject to investigation by governmental entities 
failure to comply with the terms of any of our governmental contracts could result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties  as well as our suspension from future governmental contracts for a significant period of time  any of which could adversely affect our business by requiring us to spend money to pay the fines and penalties and prohibiting us from earning revenues from governmental contracts during the suspension period 
delays in deliveries from our suppliers or defects in goods or components supplied by our vendors could cause our revenues and gross margins to decline 
we rely on a limited number of vendors for certain components for the products we are developing 
any undetected flaws in components supplied by our vendors could lead to unanticipated costs to repair or replace these parts 
we currently purchase some of our components from a single supplier  which presents a risk that the components may not be available in the future on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
for example  atmel corporation has completed development of a specially designed forte microprocessor that we have incorporated into a forte pki card 
commercial acceptance of the forte microprocessor will be dependent on continued development of applications to service customer requirements 
any inability to receive or any delay in receiving adequate supplies of the forte microprocessor  whether as a result of delays in development of applications or otherwise  would adversely affect our ability to sell the forte pki card 
we do not anticipate maintaining a supply agreement with atmel corporation for the forte microprocessor 
if atmel corporation were unable to deliver the forte microprocessor for a lengthy period of time or were to terminate its relationship with us  we would be unable to produce the forte pki card until we could design a replacement computer chip for the forte microprocessor 
we anticipate this would take substantial time and resources to complete  which could result in delays or reductions in product shipments that could adversely affect our business by requiring us to expend resources while preventing us from selling the forte pki card 
also  if we are unable to obtain or generate sufficient funds to sustain our operations  we may damage our relationships with our vendors 
slow and delinquent payments may cause vendors not to sell products to us  or only with advance payment 
if this occurs  we will not have components and services available for our products 
we may not be able to replace any of our supply sources on economically advantageous terms 
further  if we experience price increases for the components for our products  we will experience declines in our gross margins 
our success depends on our ability to retain our current management team 
our founder  co chairman and co chief executive officer  kris shah  has been with us since  and our co chairman and co chief executive officer  marvin winkler  co founded one of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
their experience  expertise  industry knowledge and historical company knowledge would be extremely difficult to replace if we were to lose the services of either of them 
the precise impact of the loss of services of either of them is difficult to predict  but would likely result in  at a minimum  significant costs to recruit  hire and retain a successor and impaired operating results while the successor was being recruited and transitioning into the position 
we do not currently maintain life insurance on the lives of either of these officers 
there is significant competition in our industry for highly skilled employees  and our failure to attract and retain technical personnel would adversely affect our business by impairing our ability to efficiently conduct our operations 
we may not be able to attract or retain highly skilled employees 
our inability to hire or retain highly qualified individuals may impede our ability to develop  install  implement and service our software and hardware systems  to retain existing customers and attract new customers  or to efficiently conduct our operations  all of which would adversely affect our business 
a high level of employee mobility characterizes the data security and networking solution industries  and the market for highly qualified individuals in computer related fields is intense 
this competition means there are fewer highly qualified employees available to hire  and the costs of hiring and retaining these individuals are high 
even if we are able to hire these individuals  we may be unable to retain them 
furthermore  the hiring and retention of technical employees necessitates the issuance of stock options and other equity interests  which may dilute earnings per share 
our efforts to expand our international operations are subject to a number of risks  any of which could adversely affect our future international sales 
we plan to increase our international sales 
our inability to obtain or maintain federal or foreign regulatory approvals relating to the import or export of our products on a timely basis could adversely affect our ability to expand our international business 
additionally  our international operations could be subject to a number of risks  any of which could adversely affect our future international sales  including o increased collection risks  o trade restrictions  o export duties and tariffs  o uncertain political  regulatory and economic developments  and o inability to protect our intellectual property rights 
we are unable to predict the extent to which the resolution of lawsuits pending against us and our subsidiary could adversely affect our business by  among other things  subjecting us to substantial costs and liabilities and diverting management s attention and resources 
g resources  inc and classical financial services  llc have filed complaints against pulsar alleging that pulsar breached a contract by failing to make payments to g resources  inc in connection with services allegedly provided by g resources  inc in april  the court dismissed  for lack of prosecution activity for more than twelve months  the original complaint that g resources  inc had filed against pulsar in january g resources  inc 
re filed the action in may in  the court moved this case into the same division handling other matters related to g and classic financial services  llc 
pulsar intends to vigorously defend against the plaintiffs claims and has asserted defenses and counterclaims 
in may  contemporary services corporation filed an action against us alleging breach of contract  fraud  negligent misrepresentation and violation of california corporations code section the action relates to a term sheet agreement that we entered into with the plaintiff in october in connection with a potential strategic relationship between the plaintiff and us 
we filed an answer and cross complaint 
while we continued to believe we would prevail at trial  in february  we reached an agreement to settle the case for less than  which will be jointly paid by our insurance carrier and us 
our estimated portion of the settlement has been accrued in the results of the year ended december  in may  integral systems  inc filed an action against us alleging that we breached a promissory note for the payment of  and then obtained a confessed judgment for approximately  in march we executed settlement papers that would permit integral systems to file a stipulated judgment against us in the amount of the unpaid balance if we default on a payment schedule that requires us to make payments of  per month until the balance is paid in full 
in june  research venture  llc filed two lawsuits against us alleging unlawful detainer and seeking possession of two leased properties  alleged damages and lost rent 
we surrendered possession of both properties and negotiated a restructuring of our obligations under the leases 
under the restructuring arrangement  we agreed to make cash payments to research venture aggregating  and we issued  shares of common stock and a subordinated convertible promissory note in the principal amount of  that represents prepaid rent on a property we are leasing from research venture and is convertible into an aggregate of up to  shares of common stock 
research venture will be entitled to entry of the stipulated judgment in the maximum aggregate amount of million  less consideration we pay prior to any entry of the judgment  if we do not comply with the terms of the restructuring arrangement through december in july  synnex technology filed a lawsuit against us in the superior court of orange county  case no 
cc  alleging that we failed to pay  for products purchased by us for resale 
we and synnex agreed to settle the matter by payment of ten equal installments of  pursuant to a stipulation for entry of judgment that is to be held by counsel for synnex and not filed with the court absent breach by us 
the last payment is due on or before june   at which time the action will be dismissed 
to date  all required payments have been made 
any or all of these litigation matters could subject us to substantial costs and liabilities and divert our management s attention and resources during our current and future financial reporting periods 
if we believe it is probable that we will incur an estimable amount of expenses in connection with a litigation matter  we will include the estimated amount of expenses in accounts payable or accrued liabilities 
if we feel unable to make a reasonable judgment as to the ultimate outcome of  or to assess or quantify our exposure relating to  a litigation matter  we will not include in our financial statements an estimated amount of expenses for that matter 
consequently  if we are unable during any financial reporting period to accurately estimate our potential liability in connection with a litigation matter  our financial condition and results of operations in future financial reporting periods may be adversely affected when we record any unreserved costs or liabilities we actually have incurred in connection with a litigation matter 
a number of vendors have filed or threatened to file lawsuits to collect amounts due from us 
if we are unable to reach a favorable resolution of these matters  we may have to defend ourselves in costly litigation and be subject to substantial monetary judgments 
during  several vendors filed or threatened to file suits against us related to outstanding account balances that are included within our accounts payable 
we reached oral agreement with several vendors  including one vendor who had filed suit against us 
we are making payments on the amount owed to the vendor who filed suit against us and executed an agreement to extend the terms of the existing accounts payable balance 
the vendor has indicated that it will execute and return the agreement to us  but as of march   we had not received the executed agreement 
if the collection suit goes to judgment  there would be an adverse impact on our financial condition and liquidity 
governmental regulations affecting security of internet and other digital communication networks could limit the market for our products and services 
the united states government and foreign governments have imposed controls  export license requirements and restrictions on the import or export of some technologies  including encryption technology 
any additional governmental regulation of imports or exports or failure to obtain required export approval of encryption technologies could delay or prevent the acceptance and use of encryption products and public networks for secure communications and could limit the market for our products and services 
in addition  some foreign competitors are subject to less rigorous controls on exporting their encryption technologies 
as a result  they may be able to compete more effectively than us in the united states and in international security markets for internet and other digital communication networks 
in addition  governmental agencies such as the federal communications commission periodically issue regulations governing the conduct of business in telecommunications markets that may negatively affect the telecommunications industry and us 
biz acquisition related accounting charges may continue to delay or reduce our profitability 
we accounted for our august acquisition of biz as a purchase 
under the purchase method of accounting  the purchase price was allocated to the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities that we acquired from biz 
the excess of the purchase price over biz s tangible net assets resulted in goodwill and other intangible assets 
in july  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement  goodwill and other intangible assets 
we adopted this statement effective january  under this statement  goodwill is no longer amortized and is subject to annual testing for impairment beginning january  the provisions of this statement require us to perform a two step test to assess goodwill for impairment 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  then goodwill is not impaired and we need not proceed to the second step 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then we must determine and compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to the carrying value of its goodwill 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we will record an impairment loss in the amount of the excess 
with regard to a reporting unit s goodwill balance at january   we were required to perform the first step of the annual testing for impairment by june  if the results of that step indicated that goodwill may be impaired  we would then be required to complete the second step as soon as possible  but no later than december  as of december   we assessed the fair value of our two reporting units by comparing the book value of our equity interests to the fair value of our equity interests based upon the terms of a financing we completed in april given consideration of this comparison and relevant factors  we concluded that as of december   an impairment write down of approximately million was required 
we reviewed the assumptions used in the original analysis performed as of december  for dates of march   june   and september  and concluded that such analyses continued to be adequate and no additional write down was required 
we later performed an assessment of our information security products and services reporting unit 
the assessment was performed to measure the fair value of the remaining goodwill as of december  using a multi period discounted cash flow method 
the results of the analysis indicated that no additional write down was required as of december  we are required to perform tests for impairment at least annually 
tests for impairment between annual tests may be required if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the net carrying amount 
we cannot predict whether or when there will be additional impairment charges  or the amount of any such charges 
if the charges are significant  they could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
a relocation of our software development to india could prove to be unprofitable due to risks inherent in international business activities 
we may relocate portions of our software development activities to india in an effort to reduce our operating expenses 
we are subject to a number of risks associated with international business activities that could adversely affect any operations we may develop in india and could slow our growth 
these risks generally include  among others o difficulties in managing and staffing our indian operations  o difficulties in obtaining or maintaining regulatory approvals or in complying with indian laws  o reduced or less certain protection for intellectual property rights  o differing technological advances  preferences or requirements  o trade restrictions  o foreign currency fluctuations  and o general economic conditions  including instability  in the indian market 
any of these risks could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
conflicts involving india could adversely affect any operations we may establish in india  which could interfere with our ability to conduct any or all of our other operations 
south asia has from time to time experienced civil unrest and hostilities among neighboring countries  including india and pakistan 
in april  india and pakistan conducted long range missile tests 
since may  military confrontations between india and pakistan have occurred in disputed regions 
in october  the leadership of pakistan changed as a result of a coup led by the military 
additionally  recent events have significantly heightened the tensions between india and pakistan 
if a major armed conflict or nuclear war involving india and any of its neighboring countries occurs  it could  among other things  prevent us from establishing or maintaining operations in india 
if the successful conduct of operations in india becomes critical to any or all of our other operations  our business would be harmed to the extent we are unable to establish or maintain operations in india 
we are exposed to liability for actions taken by our domestic employees while on assignment and may also be exposed to liability for actions taken by any foreign employees we may hire 
as a professional services provider  a portion of our business involves employing people and placing them in the workplace of other businesses 
therefore  we are exposed to liability for actions taken by our employees while on assignment 
in addition  to the extent we hire employees in india or other foreign locations  we may also be exposed to liability for actions taken by those employees in the scope of their employment 
nasdaq may delist our common stock  which could decrease the market price of our common stock and make it more difficult for our stockholders to dispose of or obtain quotations for our common stock and for us to obtain financing 
delisting also would entitle a third party to file a potentially substantial stipulated judgment against us 
the quantitative listing standards of the nasdaq national market require  among other things  that listed companies maintain a minimum bid price of 
in november  we received a notice from nasdaq indicating that our common stock had failed to maintain the required minimum bid price of for the last consecutive trading days and that  therefore  we had until february  to regain compliance with that requirement 
we did not timely regain compliance with that requirement 
in march  we received a notice from nasdaq that the period to regain compliance with the minimum bid price has been extended and additional days  through may  if we fail to timely regain compliance with that requirement  or if we fail to maintain compliance with any other listing requirement  nasdaq staff likely will provide written notice to us that our common stock will be delisted 
at that time  we intend to appeal the staff s determination to a listing qualifications panel for consideration 
alternatively  we may be permitted to submit an application to transfer the listing of our common stock to the nasdaq smallcap market if we satisfy the continued inclusion requirements for the nasdaq smallcap market 
the successful transfer of the listing of our common stock to the nasdaq smallcap market would make available an extended grace period through august  for the minimum bid price requirement and would make available an additional calendar day grace period if we meet the initial listing criteria for the nasdaq smallcap market 
in addition to minimum bid price requirements  nasdaq s qualification standards require  among other things  that issuers apply for initial inclusion on nasdaq following a change of control 
nasdaq looks at many factors in determining whether a change of control has occurred  including without limitation  changes in the management  board of directors  voting power and ownership of a company 
depending on the terms and conditions of any future financings or other transactions we may enter into  if nasdaq determines that a change of control has occurred  we would need to file a new listing application if we want to maintain our nasdaq listing 
we do not know whether  at the time  if any  that we would file a new listing application with nasdaq  we would meet the initial listing standards of either the nasdaq national market or the nasdaq smallcap market 
if we are delisted from the nasdaq national market  our stock price could decline further and the ability of any potential or future investors to achieve liquidity from our common stock could be severely limited  particularly if we are unable to transfer the listing of our common stock to the nasdaq smallcap market 
this could inhibit  if not preclude  our ability to raise additional working capital on acceptable terms  if at all 
also  if we are delisted from the nasdaq national market  research venture  llc  a party with whom we have entered into a litigation settlement  would be entitled to entry of a stipulated judgment against us in the maximum aggregate amount of million  less consideration we pay prior to any entry of the judgment 
the non cash interest expense required in connection with the detachable warrants and beneficial conversion features of our april financing may adversely affect our stock price 
the secured convertible promissory notes we issued in april are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price below the market price of our common stock at the commitment date for the notes 
in addition  the notes were accompanied by common stock purchase warrants with an exercise price below the market price of our common stock at the commitment date 
accordingly  under accounting guidelines  we were required to record a substantial non cash charge as interest expense  with an offsetting increase to our paid in capital 
while recording this entry had no effect on our stockholders equity  the entry substantially increased our reported loss for the year ended december  and may cause a decline in our stock price 
our common stock price is subject to significant volatility  which could result in substantial losses for investors and in litigation against us 
the stock market as a whole and individual stocks historically have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which often have been unrelated to the performance of the related corporations 
during the week period ended march   the high and low closing sale prices of our common stock were and  respectively 
the market price of our common stock may exhibit significant fluctuations in the future in response to various factors  many of which are beyond our control and which include o variations in our annual or quarterly financial results  which variations could result from  among other things  the timing  size  mix and customer acceptance of our product and service offerings and those of our competitors  and the timing and magnitude of required capital expenditures  o company issued earnings announcements that vary from consensus analyst estimates  o changes by financial research analysts in their recommendations or estimates of our earnings  o conditions in the economy in general or in the information technology service sector in particular  o announcements of technological innovations or new products or services by us or our competitors  and o unfavorable publicity or changes in applicable laws and regulations  or their judicial or administrative interpretations  affecting the information technology service sector and us 
if our operating results in future quarters fall below the expectations of market makers  securities analysts and investors  the price of our common stock likely will decline  perhaps substantially 
in the past  securities class action litigation often has been brought against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities 
we may in the future be the target of similar litigation 
securities litigation could result in substantial costs and liabilities and could divert management s attention and resources 
consequently  the price at which you purchase shares of our common stock may not be indicative of the price that will prevail in the trading market 
you may be unable to sell your shares of common stock at or above your purchase price  which may result in substantial losses to you 
a significant number of shares of our common stock are or will become eligible for public sale  and sales of large numbers of our shares could adversely affect their market price and make it difficult for us to raise additional capital through sales of equity securities 
as of march   we had issued and outstanding  shares of common stock  a majority of which were unrestricted  were eligible for resale without registration under rule of the securities act of  or were registered for resale or issued with registration rights 
our common stock historically has been thinly traded 
our average daily trading volume between march  and march  was  shares 
if our stockholders seek to sell numbers of shares significantly in excess of our typical volume  the market price of our shares may decline 
any adverse effect on the market price for our common stock could make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate 
future conversions or exercises of our outstanding derivative securities  particularly those that contain full ratchet anti dilution provisions  could substantially dilute your investment by causing large numbers of shares of our common stock to be issued in the future 
convertible notes and warrants such as those that we issued in april contain full ratchet anti dilution provisions that are in effect through april  this means that if we issue any common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for common stock prior to april  for consideration less than the conversion price of the notes initially  per share or the exercise price of the warrants initially  per share  then the conversion price of the notes and or the exercise price of the warrants automatically will adjust down to the consideration per share in the new issuance 
so  for example  if we issue an option to purchase shares of our common stock at per share  both the conversion price of the notes and the exercise price of the warrants will be reduced to per share  and the number of shares underlying the warrants will be increased in proportion to the reduction in the warrant exercise price 
declines in the market price of our common stock  future market conditions and our present and future cash needs may require us to issue securities at a lower price 
if we do so without obtaining a waiver of the anti dilution provisions  then the new  lower effective conversion price of the convertible notes would cause even more shares of our common stock to become issuable upon conversion of the notes  and the number of shares underlying the warrants would be adjusted upward in proportion to the downward adjustment to the warrant exercise price  creating the possibility of significant dilution of any future earnings per share 
if our security holders engage in short sales of our common stock  including sales of shares to be issued upon conversion or exercise of derivative securities  the price of our common stock may decline 
selling short is a technique used by a security holder to take advantage of an anticipated decline in the price of a security 
a significant number of short sales or a large volume of other sales within a relatively short period of time can create downward pressure on the market price of a security 
the decrease in market price would allow holders of our derivative securities that have conversion or exercise prices based upon a discount on the market price of our common stock to convert or exercise their derivative securities into or for an increased number of shares of our common stock 
further sales of common stock issued upon conversion or exercise of our derivative securities could cause even greater declines in the price of our common stock due to the number of additional shares available in the market  which could encourage short sales that could further undermine the value of our common stock 
you could  therefore  experience a decline in the value of your investment as a result of short sales of our common stock 
if we are unsuccessful in complying with our registration obligations  we may be in default under our secured convertible promissory notes and litigation settlements and could face significant penalties and a substantial stipulated judgment 
the agreements we entered into in connection with our issuance of secured convertible promissory notes and related warrants and in connection with settlement of litigation require us to  among other things  register for resale the shares of common stock issued or issuable under those arrangements and to maintain the effectiveness of the registration statements for an extended period of time 
if we are unable to timely obtain and maintain effectiveness of the required registration statements  or if we default under the arrangements for any other reason  then the holders of the notes could  among other things  require us to pay substantial penalties  require us to repay the notes at a premium and or foreclose upon their security interest in our assets  and the parties to the settlement arrangements could take action against us that could include the filing of a substantial stipulated judgment 
any of these events would adversely affect our business  operating results  financial condition  and ability to service our other indebtedness by negatively impacting our cash flows 
a small number of stockholders  who include certain of our officers and directors  have the ability to control stockholder votes and to take action by written consent without a meeting of stockholders 
as of march   kris shah  marvin winkler and certain of their family members and affiliates owned  in the aggregate  approximately of our outstanding common stock 
those stockholders  if acting together  have the ability to elect our directors and to determine the outcome of corporate actions requiring stockholder approval  irrespective of how our other stockholders may vote 
further  those stockholders have the ability to take action by written consent on those matters without a meeting of stockholders 
those matters could include the election of directors  changes in the size and composition of the board of directors  and mergers and other business combinations involving our company 
in addition  through control of the board of directors and voting power  they may be able to control certain decisions  including decisions regarding the qualification and appointment of officers  dividend policy  access to capital including borrowing from third party lenders and the issuance of additional equity securities  and the acquisition or disposition of our assets 
also  the concentration of voting power in the hands of those individuals could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company  even if the change in control would benefit our stockholders  and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we own class a common stock of wave systems corp  which stock is classified as trading securities 
the stock is listed on the nasdaq national market 
the increase or decrease in value of the stock is included in our statement of operations together with the gain or loss on sales of the stock 
as of december   we had approximately  shares with an aggregate value of approximately  for the years ended december  and  we recorded realized loss on trading securities of approximately  and  respectively
