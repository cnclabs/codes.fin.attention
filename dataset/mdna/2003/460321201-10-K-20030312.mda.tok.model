critical accounting policies set forth below is a discussion of the accounting policies and related estimates that the company believes are the most critical to understanding its consolidated financial statements  financial condition  and results of operations and which require complex management judgments  uncertainties and or estimates 
information regarding the company s other accounting policies is included in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
voyage revenue and expense recognition revenues and expenses relating to voyages are recorded over the duration of the voyage including all inland moves  for which revenues and expenses are fully recognized upon completion of the mother vessel voyage 
provisions for loss voyages are recorded when contracts for the voyages are fixed and when losses become apparent for voyages in progress 
voyage revenue and expense recognition requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
drydocking costs the company defers certain costs related to the drydocking of its vessels 
deferred drydocking costs are capitalized as incurred and amortized on a straight line basis over the period between drydockings generally two to five years 
income taxes deferred income taxes are provided on items of income and expense  which affect taxable income in one period and financial income in another 
certain foreign operations are not subject to income taxation under pertinent provisions of the laws of the country of incorporation or operation 
however  pursuant to existing us tax laws  earnings from certain foreign operations are subject to us income taxes 
self retention insurance the company maintains provisions for its estimated losses under its self retention insurance based on estimates of the eventual claims settlement costs 
the company s policy is to establish self insurance provisions for each policy year based on independent actuarial estimates  and to maintain the provisions at those levels for the estimated run off period  approximately two years from the inception of that period 
the company believes most claims will be reported  or estimates for existing claims will be revised  within this two year period 
subsequent to this two year period  self insurance reserves are adjusted to reflect the company s current estimate of its loss exposure for the policy year 
however  if during this two year period the company s estimate of its loss exposure exceeds the actuarial estimate  then additional loss provisions are recorded to increase the self insurance reserves to the company s estimate of the eventual claims settlement cost 
the measurement of the company s exposure for self insurance liability requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amount of loss provisions recorded during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
results of operations the company s vessels are operated under a variety of charters and contracts 
the nature of these arrangements is such that  without a material variation in gross voyage profits total revenues less voyage expenses and vessel and barge depreciation  the revenues and expenses attributable to a vessel deployed under one type of charter or contract can differ substantially from those attributable to the same vessel if deployed under a different type of charter or contract 
accordingly  depending on the mix of charters or contracts in place during a particular accounting period  the company s revenues and expenses can fluctuate substantially from one period to another even though the number of vessels deployed  the number of voyages completed  the amount of cargo carried  and the gross voyage profit derived from the vessels remain relatively constant 
as a result  fluctuations in voyage revenues and expenses are not necessarily indicative of trends in profitability  and management believes that gross voyage profit is a more appropriate measure of operating performance than revenues 
accordingly  the discussion below addresses variations in gross voyage profits rather than variations in revenues 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  gross voyage profit gross voyage profit before depreciation and impairment loss decreased from million in to million in the changes associated with each of the company s segments are discussed below 
liner service the decrease in gross voyage profit before depreciation and impairment loss for this segment from a loss of million in to a loss of million in was primarily due to lower gross voyage profit from the company s foreign flag lash liner service of million resulting from lower rates for eastbound cargo and higher than normal towage expenses for lash barges as a result of high water on the mississippi river and higher interstate towage expenses 
additionally  in  this service experienced a drop in cargo volume as a result of lower westbound cargo volumes due to sanctions recently imposed by the president on steel imports 
partially offsetting the decrease in gross voyage profit before depreciation and impairment loss was an improvement of million from the elimination of the four vessel us flag lash liner service 
expenses associated with winding down the service were offset by the reduction of loss provisions for insurance and other accruals during the year which are discussed in more detail in the paragraphs below 
additionally  the commencement of the renewed us flag lash service in november of contributed gross voyage profit of approximately  the company reduced its insurance provisions during resulting from a review of the company s current estimate of its loss exposure for the policy year that reached the end of its two year period as well as from a reduction in the estimated total remaining loss exposure related to the us flag lash liner service 
the company determined that the provisions for this policy year  which were based on actuarial estimates  exceeded the company s loss exposure estimate  mainly as related to personal injury claims 
the company routinely reviews its self retention loss provisions and makes adjustments as it believes they are warranted 
during  the company reduced the estimated provision by approximately million  of which million was related to the liner services segment 
the company maintains accruals for amounts due to us customs related to repair work performed on us flag ships at foreign shipyards 
us customs advised the company during the second quarter of that several claims related to the us flag lash liner service would be settled and would require payment within a year 
as a result  the portion of accruals associated with the company s settlement estimate was reclassified from long term to current liabilities as of december  additionally in  as a result of recent settlements  the company revised its estimates of amounts due to us customs  which resulted in an increase in gross voyage profit of the liner services segment of approximately million 
as a result of the discontinuation of the us flag lash liner service  the company recognized expenses associated with the winding down of the service of million during time charter contracts this segment s gross voyage profit before depreciation and impairment loss decreased from million in to million in the decrease resulted from the sale and leaseback of two of the company s pctcs during the second half of  renegotiated lease terms on another pctc that resulted in different accounting treatment  and offhire time for repair work on the company s coal carrier 
the contracts under which the three pctcs operate were not affected by the aforementioned lease transactions 
however  because the leases now qualify for treatment as operating leases  the lease payments of million were included in voyage expenses during the resulting increase in voyage expenses approximates the depreciation and interest charges recorded on these vessels during  which were eliminated by the lease transactions 
also contributing to the decrease was the sale of the company s cape size bulk carrier in the decrease was partially offset by an increase of approximately million in revenue earned by the company s pctcs due to carrying more supplemental cargoes during and by  related to the reduction of loss provisions for insurance and other accruals during the year discussed previously

contracts of affreightment gross voyage profit before depreciation decreased slightly from million in to million in the transportation contract under which the company s molten sulphur carrier operates was assigned by freeport mcmoran sulphur llc to gulf sulphur services ltd  llp during the second quarter of the terms of the contract were not affected by the assignment 
rail ferry service this segment s gross voyage loss before depreciation of approximately million in improved from a loss of million in the improvement resulted primarily from an increase in rail cars shipped in compared with other this segment s gross voyage profit before depreciation decreased million as a result of the discontinuation of the previous four vessel us flag lash liner service  which decreased the results of certain of the company s specialized subsidiaries 
vessel and barge depreciation vessel and barge depreciation decreased from million in to million in primarily due to the reclassification of the us flag lash liner service  cape size bulk carrier  and certain special purpose barges to assets held for disposal in june of  and subsequent sale of most of these assets  as described later in the impairment loss on assets held for disposal section 
the lease transactions related to the pctcs discussed earlier in the gross voyage profit time charter contracts section and the sale for scrap during of two of the company s lash vessels previously chartered to the msc also contributed to this decrease 
other income and expenses administrative and general expenses decreased from million in to million in primarily due to savings resulting from the staff reductions discussed later in the impairment loss on assets held for disposal section  slightly offset by related severance payments 
additionally  the company retained an unrelated third party during to provide ship management services that were previously provided by a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
the costs for these services of approximately million were included in voyage expenses in while the expenses of the subsidiary were included in administrative and general expenses in gain on sale of vessels and other assets of  in primarily related to the sale of certain contract rights that were no longer beneficial to the company and the sale of other assets no longer needed for operations 
the net gain of million in was related to gains on the sale of one of the company s pctcs  which was replaced by a newer pctc  and the sale of additional contract rights no longer required by the company  partially offset by a loss on the sale of two of the company s lash vessels  which completed their commitment under charter with the msc and were no longer needed for operations interest expense decreased from million in to million in the early repayment of the debt associated with the two pctcs sold and leased back during under operating leases  and the reclassification of another pctc lease from a capital lease to an operating lease due to a change in lease terms accounted for approximately million of the decrease 
regularly scheduled payments on outstanding debt and lower interest rates contributed million to the decrease 
additionally  interest expense decreased because the company s line of credit had a lower balance drawn throughout as compared to  and the company repurchased million of its senior notes and million of its senior notes during these decreases were partially offset by interest incurred during on the financing of a new pctc purchased in the second half of  additional financing on the company s molten sulphur carrier in july of  and new financing on two of the company s lash vessels in november of impairment loss on investment of  in resulted from a write down of an investment in a norwegian shipping company

liner service this segment s gross voyage profit before depreciation and impairment loss decreased million  which resulted from the waterman service that had out of service days from unplanned maintenance on two of its vessels and scheduling realignments as a result of those unplanned maintenance periods 
in addition  the service experienced a drop in its inbound tonnage volume as a result of market conditions 
contracts of affreightment this segment had a drop in its gross voyage profit of million reflecting the change in one of the company s contracts  the freeport indonesian service  which resulted in the contract being accounted for in the time charters contract segment in for the year  this segment included a contract for a molten sulphur carrier and the freeport indonesian service contract 
for the year  this segment only included the contract for the molten sulphur carrier 
time charter contracts this segment  excluding the results from the above reclassification  decreased million resulting from the completion of charters to the msc for four of the company s vessels 
three of these vessels were at the end of their economic lives and were scrapped in march  may  and july of  and the other vessel is under an operating lease agreement now employed in the freeport indonesian service 
the three ro ro vessels  operating under charter with the msc  had fewer operating days in as a result of required drydockings 
the freeport indonesian service contract which previously included two float on float off spv s  along with one container breakbulk vessel now includes one of the vessels previously chartered to the msc  a small tanker and two container vessels 
in the beginning of  the two spvs previously employed in this trade were modified to enable them to carry standard gauge railroad cars and are now employed in the mexican service  included below in the rail ferry service segment

this vessel completed its commitment under charter with the msc  reached the end of its economic life  and was sold for scrap 
the impairment loss on the us and foreign flag lash service was measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeded its estimated fair value 
the fair value of the foreign flag lash service assets was estimated by determining the present value of its expected future cash flows using a discount rate believed to be commensurate with the company s borrowing rate 
the impairment loss on the us flag lash on charter to msc was measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the vessel exceeded its estimated fair value at time of sale

the fair value of the company s cash and short term investment portfolio at december   approximated carrying value due to its short term duration 
the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates at year end for the company s investment portfolio is not material 
the fair value of long term debt  including current maturities  was estimated to be million compared to a carrying value of million 
the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in the borrowing rates applicable to the company s long term debt at december   would be approximately million or of the carrying value 
the company entered into two interest rate swap agreements with commercial banks  one in december of and another in september of  in order to reduce the possible impact of higher interest rates in the long term market by utilizing the fixed rate available with the swap 
in august of  the company terminated its swap agreement entered into in december of for the remaining agreement  the fixed rate payor is the company  and the floating rate payor is the commercial bank

while this arrangement is structured to reduce the company s exposure to increases in fuel prices  it also limits the benefit the company might otherwise receive from any price decreases associated with this commodity 
the fair value of these agreements at december   estimated based on the difference between year end price per ton of fuel and the contract delivery price per ton of fuel times the quantity applicable to the agreements  is an asset of  a hypothetical decrease in the fuel prices as of december  would have resulted in a  decrease in the fair value of the asset
