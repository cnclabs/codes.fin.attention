these risks include the fact that the market for e learning products and services is in the early stages of development and may not grow to a sufficient size or at a sufficient rate to sustain the company s business 
the company also faces intense competition from other e learning providers and may be unable to compete successfully 
many of the company s existing and potential competitors have longer operating histories and significantly greater financial  technical and other resources and therefore may be able to more quickly respond to changing opportunities or customer requirements 
new competitors are also likely to enter this market in the future due to the lack of significant barrier to entry in the market share

management s plan with regard to these matters include continued development  marketing and licensing of its e learning products and services

the company s service agreements with affiliated dental practices nearly all terminated during fiscal which will reduce revenues and cash flow from this source and accordingly could negatively affect the company s liquidity and operating results 
during fiscal and fiscal  the company received million and million respectively  in cash from terminating the service agreements with affiliated practices 
these cash collections accelerate the date at which the company will be required to sustain its operations solely on cash collections derived from e learning revenues

the preparation of these financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the more significant areas requiring use of estimates relate to revenue recognition  accounts receivable and notes receivable valuation reserves  realizability of intangible assets  realizability of deferred income tax assets  and the evaluation of contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of such estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company s service revenue is primarily comprised of custom content service contracts  web hosting services  and software support and services 
for contracts and revenues related exclusively to custom content services  the company recognizes revenue and profit as work progresses on custom content service contracts using the percentage of completion method  which relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs 
the company follows this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the costs applicable to various stages of a custom content service contract can be made 
recognized revenues and profit are subject to revisions as the custom content service contract progresses to completion 
revisions in profit estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
customers sometimes request modifications to projects in progress which may result in significant revisions to cost estimates and profit recognition  and the company may not be successful in negotiating additional payments related to the changes in scope of requested services 
provisions for any estimated losses on uncompleted custom content service contracts are made in the period in which such losses become evident 
there were no such losses at march  for custom content service 
in connection with the company s sales of software licenses in fiscal  the company adopted statement of position sop as issued by the american institute of certified public accountants 
in accordance with sop  the company recognizes revenue from the sale of software licenses if all of the following conditions are met o there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement with the customer  o the product has been delivered to the customer  o collection of the fees is probable  and o the amount of the fees to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable 
for arrangements requiring customer acceptance  revenue is deferred until the earlier of the end of the acceptance period or until written notice of acceptance is received from the customer 
we consider all arrangements with payment terms longer than normal not to be fixed or determinable 
for arrangements involving extended payment terms  revenue recognition occurs when payments are due and collection is probable 
the company has engaged organizations that market and sell its products and services through their sales distribution channels and are generally either referral partners  var s or oem distributors 
the company s distribution agreements typically have terms of one to three years and are automatically renewed for an additional like term unless either party terminates the agreement for breach or other financial reasons 
in most of these agreements  the distribution partner purchases the product from the company and resells the product to their customers 
under those agreements  the company records only the amount paid by the distributor as revenue and recognizes revenue when all revenue recognition criteria have been met 
the company executes contracts that govern the terms and conditions of each software license  maintenance and support and other services arrangements 
these contracts may be elements in a multiple element arrangement 
revenue under multiple element arrangements  which may include several different software products and services sold together  is allocated to each element based on the residual method in accordance with sop support and hosting revenue is recognized ratably over the support term  typically months  and revenues related to implementation  consulting  education and other services are generally recognized as the services are performed 
although the company may provide implementation and consulting services on a time and materials basis  a significant portion of these services have been provided on a fixed fee basis 
the company has embarked upon a new strategy focusing on e learning 
prior to the transition  the company operated as a dental practice management company 
under the terms of the modified service agreements with the affiliated practices  the company recognizes revenue ratably over the terms of the service agreement 
the company is no longer being reimbursed for expenses paid on the practices behalf 
as a result  the components of net revenues have changed with the new management services agreements resulting in a reduction in reported service agreement revenues and related dental operating expenses 
software development costs the company accounts for software development costs in accordance with statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  whereby costs for the development of new software products and substantial enhancements to existing software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established  at which time any additional costs are capitalized 
technological feasibility is established upon completion of a working model 
costs of maintenance and customer support are charged to expense when related revenue is recognized or when those costs are incurred  whichever occurs first 
software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility have not been significant to date  and all software development costs have been charged to research and development expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost 
depreciation is provided using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the various classes of depreciable assets 
during fiscal  the company changed the estimated useful life on certain classes of its property and equipment to more accurately reflect the change in the company s business 
the following classes of depreciable assets were changed as follows furniture fixtures from years to years equipment from years to years computer equipment from years to years leasehold improvements shorter of years or lease term intangible assets on april   the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets and as a result  the company s goodwill is no longer amortized 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill be tested annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise for impairment 
upon initial application of sfas no 
 the company determined there was no impairment of goodwill 
the company has established the date of march on which to value its goodwill 
the company has made acquisitions of companies having operations or technology in areas within its strategic focus and has recorded goodwill and other intangible assets associated with its acquisitions 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the underlying acquired operations could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the goodwill and other intangible assets thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
as of march   the company has identified no such impairment 
debt issuance costs are amortized using the effective interest rate method over the ten year term of the related debt obligations 
other intangibles primarily consist of the quisic and learnlinc purchase consideration that was allocated to purchased software and customer relationship intangibles 
such other intangible are amortized over their expected benefit period of twenty four to thirty six months 
long lived assets the company reviews for the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the carrying amount of a long lived asset is considered impaired when anticipated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount 
concentration of credit risk accounts receivable and notes receivables represent services rendered by the company for e learning customers and the affiliated practices 
the company does not perform periodic credit reports or receive collateral related to the receivables 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its affiliated practices and customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s practices and customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
income taxes the company utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred taxes are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted marginal tax rates currently in effect when the differences reverse 
the company has recorded a full valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of its net deferred tax assets because it has concluded that it is not likely it will be recognized due to the lack of operating history and implementation of its e learning business plan and the modification of its management service agreements 
the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
in the event the company was to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such a determination was made 
stock based compensation the company has adopted sfas no

the company provides a day warranty for certain of its products 
historically  the company s performance under the warranty has been minimal  and as such  no warranty accrual has been provided for in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
under its bylaws  the company has agreed to indemnify its officers and directors for certain events or occurrences arising as a result of the officer or director s serving in such capacity 
the term of the indemnification period is for the officer s or director s lifetime 
the maximum potential amount of future payments the company could be required to make under these indemnification agreements is unlimited 
however  the company has a directors and officer liability insurance policy that limits its exposure and enables it to recover a portion of any future amounts paid 
as a result of its insurance policy coverage  the company believes the estimated fair value of these indemnification agreements is minimal and has no liabilities recorded for these agreements as of march  the company enters into indemnification provisions under i its agreements with other companies in its ordinary course of business  typically with business partners  contractors  and customers  landlords and ii its agreements with investors 
under these provisions the company generally indemnifies and hold harmless the indemnified party for losses suffered or incurred by the indemnified party as a result of the company s activities or  in some cases  as a result of the indemnified party s activities under the agreement 
the maximum potential amount of future payments the company could be required to make under these indemnification provisions is unlimited 
the company has not incurred material costs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification agreements

additional risk factors that may affect our operating results and the market price of our common stock you should carefully consider the risks described below 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
in that case  the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected 
we have a limited operating history  which makes it difficult to evaluate our business 
we have a limited operating history in the e learning business and particularly as a provider of web conferencing and web collaboration software 
while the organizations that we have acquired have been engaged in the e learning business for over ten years  we only recently acquired those assets and you should not rely on our historical results as an indication of our future performance 
over the past months we have made significant changes to our product mix and service mix  our growth strategies  our sales and marketing plans  and other operational matters  including a significant reduction in our employee base 
as a result  it may be difficult to evaluate an investment in our company  and we cannot be certain that our business model and future operating performance will yield the results that we intend 
in addition  the competitive and rapidly changing nature of the e learning and web conferencing markets makes it difficult for us to predict future results 
our business strategy may be unsuccessful and we may be unable to address the risks we face 
the company faces risks encountered by early stage companies in internet related businesses and may be unsuccessful in addressing these risks 
the company faces risks frequently encountered by early stage companies in new and rapidly evolving markets 
specific risks the company faces relate to the demand for e learning products and services  and broad and timely acceptance of the company s e learning products and services 
the company may fail to adequately address these risks and  as a consequence  its business may suffer 
to address these risks  the company must o successfully introduce and attract new customers to its e learning products  o successfully implement its sales and marketing strategy to generate sufficient revenues to sustain operations  o foster existing relationships its customers to provide for continued or recurring business  and o successfully address and establish new products and technologies 
the company s quarterly operating results are uncertain and may fluctuate significantly 
the company s operating results have varied significantly from quarter to quarter and are likely to continue to fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors  many of which the company cannot control 
factors that may adversely affect the company s quarterly operating results include o the size and timing of product orders  o the mix of revenue from custom services and software products  o the market acceptance of the company s products and services  o the company s ability to develop and market new products in a timely manner and the market acceptance of these new products  o the timing of revenues and expenses relating to the company s product sales  and  o the timing of revenue recognition 
expense levels are based  in part  on expectations as to future revenue and to a large extent are fixed in the short term 
to the extent the company is unable to predict future revenue accurately  the company may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
we have significant operating losses and have limited financial resources we have incurred substantial operating losses and have limited financial resources at our disposal 
we have substantial current and long term obligations that we will not be able to satisfy without additional debt and or equity capital and ultimately generating profits and cash flows from our e learning operations 
as we transition from the management of dental practices  from which we received substantial cash flows during the past two years  to being a provider of e learning services  we will need to show growth and financial improvement in our e learning operating segment 
we may not be successful in raising additional debt or equity capital and may not become profitable in our e learning business 
as a result  we may not have sufficient financial resources to satisfy our obligations as they come due in the near term 
our auditors have expressed substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern our consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a basis which assumes that we will continue as a going concern and which contemplates the realization of our assets and the satisfaction of our liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business 
the company has a significant working capital deficiency  and has suffered substantial recurring losses and negative cash flows from operations 
also  the company s management service agreements with the affiliated dental practices nearly all expired during fiscal and will continue to expire through december   which will reduce revenues and cash flows from this source and accordingly will negatively affect the company s liquidity and operating results 
these matters  among others  and the limited operating history as an e learning company  caused our independent accountants to express their substantial doubt about as to our ability to continue as a going concern 
your ownership interest in the company will be diluted upon issuance of shares we have reserved for future issuance on march    shares of our common stock were outstanding  of which  were held in treasury  and  additional shares of our common stock were reserved for issuance 
the issuance of these additional shares will reduce your percentage ownership in the company 
the following shares were reserved for issuance as of march  o issued and outstanding stock options to purchase shares totaling approximately  o issued and outstanding warrants to purchase shares totaling approximately  o a restricted stock grant to receive shares totaling approximately o shares issuable upon the conversion of convertible redeemable subordinated notes totaling approximately  and o shares issuable upon the conversion of convertible series a subordinated notes totaling approximately  the existence of these reserved shares coupled with other factors  such as the relatively small public float  could adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock and our ability to raise capital through an offering of equity securities 
the loss of the services of the company s senior executives and key personnel would likely cause the company s business to suffer 
the company s success depends to a significant degree on the performance of the senior management team listed elsewhere in this memorandum 
the loss of any of these individuals could harm the company s business 
the company does not maintain key person life insurance for any officers or key employees other than james powers 
the company s success also depends on its ability to attract  integrate  motivate and retain additional highly skilled technical  sales and marketing  and professional services personnel 
to the extent the company is unable to attract and retain a sufficient number of additional skilled personnel  the company s business will suffer 
the company s intellectual property may become subject to legal challenges  unauthorized use or infringement  any of which could diminish the value of its products and services 
the company s success depends in large part on its proprietary technology 
if the company fails to successfully enforce its intellectual property rights  the value of these rights  and consequently the value of its products and services to its customers  could diminish substantially 
it may be possible for third parties to copy or otherwise obtain and use its intellectual property or trade secrets without the company s authorization  and it may also be possible for third parties to independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property 
currently  the company does not have patent protection in place related to its products and services 
litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce the company s intellectual property rights  to protect trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
from time to time the company has received  and may in the future receive  notice of claims of infringement of other parties proprietary rights 
such claims could result in costly litigation and could divert management and technical resources 
these types of claims could also delay product shipment or require the company to develop non infringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements  which agreements  if required  may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all 
a deterioration of general economic conditions may materially and adversely affect the company s business 
the company s revenues are subject to fluctuation as a result of general economic conditions 
the company s customers may reduce their expenditures for education and training during economic downturns 
therefore  a continued economic downturn could adversely affect the company s business 
we offer our web collaboration products on an asp basis so if we do not increase the capacity of our infrastructure in excess of customer demand  customers may experience service problems 
we expect the demand on our asp business to increase significantly 
accordingly  we must increase our capacity to keep pace with that growth in demand 
to accommodate increased customer usage requires a significant increase in the capacity of our infrastructure and may cause us to invest significant resources or capital 
if we fail to increase our capacity in a timely and efficient manner  customers may experience service problems that could cause us to lose customers and decrease our revenue 
competition in the web conferencing services market is intense and we may be unable to compete successfully  particularly as a result of recent announcements from large software companies 
the market for web conferencing services is relatively new  rapidly evolving and intensely competitive 
competition in our market will continue to intensify and may force us to reduce our prices  or cause us to experience reduced sales and margins  loss of market share and reduced acceptance of our services 
many of our competitors have larger and more established customer bases  longer operating histories  greater name recognition  broader service offerings  more employees and significantly greater financial  technical  marketing  public relations and distribution resources than we do 
we expect that we will face new competition as others enter our market to develop web conferencing services 
these current and future competitors may also offer or develop products or services that perform better than ours 
in addition  acquisitions or strategic partnerships involving our current and potential competitors could harm us in a number of ways 
future regulations could be enacted that either directly restrict our business or indirectly impact our business by limiting the growth of internet based business and services 
as commercial use of the internet increases  federal  state and foreign agencies could enact laws or adopt regulations covering issues such as user privacy  content and taxation of products and services 
if enacted  such laws or regulations could limit the market for our products and services 
although they might not apply to our business directly  we expect that laws or rules regulating personal and consumer information could indirectly affect our business 
it is possible that such legislation or regulation could expose companies involved in providing internet based services to liability  which could limit the growth of web use generally and thereby reduce demand for our products and services 
such legislation or regulation could dampen the growth in web usage and decrease its acceptance as a medium of communications and commerce 
we depend largely on one time sales to grow revenues 
a high percentage of our revenue is attributable to one time purchases by our customers rather than long term recurring contracts 
as a result  our inability to continue to obtain new agreements and sales may result in lower than expected revenue  and therefore  harm our ability to sustain operations or profitability on a consistent basis  which could also cause our stock price to decline 
further  because we face competition from larger better capitalized companies  we could face increased downward pricing pressure that could cause a decrease in our gross margins 
our operating results may suffer if we fail to develop and foster or value added reseller or distribution relationships 
we have an existing channel and distribution network that provides growing revenues and contributes to our high margin software sales 
these distribution partners are not obligated to distribute our services at any particular minimum level 
as a result  we cannot accurately predict the amount of revenue we will derive from our distribution partners in the future 
our inability of our distribution partners to sell our products to their customers and increase their distribution of our products could result in significant reductions in our revenue  and therefore  harm our ability to sustain profitability on a consistent basis 
the growth of our business substantially depends on our ability to successfully develop and introduce new services and features in a timely manner 
we acquired our web collaboration  web conferencing and virtual classroom software in november of with our focus upon that product suite our growth depends on our ability to continue to develop new features  products and services around that suite and line of products 
we may not successfully identify  develop and market new products and features in a timely and cost effective manner 
if we fail to develop and maintain market acceptance of our existing and new products to offset our continuing development costs  then our net losses will increase and we may not be able to sustain profitability on a consistent basis 
if we fail to offer competitive pricing  we may not be able to attract and retain customers 
because the web conferencing market is relatively new and still evolving  the prices for these services are subject to rapid and frequent changes 
in many cases  businesses provide their services at significantly reduced rates  for free or on a trial basis in order to win customers 
due to competitive factors and the rapidly changing marketplace  we may be required to significantly reduce our pricing structure  which would negatively affect our revenue  margins and our ability to sustain profitability on a consistent basis 
we have an existing channel and distribution network that provides growing revenues and contributes to our high margin software sales 
these distribution partners are not obligated to distribute our services at any particular minimum level 
as a result  we cannot accurately predict the amount of revenue we will derive from our distribution partners in the future 
our inability of our distribution partners to sell our products to their customers and increase their distribution of our products could result in significant reductions in our revenue  and therefore  harm our ability to sustain profitability on a consistent basis 
our international distributor network may cause costs that are not anticipated 
we continue to expand internationally through our value added reseller network and oem partners 
we have limited experience in international operations and may not be able to compete effectively in international markets 
we face certain risks inherent in conducting business internationally  such as our inability to establishing and maintain effective distribution channels and partners  the varying technology standards from country to country  our inability to effectively protect our intellectual property rights or the code to our software  our inexperience with inconsistent regulations and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements in foreign jurisdictions  language and cultural differences  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  our inability to effectively collecting accounts receivable  or our inability to manage sales and other taxes imposed by foreign jurisdictions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates  equity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from the potential change in the value of a financial instrument as a result of fluctuations in interest rates and market prices 
we have not traded or otherwise bought and sold derivatives nor do we expect to in the future 
we also do not invest in market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
the primary objective of the company s investment activity is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  the company maintains its portfolio of cash equivalents in a variety of money market funds 
as of march   the carrying value of our outstanding convertible redeemable subordinated notes was approximately million at a fixed interest rate of 
in certain circumstances  we may redeem this long term debt 
our other components of indebtness bear fixed interest rates of to 
because the interest rates on these instruments are fixed  a hypothetical change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our financial condition  revenues or operations 
increases in interest rates could  however  increase the interest expense associated with future borrowings  if any 
we do not hedge against interest rate increases
