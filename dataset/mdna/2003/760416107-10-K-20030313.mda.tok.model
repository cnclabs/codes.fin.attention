risks and uncertainties and certain significant estimates the earnings of the company depend on the earnings of the banks 
the banks are dependent primarily upon the level of net interest income  which is the difference between interest earned on its interest earning assets  such as loans and investments  and the interest paid on its interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
accordingly  the operations of the banks are subject to risks and uncertainties surrounding their exposure to change in the interest rate environment 
prepayments on residential real estate mortgages and other fixed rate loans and mortgage backed securities may cause significant fluctuations in interest margins 
fbd began to offer short term consumer loans through the delaware bank in at december   there were approximately million of short term consumer loans outstanding  which were originated in texas  california  georgia  and north carolina through a small number of marketers 
these loans generally have principal amounts of  or less and terms of approximately two weeks 
legislation eliminating  or limiting interest rates upon short term consumer loans has from time to time been proposed  primarily as a result of fee levels which approximate per borrowed  for two week terms 
if such proposals cease  a larger number of competitors may begin offering the product  and increased competition could result in lower fees 
further  fbd uses a small number of marketers under contracts which can be terminated upon short notice  under various circumstances 
the impact of negative conditions influencing the above factors  if any  is not possible to predict 
after a hiatus  fbd began offering two tax refund products in with liberty tax service 
liberty tax service is a nationwide professional tax service provider which prepares and electronically files federal and state income tax returns tax refund products 
tax refund products consist of accelerated check refunds acrs  and refund anticipation loans rals 
the company realized revenues of  and  in the years and respectively for the program 
there can be no assurances that revenues will continue to grow or be maintained at current levels in future periods 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america require management to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant estimates are made by management in determining the allowance for loan losses  carrying values of other real estate owned  and income taxes 
consideration is given to a variety of factors in establishing these estimates 
in estimating the allowance for loan losses  management considers current economic conditions  diversification of the loan portfolio  delinquency statistics  results of internal loan reviews  borrowers perceived financial and managerial strengths  the adequacy of underlying collateral  if collateral dependent  or present value of future cash flows and other relevant factors 
since the allowance for loan losses and carrying value of real estate owned are dependent  to a great extent  on the general economy and other conditions that may be beyond the banks control  it is at least reasonably possible that the estimates of the allowance for loan losses and the carrying values of the real estate owned could differ materially in the near term 
the company and its subsidiaries are subject to federal and state regulations governing virtually all aspects of their activities  including but not limited to  lines of business  liquidity  investments  the payment of dividends  and others 
such regulations and the cost of adherence to such regulations can have a significant impact on earnings and financial condition 
republic first bancorp commitments  contingencies and concentrations the company is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
these instruments involve to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the financial statements 
credit risk is defined as the possibility of sustaining a loss due to the failure of the other parties to a financial instrument to perform in accordance with the terms of the contract 
the maximum exposure to credit loss under commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amount of these instruments 
the company uses the same underwriting standards and policies in making credit commitments as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
financial instruments whose contract amounts represent potential credit risk are commitments to extend credit of approximately million and million and standby letters of credit of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
the million of commitments to extend credit at december   were substantially all variable rate commitments 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and many require the payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained upon extension of credit is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer 
collateral held varies but may include real estate  marketable securities  pledged deposits  equipment and accounts receivable 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued that guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
the credit risk and collateral policy involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan commitments 
the amount of collateral obtained is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer 
collateral held varies but may include real estate  marketable securities  pledged deposits  equipment and accounts receivable 
contractual obligations and other commitments the following table sets forth contractual obligations and other commitments representing required and potential cash outflows as of december  one to four to after less than three five five total one year years years years dollars in thousands minimum annual rentals or noncancellable operating leases    remaining contractual maturities of time deposits     contingent liabilities on equipment benefit plans  loan commitments     long term borrowed funds   standby letters of credit   total      as of december   the company had entered into non cancelable lease agreements for its main office and operations center  seven republic first bank retail branch facilities and two first bank of delaware branches  expiring through august  the leases are accounted for as operating leases

the company has entered into employment agreements with the president of the company and the president of the bank 
the aggregate commitment for future salaries and benefits under these employment agreements at december  is approximately million 
the company and the banks are from time to time a party plaintiff or defendant to lawsuits that are in the normal course of business 
while any litigation involves an element of uncertainty  management  after reviewing pending actions with its legal counsel  is of the opinion that the liability of the company and the banks  if any  resulting from such actions will not have a material effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the company and the banks 
at december   the company had no foreign loans and no loan concentrations exceeding of total loans except for credits extended to real estate operators and lessors in the aggregate amount of million  which represented of gross loans receivable at december  various types of real estate are included in this category  including industrial  retail shopping centers  office space  residential multi family and others 
loan concentrations are considered to exist when there is amounts loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar activities that management believes would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions 
interest rate risk management interest rate risk management involves managing the extent to which interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities are matched 
the company attempts to optimize net interest income while managing period to period fluctuations therein 
the company typically defines interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities as those that reprice within one year or less 
the difference between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities is known as the interest sensitivity gap gap 
a positive gap occurs when interest sensitive assets exceed interest sensitive liabilities repricing in the same time periods  and a negative gap occurs when interest sensitive liabilities exceed interest sensitive assets repricing in the same time periods 
a negative gap ratio suggests that a financial institution may be better positioned to take advantage of declining interest rates rather than increasing interest rates  and a positive gap ratio suggests the converse 
static gap analysis describes interest rate sensitivity at a point in time 
however  it alone does not accurately measure the magnitude of changes in net interest income since changes in interest rates do not impact all categories of assets and liabilities equally or simultaneously 
interest rate sensitivity analysis also requires assumptions about repricing certain categories of assets and liabilities 
for purposes of interest rate sensitivity analysis  assets and liabilities are stated at either their contractual maturity  estimated likely call date  or earliest repricing opportunity 
mortgage backed securities and amortizing loans are scheduled based on their anticipated cash flow  including prepayments based on historical data and current market trends 
savings  money market and interest bearing demand accounts do not have a stated maturity or repricing term and can be withdrawn or repriced at any time 
management estimates the repricing characteristics of these accounts based on historical performance and other deposit behavior assumptions 
these deposits are not considered to reprice simultaneously  and accordingly  a portion of the deposits are moved into time brackets exceeding one year 
however  management may choose not to reprice liabilities proportionally to changes in market interest rates  for competitive or other reasons 
shortcomings  inherent in a simplified and static gap analysis  may result in an institution with a negative gap having interest rate behavior associated with an asset sensitive balance sheet 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
furthermore  repricing characteristics of certain assets and liabilities may vary substantially within a given time period 
in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayments and other cash flows could also deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating gap in the manner presented in the table below 
the company attempts to manage its assets and liabilities in a manner that optimizes net interest income in a range of interest rate environments 
management uses gap analysis and simulation models to monitor behavior of its interest sensitive assets and liabilities 
adjustments to the mix of assets and liabilities are made periodically in an effort to provide steady growth in net interest income 
republic first bancorp management presently believes that the effect on the banks of any future fall in interest rates  reflected in lower yielding assets  would be detrimental since the banks do not have the immediate ability to commensurately decrease rates on its interest bearing liabilities  primarily time deposits  other borrowings and certain transaction accounts 
an increase in interest rates could have a positive effect on the banks  due to repricing of certain assets  primarily adjustable rate loans and federal funds sold  and a possible lag in the repricing of core deposits not assumed in the model 
the following tables present a summary of the company s interest rate sensitivity gap at december  for purposes of these tables  the company has used assumptions based on industry data and historical experience to calculate the expected maturity of loans because  statistically  certain categories of loans are prepaid before their maturity date  even without regard to interest rate fluctuations 
additionally  certain prepayment assumptions were made with regard to investment securities based upon the expected prepayment of the underlying collateral of the mortgage backed securities 
the interest rate on the trust preferred securities is variable and adjusts semi annually

in addition to the gap analysis  the company utilizes income simulation modeling in measuring its interest rate risk and managing its interest rate sensitivity 
income simulation considers not only the impact of changing market interest rates on republic first bancorp forecasted net interest income  but also other factors such a yield curve relationships  the volume and mix of assets and liabilities and general market conditions 
through the use of income simulation modeling the company has estimated net interest income for the year ending december   based upon the assets  liabilities and off balance sheet financial instruments at december  the company has also estimated changes to that estimated net interest income based upon immediate and sustained changes in interest rates rate shocks 
rate shocks assume that all of the interest rate increases or decreases occur on the first day of the period modeled and remain at that level for the entire period 
the following table reflects the estimated percentage change in estimated net interest income for the years ending december percent change rate shocks to interest rates the company s management believes that the assumptions utilized in evaluating the company s estimated net interest income are reasonable  however  the interest rate sensitivity of the company s assets  liabilities and off balance sheet financial instruments as well as the estimated effect of changes in interest rates on estimated net interest income could vary substantially if different assumptions are used or actual experience differs from the experience on which the assumptions were based 
prepayments on residential mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities have increased over historical levels due to the lower interest rate environment and may result in reductions in margins 
capital resources the company is required to comply with certain risk based capital adequacy guidelines issued by the frb and the fdic 
the risk based capital guidelines assign varying risk weights to the individual assets held by a bank 
the guidelines also assign weights to the credit equivalent amounts of certain off balance sheet items  such as letters of credit and interest rate and currency swap contracts 
under these guidelines  banks are expected to meet a minimum target ratio for qualifying total capital to weighted risk assets of  at least one half of which is to be in the form of tier capital 
qualifying total capital is divided into two separate categories or tiers 
tier capital includes common stockholders equity  certain qualifying perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries  less goodwill  tier capital components limited in the aggregate to one half of total qualifying capital includes allowances for credit losses within limits  certain excess levels of perpetual preferred stock and certain types of hybrid capital instruments  subordinated debt and other preferred stock 
applying the federal guidelines  the ratio of qualifying total capital to weighted risk assets  was and at december   and  respectively  and as required by the guidelines  at least one half of the qualifying total capital consisted of tier l capital elements 
tier l risk based capital ratios on december  and were and  respectively 
at december   and  the company exceeded the requirements for risk based capital adequacy under both federal and pennsylvania state guidelines 
under frb and fdic regulations  a bank is deemed to be well capitalized when it has a leverage ratio tier l capital to total assets of at least  a tier l capital to weighted risk assets ratio of at least  and a total capital to weighted risk assets ratio of at least 
at december   and  the company s leverage ratio was and  respectively 
accordingly  at december  and  the company was considered well capitalized under frb and fdic regulations 
on november   republic first bancorp  inc  through a pooled offering with sandler o neill partners  issued million of corporation obligated mandatorily redeemable capital securities of the subsidiary trust holding solely junior subordinated debentures of the corporation more commonly known as trust preferred securities 
the purpose of the issuance was to increase capital as a result of the company s continued loan and core deposit growth 
the trust preferred securities qualify as tier capital for regulatory purposes in amounts up to of total tier capital 
the company may call the securities on any interest payment date after five years  without a prepayment penalty  notwithstanding their final year maturity 
the interest rate is variable and adjustable semi annually at over the month london interbank offered rate libor 
the shareholders equity of the company as of december   totaled approximately million compared to approximately million as of december  this increase of million was substantially all attributable to net republic first bancorp income for the year of approximately million and a net of tax improvement in the unrealized gain on securities of million 
these factors also increased the book value per share of the company s common stock  which increased from as of december   based upon  shares outstanding  to as of december   based upon  shares outstanding at december  the increase was primarily attributable to net income for the year and the improvement in the market value of available for sale securities 
regulatory capital requirements federal banking agencies impose three minimum capital requirements on the company s risk based capital ratios based on total capital  tier capital  and a leverage capital ratio 
the risk based capital ratios measure the adequacy of a bank s capital against the riskiness of its assets and off balance sheet activities 
failure to maintain adequate capital is a basis for prompt corrective action or other regulatory enforcement action 
in assessing a bank s capital adequacy  regulators also consider other factors such as interest rate risk exposure  liquidity  funding and market risks  quality and level or earnings  concentrations of credit  quality of loans and investments  risks of any nontraditional activities  effectiveness of bank policies  and management s overall ability to monitor and control risks

  management believes that the company and banks meet as of december   and  all capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject 
as of december   the most recent notification from the federal reserve bank categorized the bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action provisions of the federal deposit insurance act 
there are no calculations or events since that notification  that management believes would have changed the banks category 
republic first bancorp the company and the banks ability to maintain the required levels of capital is substantially dependent upon the success of their capital and business plans  the impact of future economic events on the banks loan customers and the banks ability to manage their interest rate risk  growth and other operating expenses 
in addition to the above minimum capital requirements  the federal reserve bank approved a rule that became effective on december   implementing a statutory requirement that federal banking regulators take specified prompt corrective action when an insured institution s capital level falls below certain levels 
the rule defines five capital categories based on several of the above capital ratios 
the banks currently exceed the levels required for a bank to be classified as well capitalized 
however  the federal reserve bank may consider other criteria when determining such classifications  which criteria could result in a downgrading in such classifications 
the company s equity to assets ratio increased from as of december   to as of december  the increase at year end was a result of the improvement in net income and an improvement in the market value of available for sale securities 
the company s average equity to assets ratio for  and was  and  respectively 
the company s average return on equity for  and was   and  respectively  and its average return on assets for   and  was   and  respectively 
liquidity financial institutions must maintain liquidity to meet day to day requirements of depositors and borrowers  time investment purchases to market conditions and provide a cushion against unforeseen needs 
liquidity needs can be met by either reducing assets or increasing liabilities 
the most liquid assets consist of cash  amounts due from banks and federal funds sold 
regulatory authorities require the company to maintain certain liquidity ratios such that the banks maintain available funds  or can obtain available funds at reasonable rates  in order to satisfy commitments to borrowers and the demands of depositors 
in response to these requirements  the company has formed an asset liability committee alco  comprised of certain members of the banks board of directors and senior management  which monitors such ratios 
the purpose of the committee is  in part  to monitor the banks liquidity and adherence to the ratios in addition to managing relative interest rate risk 
the alco meets at least quarterly 
the company s most liquid assets totaled million at december   compared to million at december  due primarily to an increase in federal funds sold 
loan maturities and repayments are another source of asset liquidity 
at december   the bank estimated that in excess of million of loans would mature or repay in the six month period ended june  additionally  the majority of its securities are available to satisfy liquidity requirements through pledges to the fhlb to access the banks line of credit 
funding requirements have historically been satisfied by generating core deposits and certificates of deposit with competitive rates  buying federal funds or utilizing the facilities of the federal home loan bank system fhlb 
at december   the bank had million in unused lines of credit available under arrangements with the fhlb and with correspondent banks  compared to million at december  the reduction in available lines resulted from prepayments of the bank s mortgage backed securities and loans pledged as collateral against those lines 
notwithstanding these reductions  management believes it satisfactorily exceeds regulatory liquidity guidelines 
these lines of credit enable the bank to purchase funds for short to long term needs at rates often lower than other sources and require pledging of securities or loan collateral 
at december   the company had outstanding commitments including unused lines of credit and letters of credit of million 
certificates of deposit scheduled to mature in one year totaled million at december   and no borrowings are scheduled to mature within that period 
the company anticipates that it will have sufficient funds available to meet its current commitments 
the bank has an additional million in other borrowings that are callable by the fhlb  whereupon they would be replaced by borrowings at then current rates and certificates of deposit 
if these borrowings are in fact called  net interest income could be affected 
in addition  the company can use overnight borrowings or other term borrowings to replace these borrowed funds 
the banks target and actual liquidity levels are determined by comparisons of the estimated repayment and marketability of the banks interest earning assets with projected future outflows of deposits and other liabilities 
the bank has established a line of credit from a correspondent to assist in managing the banks liquidity position 
that line of credit totaled million at december  the company had not drawn down on this line at december  additionally  the bank has established a line of credit with the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh with a maximum borrowing capacity of republic first bancorp approximately million 
as of december   and  the company had borrowed million and million  respectively  under its lines of credit 
investment securities represent a primary source of liquidity for the bank 
accordingly  investment decisions generally reflect liquidity over other considerations 
operating cash flows are primarily derived from cash provided from net income during the year and are another source of liquidity 
in  significant cash flows were provided from the maturities and principal paydowns of securities 
the company s primary short term funding sources are certificates of deposit and its securities portfolio 
the circumstances that are reasonably likely to affect those sources are as follows 
the bank has historically been able to generate certificates of deposit by matching philadelphia market rates or paying a premium rate of to basis points over those market rates 
it is anticipated that this source of liquidity will continue to be available  however  the incremental cost may vary depending on market conditions 
the company s securities portfolio is also available for liquidity  most likely as collateral for fhlb advances 
because of the fhlb s aaa rating  it is unlikely those advances would not be available 
but even if they are not  numerous investment companies would likely provide repurchase agreements up to the amount of the market value of the securities 
the banks alco is responsible for managing the liquidity position and interest sensitivity of the banks 
that committee s primary objective is to maximize net interest income while configuring the banks interest sensitive assets and liabilities to manage interest rate risk and provide adequate liquidity for projected needs 
investment securities portfolio the banks investment securities portfolio is intended to provide liquidity and contribute to earnings while diversifying credit risk 
the decline in securities in was a result of the company s strategy to reduce the amount of the investment securities portfolio and redeploy these assets into higher yielding commercial loans 
the lower interest rate environment also contributed to higher prepayments of mortgage backed securities  as these securities refinanced more rapidly than normal

a committee of the board of directors oversees the loan approval process to monitor that proper standards are maintained  while approving the majority of commercial loans 
loans  including impaired loans  are generally classified as non accrual if they are past due as to maturity or payment of interest or principal for a period of more than days  unless such loans are well secured and in the process of collection 
loans that are on a current payment status or past due less than days may also be classified as non accrual if repayment in full of principal and or interest is in doubt 
loans may be returned to accrual status when all principal and interest amounts contractually due are reasonably assured of repayment within an acceptable period of time  and there is a sustained period of repayment performance by the borrower  in accordance with the contractual terms 
while a loan is classified as non accrual or as an impaired loan and the future collectibility of the recorded loan balance is doubtful  collections of interest and principal are generally applied as a reduction to principal outstanding 
when the future collectibility of the recorded loan balance is expected  interest income may be recognized on a cash basis 
in the case where a non accrual loan had been partially charged off  recognition of interest on a cash basis is limited to that which would have been recognized on the recorded loan balance at the contractual interest rate 
cash interest receipts in excess of that amount are recorded as recoveries to the allowance for loan losses until prior charge offs have been fully recovered

problem loans consist of loans that are included in performing loans  but for which potential credit problems of the borrowers have caused management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to continue to comply with present repayment terms 
at december   all identified problem loans are included in the preceding table or are classified as substandard or doubtful  with a specific reserve allocation in the allowance for loan losses see allowance for loan losses 
management believes that the appraisals and other estimates of the value of the collateral pledged against the non accrual loans generally exceed the amount of its outstanding balances 
the following summary shows the impact on interest income of non accrual loans for the periods indicated for the year ended december  interest income that would have been recorded had the loans been in accordance with their original terms      interest income included in net income   at december   the company had no foreign loans and no loan concentrations exceeding of total loans except for credits extended to real estate operators and lessors in the aggregate amount of million  which represented of gross loans receivable at december  various types of real estate are included in this category  including industrial  retail shopping centers  office space  residential multi family and others 
loan concentrations are considered to exist when multiple number of borrowers are engaged in similar activities that management believes would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions

not including short term loan charge offs  ratios are and in and respectively 
the increase in commercial loan charge offs related primarily to charge offs for one borrower in the amount of million 
the remainder of this loan was subsequently transferred to other real estate owned with a value of  as discussed previously 
the increase in short term loan charge offs reflected the first full year offering of the product  which was in management makes at least a quarterly determination as to an appropriate provision from earnings to maintain an allowance for loan losses that is management s best estimate of known and inherent losses 
the company s board of directors periodically reviews the status of all non accrual and impaired loans and loans classified by the banks regulators or internal loan review officer  who reviews both the loan portfolio and overall adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the board of directors also considers specific loans  pools of similar loans  historical charge off activity  economic conditions and other relevant factors in reviewing the adequacy of the loan loss reserve 
any additions deemed necessary to the allowance for loan losses are charged to operating expenses 
the company has an existing loan review program  which monitors the loan portfolio on an ongoing basis 
loan review is conducted by a loan review officer who reports quarterly  directly to the board of directors 
estimating the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses at any given date is difficult  particularly in a continually changing economy 
in management s opinion  the allowance for loan losses was appropriate at december  however  there can be no assurance that  if asset quality deteriorates in future periods  additions to the allowance for loan losses will not be required 
republic first bancorp the banks management is unable to determine in what loan category future charge offs and recoveries may occur 
the following schedule sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan losses among various categories 
the allocation is based upon historical experience 
the entire allowance for loan losses is available to absorb loan losses in any loan category at december  dollars in thousands amount amount amount amount amount allocation of allowance for loan losses commercial      residential real estate consumer and other short term loans unallocated total      gross loans net of unearned income 
includes loans held for sale 
the methodology utilized to estimate the amount of the allowance for loan losses is as follows the company first applies an estimated loss percentage against all loan categories outstanding 
net charge offs excluding short term loans to average loans were and  respectively in and substantially all of such charge offs related to individual borrowers in each of those years 
in the previous three years  that ratio did not exceed 
in the absence of sustained charge off history  management estimates loss percentages based upon the purpose and or collateral of various commercial loan categories 
while such loss percentages exceed the percentages suggested by historical experience  the company maintained those percentages in additionally  in view of economic conditions  the bank increased the economic component of the estimated loss percentage 
the company applied historical loss percentages for consumer loans and short term consumer loans 
the company will continue to evaluate these percentages and may adjust these estimates on the basis of charge off history  economic conditions or other relevant factors 
the company also provides specific reserves for impaired loans to the extent the estimated realizable value of the underlying collateral is less than the loan balance  when the collateral is the only source of repayment 
further  the company attempts to classify any applicable loans according to regulatory definitions  for loans which may have characteristics which may decrease the probability of full compliance with original loan terms 
consistent with regulatory reserve allocations the classifications and percentage of principal which are allocated to the allowance for loan losses are as follows special mention  substandard  doubtful and loss 
also  the company may estimate and recognize reserve allocations above these regulatory reserve percentages based upon any factor which might impact the loss estimates 
those factors include but are not limited to the impact of economic conditions on the borrower and management s potential alternative strategies for loan or collateral disposition 
in  the unallocated component increased  to  primarily for economic reasons 
the unallocated allowance is established for losses which have not been identified through the formula and specific portions of the allowance described above 
the unallocated portion is more subjective and requires a high degree of management judgment and experience 
management has identified several factors that impact credit losses that are not considered in either the formula or the specific allowance segments 
these factors consist of industry and geographic loan concentrations  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  changes in underwriting processes and trends in problem loan and loss recovery rates 
the impact of the above is considered in light of management s conclusions as to the overall adequacy of underlying collateral and other factors 
the majority of the company s loan portfolio represents loans made for commercial purposes  while significant amounts of residential property may serve as collateral for such loans 
the company attempts to evaluate larger loans individually  on the basis of its loan review process  which scrutinizes loans on a selective basis  and other available information 
even if all commercial purpose loans could be reviewed  there is no assurance that information on potential problems would be available 
the company s portfolios of loans made for purposes of financing residential mortgages and consumer loans are evaluated in groups 
at december   loans made for commercial and construction  residential mortgage and consumer purposes  respectively  amounted to million  million and million

effects of inflation the majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
therefore  a financial institution differs greatly from most commercial and industrial companies that have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories 
management believes that the most significant impact of inflation on financial results is the company s need and ability to react to changes in interest rates 
as discussed previously  management attempts to maintain an essentially balanced position between rate sensitive assets and liabilities over a one year time horizon in order to protect net interest income from being affected by wide interest rate fluctuations
