as of april   our pay per view accounts receivable was million 
if our initial estimate is incorrect  it can result in significant adjustments to revenues in subsequent years 
television advertising revenues from the sale of television advertising are recorded when the commercial airs within our programming and are based upon contractual amounts previously established with our advertisers 
these contractual amounts are typically based on the advertisement reaching a desired number of viewers 
if an ad does not reach the desired number of viewers  we record an estimated reserve to reflect rebates or future free advertising due to advertisers  based on the difference between the intended delivery as contracted and actual delivery of audiences
