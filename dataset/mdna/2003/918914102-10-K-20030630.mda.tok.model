the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes  which are part of this report or incorporated by reference to our reports filed with the commission 
we undertake no obligation to publicly revise these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that arise after the date hereof 
business and business strategy we were founded in from through  our efforts were focused on developing and acquiring our battery technologies 
with the appointment of stephan b 
godevais as our chief executive officer and president in may  we initiated the transition of our business by broadening our marketing and sales efforts to take advantage of our strengths in research and development  which has fostered an extensive and worldwide portfolio of issued and pending patents 
with this strategic shift  our vision is to become a leader in energy storage systems by drawing on the numerous benefits of our latest battery technology  the extensive experience of our management team and the significant market opportunity available to us 
in february  we unveiled our saphion tm technology  a lithium ion technology which utilizes a phosphate based cathode material 
traditional lithium ion technology utilizes an oxide based cathode material  which has limited its adoption to small applications such as notebook computers  cellular phones and personal digital assistants pdas 
we believe that saphion tm technology addresses the major weaknesses of this existing technology while offering a solution that is competitive in cost and performance 
we believe that by incorporating a phosphate based cathode material  our saphion tm technology is able to offer greater thermal and electrochemical stability than traditional lithium ion technologies 
our business strategy incorporates a balance of system sales and licensing and a manufacturing plan that leverages internal capabilities and partnerships with contract manufacturers 
we plan to capitalize on our saphion tm technology by designing solutions that differentiate end users products in both the large format and small format markets 
in addition  we will seek to expand the fields of use of our saphion tm technology through the licensing of our intellectual property related to our battery chemistries and manufacturing processes 
we introduced our first product based on our saphion tm technology  the n charge tm power system  in february the n charge tm power system is a rechargeable battery system that provides supplemental battery power for a wide variety of portable electronic devices 
since the introduction of the n charge tm power system  we have focused our efforts on marketing the n charge tm power system to top tier companies in an effort to validate our saphion tm technology 
we have successfully developed various channels for the sale and distribution of the n charge tm system  including resellers  tier one companies  and national retailers 
in february  we introduced our first large format energy storage system powered by our saphion tm technology  the k charge tm power system previously announced as the pure power pack 
the k charge tm power system is engineered specifically for large format applications such as those required by the telecommunications  industrial  vehicular and utility markets 
it is currently in a prototype stage and is being offered to customers for evaluation and customization for specific product requirements 
currently  our battery products are offered in a polymer construction 
our research and development efforts are focused on a new generation of our saphion tm technology which  in addition to expected enhanced performance characteristics  will provide us the ability to manufacture batteries using the technology in a cylindrical construction  which we believe will greatly increase its potential in the marketplace 
our polymer batteries are manufactured at our manufacturing facility in northern ireland 
we have recently entered into an oem arrangement and have utilized the manufacturer s capabilities for certain cobalt oxide based products during the year 
we are in the process of qualifying the manufacturer for our saphion tm products with the goal of transferring some of our manufacturing operations to china and other low cost manufacturing regions 
basis of presentation  critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the us our accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts 
we believe our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to revenue recognition and impairment of long lived assets 
revenue recognition revenues are generated from licensing fees and royalties per technology license agreements and sales of products including batteries and battery systems 
licensing fees are recognized as revenue upon completion of an executed agreement and delivery of licensed information  if there are no significant remaining obligations and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
royalty revenues are recognized as revenue upon receipt of cash payment from the licensee 
product sales are recognized when the sale is complete  generally upon shipment  when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  seller s price to the buyer is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
impairment of long lived assets sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  requires us to review long lived tangible and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if long lived assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market value and is recorded in the period the determination was made 
results of operations fiscal years ended march  fiscal  march  fiscal and march  fiscal revenue 
the following table summarizes the company s revenue in thousands by type for each of the past three fiscal years march  percentage march  percentage march  change change battery and system sales    license and royalty revenue   total revenues    battery and system sales in december  we completed the acquisition of technology rights from telcordia technologies  inc and correspondingly completed a strategic shift away from expanding our battery sales pipeline to an emphasis on licensing and royalty revenue 
during fiscal  we implemented a balanced strategy leveraging revenues from both our licensing and battery lines of business 
as a result of the strategic shifts  our revenue for battery sales decreased to million in fiscal sales of battery and system products increased to million in fiscal largely due to the re establishment of our customer pipeline for our battery products and launch of our n charge tm power system product 
licensing and royalty revenue in december  we completed the acquisition of technology rights from telcordia technologies  inc we recorded initial revenues from licensing totaling million during fiscal during fiscal  we expanded our licensee base  including the conversion of the hanil joint venture to a license agreement  and began collecting royalties from our licensees resulting in a increase in license and royalty revenue 
during fiscal  we did not add any additional licensees and collected royalties totaling  we continue to pursue licensing of both our process and chemistry patent portfolios 
total revenues revenues from three significant customers totaled of total revenue for the fiscal year ended march  and of trade accounts receivable at march  during fiscal  revenue from two customers  alliant techsystems inc and pabion corporation  ltd  each comprised more than of total revenues 
for fiscal  revenues from six significant customers represented a total of of total revenues for the fiscal year and a total of of the trade accounts receivable at march  during fiscal  revenue from four customers  hanil joint venture  amperex technology limited  alliant techsystems inc  and samsung corporation  each comprised more than of total revenues 
for fiscal year  five customers represented of total revenues for the year ended march  for fiscal  revenue from four customers  alliant techsystems inc  microenergy technologies inc  moltech corporation  and qualcomm  each comprised more than of total revenues 
cost of sales 
cost of sales consists primarily of expenses incurred to manufacture battery products 
we initiated the recording of costs of sales as we ramped production and began our transition from a research and development focused organization during fiscal during fiscal and  we recorded cost of sales of million and million  respectively 
comparably  cost of sales totaled million during fiscal  net of grant funding of million provided by the northern ireland industrial development board  now known as invest northern ireland or ini  as a reduction of labor costs 
the increase in cost of sales from fiscal to is largely due to increased product sales  inventory write offs necessary as a result of the resolution of the technical issue announced in the second quarter of fiscal  and higher initial product costs associated with the launch of our n charge tm power system 
we maintained a negative gross margin on our sales in all periods due to insufficient production and sales volumes to facilitate the coverage of our indirect and fixed costs 
we expect cost of sales to decrease as a percentage of sales as production and product sales volumes continue to increase 
research and product development 
research and product development expenses consist primarily of personnel  equipment and materials to support the company s battery and product research and development 
research and product development expense totaled million  million  and million for the fiscal years ended march    and respectively 
the 
million or decrease in research and development expenses from fiscal to is due largely to the transfer of our initial saphion tm chemistry and n charge tm power system from development to production and the reduction of headcount as a result of our reorganization which took place in the third quarter of fiscal the million or increase in research and product development expenses from fiscal to relates to the both additional engineering for development of end user products such as the n charge tm power system and expanded development and pilot production of our saphion tm chemistry 
marketing 
marketing expenses consist primarily of costs related to sales and marketing personnel  public relations and promotional materials 
marketing expenses were million  million  and million for the fiscal years ended march    and  respectively 
the million or increase in marketing expenses during fiscal was due to increased staffing and promotions to support expansion of channels to sell our n charge tm power system and saphion tm products 
the million or increase in marketing expenses during fiscal resulted from increased personnel  the launch of a new corporate web site  the development of our on line store  and the creation of promotional materials and sales tools 
our increased expenditures in all periods are in line with our continued focus on sales and marketing activities through expansion of our sales teams  sales channels  and promotional activities 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for finance  human resources  accounting  information technology  legal  and corporate related expenses 
general and administrative expenses totaled million  million  and million for the fiscal years ended march    and respectively 
the million or decrease in general and administrative expenses from fiscal to relates to lower legal expenses and lower recruiting and relocation expenses with completion of relocation of the corporate office to austin  texas during fiscal the decrease is partially offset by an increase in insurance expense 
the million or increase in general and administrative expenses from fiscal to fiscal relate primarily to increased recruiting efforts associated with completion of the management team and relocation of the corporate office to austin  texas 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses were million  million  and million for fiscal years ended march    and  respectively 
the or decrease in fiscal and the million or decrease during fiscal resulted primarily from the impact of an impairment charge taken during the third quarter of fiscal as described below 
this decrease is partially offset by depreciation for capital assets acquired subsequent to the third quarter of fiscal impairment charge during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge of  on our property in henderson  nevada related to the planned sale of this facility 
we estimated that the future cash flows expected from the sale of this facility were less than the asset carrying value and adjusted the assets to their fair value accordingly 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded an impairment charge of million on assets in our northern ireland facility and intellectual property acquired from telcordia 
the fiscal impairment charge resulted from a redefinition of our business strategy and solidification of our manufacturing plan and product mix 
we determined that the future cash flows expected to be generated from older manufacturing equipment in our northern ireland facility and intellectual property acquired in the telcordia transaction in december did not exceed their carrying value 
this determination resulted in a net impairment charge against property  plant and equipment and intellectual property to adjust these assets to their fair value 
interest and other income 
interest and other income totaled  million  and million for fiscal years ended march    and  respectively 
interest during fiscal related primarily to interest earned on investments acquired from west coast venture capital in february these assets were transferred to berg berg as a reduction of our debt outstanding during the fourth quarter of fiscal interest expense 
interest expense was million  million and million for the fiscal years ended march    and  respectively 
the 
million or reduction in interest expense for fiscal was due to the payoff of the henderson facility mortgage and a reduction in the amortization of debt discount on the loan with berg berg enterprises  llc and partially offset by increased borrowings of long term debt 
the increase in interest expense for fiscal was the result of increased borrowings of long term debt 
equity in earnings loss of joint venture 
in june  we reached and agreement with our joint venture partner  hanil telecom co  ltd 
hanil telecom to terminate the hanil valence korean joint venture 
as conditions of the termination  shinhan bank transferred its payment guarantee obligations under a line of credit from us to hanil telecom and we granted a license to an affiliate of hanil telecom 
in addition  the deferred revenue balance of million was offset by approximately  of accounts receivable and the remaining million balance was recorded as license revenue to recognize the license agreement 
liquidity and capital resources at march   our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents of million and million available under an equity line financing commitment subject to conditions discussed below and a million working capital commitment with berg berg 
on june  we raised net proceeds of approximately million through the sale of one thousand shares of newly issued series c preferred stock to an unaffiliated investor 
in addition  in june we received an additional million funding commitment from berg berg for which the terms will be negotiated at a later date 
our current forecasts project that these sources of liquidity will be sufficient to allow us to execute on our current business plan without the need for additional financing 
our current business plan contemplates that we will realize increases in cash flow from the sale of our henderson  nevada facility  projected increases in product sales and licensing revenue and further cash benefits from continued reductions in our administrative and manufacturing costs  while maintaining capital expenditures and expenditures for research and development at levels consistent with those incurred in however  our cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned because of changes in our operations  including changes in oem relationships  market conditions  joint venture and business opportunities  or a request for repayment of a portion or all of our existing grants  which totaled million at march   from the northern ireland industrial development board now titled invest northern ireland or ini 
if we are unable to realize our business plan or if our cash requirements increase materially from those currently projected  we would require additional debt or equity financing 
there can be no assurance that we could obtain the additional financing on reasonable terms  if at all 
the series c preferred stock matures december  and carries a annual dividend  paid quarterly in cash or shares of common stock 
on the maturity date  we will redeem for cash any unconverted shares of the series c preferred stock at their stated value plus any accrued and unpaid dividends 
our current business plan contemplates conversion of all shares of series c preferred stock prior to their maturity date 
if the series c preferred stock shares have not been converted by the maturity date  we may need to raise additional debt or equity financing to facilitate any required redemption 
there can be no assurance that we could obtain the additional financing on reasonable terms  if at all 
currently  we do not have material sales to meet our operating needs 
consequently  we are dependent on berg berg s continued willingness to fund our continued operations 
however  pursuant to the terms of the equity line financing commitment  as a result of offerings the company completed in april and june  and the drawdowns under the commitment of million each in september  november  february  and march  berg berg may elect to reduce or eliminate its remaining commitment of million 
berg berg has not elected to reduce their commitment to date 
further  the commitment expires on march  and our right to draw down on the line is limited to million per quarter and is further dependent upon our meeting certain operating conditions 
however  so long as stephan godevais remains as ceo  berg berg has waived these operating conditions for the remainder of the commitment 
the additional million funding commitment obtained in june is subject to completion of definitive documentation and any required stockholder approval 
at march   we had commitments for capital expenditures for the next months of approximately  relating to the installation of specified manufacturing equipment  which is included in accounts payable and accrued expenses at march  we may require additional capital expenditures in order to meet greater demand levels for our products than are currently anticipated 
we used net cash from operations for fiscal  and of million  million  and million  respectively 
the cash used in our fiscal operating activities was primarily due to net loss and the add back of non cash expenses  including depreciation and amortization  provision for bad debt  impairment charge  accretion of debt discount  and compensation related to issuance of stock options 
the increase in operating cash outflows was substantially due to higher cost of sales  marketing expenses  and working capital needs associated with our increased battery sales and battery inventory 
we used  million  and million in investing activities in fiscal  and  respectively 
capital expenditures during all periods were primarily related to the establishment and expansion of our manufacturing facilities and equipment in our northern ireland facility 
the significant decrease in fiscal investing activities is due to the substantial completion of our northern ireland facility 
we obtained cash from financing activities of million  million  and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
as a result of the above  we had a net decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million and million in fiscal and  and a net increase in cash and cash equivalents of million in fiscal as of march   our short term and long term debt obligations  including long term interest  were  and million  respectively 
during fiscal  we reached an agreement with berg berg to extend the maturity date of our loan agreement with the loan balance of million and accrued interest of million from august  to september  during fiscal  through our dutch subsidiary  we signed an agreement or letter of offer with the northern ireland industrial development board now titled invest northern ireland ini  to open an automated manufacturing plant in northern ireland in exchange for capital and revenue grants from the ini 
the grants available under the agreement for an aggregate of up to pound million  generally became available over a five year period through october  as a condition to receiving funding from the ini  the subsidiary needed to maintain a minimum of pound million approximately million in debt or equity financing from us 
as of march   we had received grants aggregating pound million approximately million 
the amount of the grants available under the agreement depended primarily on the level of capital expenditures that we made 
any funding received under the grants in a four year period prior to any alleged default is repayable to the ini if the subsidiary is found to be in default under the agreement 
default includes the permanent cessation of business in northern ireland 
funding received under the grants to offset capital expenditures can be included in such repayable amount if related equipment is sold  transferred or otherwise disposed of during a four year period after the date of grant 
funding received under the grants can be included in such repayable amount if the subsidiary fails to maintain specified employment levels for the two year period immediately after the end of the five year grant period 
as a result of the reduction of northern ireland business activity  specified employment levels have not been maintained  but the ini is not seeking repayment and on the advice of counsel  on the basis that successful negotiations will be concluded  we do not believe that the ini will bring any legal action pursuant to the letter of offer 
we have begun discussions with the ini to end the current agreement and enter into a new agreement more closely aligned to current business conditions 
we may not be able to meet the requirements necessary to retain grants under the ini agreement 
we believe that it is unlikely that the ini will demand repayment of any grant funds paid in a four year period prior to any default on the part of the subsidiary 
inflation historically  our operations have not been materially affected by inflation 
however  our operations may be affected by inflation in the future

factors associated with the forward looking statements that could cause actual results to differ from those projected or forecasted in this report are included in the statements below 
in addition to other information contained in this report  you should carefully consider the following cautionary statements and risk factors 
risks related to our business execution of the business plan with the current available capital 
at march   our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents of million and million available under an equity line financing commitment subject to conditions discussed below and a million working capital commitment from berg berg 
on june  we raised net proceeds of approximately million through the sale of one thousand shares of newly issued series c preferred stock to an independent investor 
in addition  in june we received an additional million funding commitment from berg berg for which the terms will be negotiated at a later date 
our current forecasts project that these sources of liquidity will be sufficient to allow us to execute on our current business plan without the need for additional financing

further  the commitment expires on march  and our right to draw down on the line is limited to million per quarter and is further dependent upon meeting certain operating conditions 
however  so long as stephan godevais remains as ceo  berg berg has waived these conditions for the remainder of the commitment 
the additional million funding commitment obtained in june is subject to completion of definitive documentation and any required stockholder approval 
our working capital requirements may increase beyond those currently anticipated 
we have planned for an increase in sales  if we experience sales in excess of our plan  our working capital needs and capital expenditures would likely increase from that currently anticipated 
our ability to meet this additional customer demands would be dependent on our ability to arrange for additional equity or debt financing since it is likely that cash flow from sales is likely to lag behind these increased working capital requirements 
if our working capital needs increase from that currently anticipated and we do not receive additional financing from berg berg  we may need to arrange for additional equity or debt financing 
all of our assets are pledged as collateral under our loan agreements 
our failure to meet the obligations under our loan agreements could result in foreclosure of our assets 
all of our assets are pledged as collateral under various loan agreements 
if we fail to meet our obligations pursuant to these loan agreements  our lenders may declare all amounts borrowed from them to be due and payable together with accrued and unpaid interest 
if we are unable to repay our debt  these lenders could proceed against our assets 
we have a history of losses  have an accumulated deficit and may never achieve or sustain significant revenues or profitability 
we have incurred operating losses each year since inception in and had an accumulated deficit of million as of march  we have working capital of million as of march   and have sustained recurring losses related primarily to the research and development and marketing of our products combined with the lack of material sales 
we expect to continue to incur operating losses and negative cash flows during fiscal  as we begin to build inventory  increase our marketing efforts and continue our product development 
we may never achieve or sustain significant revenues or profitability in the future 
our business will be adversely affected if our saphion tm technology batteries are not commercially accepted 
we are researching and developing batteries based upon phosphate chemistry 
our batteries are designed and manufactured as components for other companies and end user customers 
our success is dependent on the acceptance of our batteries and the products using our batteries in their markets 
we may have technical issues that arise that may affect the acceptance of our products by our customers 
market acceptance may also depend on a variety of other factors  including educating the target market regarding the benefits of our products 
market acceptance and market share are also affected by the timing of market introduction of competitive products 
if we or our customers are unable to gain any significant market acceptance for saphion tm technology based batteries  our business will be adversely affected 
it is too early to determine if saphion tm technology based batteries will achieve significant market acceptance 
if we are unable to develop  manufacture and market products that gain wide customer acceptance  our business will be adversely affected 
the process of developing our products is complex and uncertain  and failure to anticipate customers changing needs and to develop products that receive widespread customer acceptance could significantly harm our results of operations 
we must make long term investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether our predictions will eventually result in products that the market will accept 
after a product is developed  we must be able to manufacture sufficient volumes quickly and at low costs 
to accomplish this  we must accurately forecast volumes  mix of products and configurations that meet customer requirements  and we may not succeed 
our patent applications may not result in issued patents 
patent applications in the united states are maintained in secrecy until the patents issue or are published 
since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature tends to lag behind actual discoveries by several months  we cannot be certain that we were the first creator of inventions covered by pending patent applications or the first to file patent applications on such inventions 
we also cannot be certain that our pending patent applications will result in issued patents or that any of our issued patents will afford protection against a competitor 
in addition  patent applications filed in foreign countries are subject to laws  rules and procedures which differ from those of the united states  and thus we cannot be certain that foreign patent applications related to issued united states patents will issue 
furthermore  if these patent applications issue  some foreign countries provide significantly less effective patent enforcement than the united states 
the status of patents involves complex legal and factual questions and the breadth of claims allowed is uncertain 
accordingly  we cannot be certain that patent applications we file will result in patents being issued  or that our patents and any patents that may be issued to us in the future will afford protection against competitors with similar technology 
in addition  patents issued to us may be infringed upon or designed around by others and others may obtain patents that we need to license or design around  either of which would increase costs and may adversely affect our operations 
if we cannot protect or enforce our existing intellectual property rights or if our pending patent applications do not result in issued patents  we may lose the advantages of our research and manufacturing systems 
our ability to compete successfully will depend on whether we can protect our existing proprietary technology and manufacturing processes 
we rely on a combination of patent and trade secret protection  non disclosure agreements and cross licensing agreements 
these measures may not be adequate to safeguard the proprietary technology underlying our batteries 
employees  consultants  and others who participate in the development of our products may breach their non disclosure agreements with us  and we may not have adequate remedies in the event of their breaches 
in addition  our competitors may be able to develop products that are equal or superior to our products without infringing on any of our intellectual property rights 
moreover  we may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights outside of the united states 
we have established a program for intellectual property documentation and protection in order to safeguard our technology base 
we intend to vigorously pursue enforcement and defense of our patents and our other proprietary rights 
we could incur significant expenses in preserving our proprietary rights  and these costs could harm our financial condition 
we also are attempting to expand our intellectual property rights through our applications for new patents 
we cannot be certain that our pending patent applications will result in issued patents or that our issued patents will afford us protection against a competitor 
our inability to protect our existing proprietary technologies or to develop new proprietary technologies may substantially impair our financial condition and results of operations 
intellectual property infringement claims brought against us could be time consuming and expensive to defend  and if any of our products or processes are found to be infringing  we may not be able to procure licenses to use patents necessary to our business at reasonable terms  if at all 
in recent years  there has been significant litigation in the united states involving patents and other intellectual property rights 
while we currently are not engaged in any intellectual property litigation or proceedings  we may become involved in these proceedings in the future 
in the future we may be subject to claims or inquiries regarding our alleged unauthorized use of a third party s intellectual property 
an adverse outcome in litigation could force us to do one or more of the following o stop selling  incorporating or using our products that use the challenged intellectual property  o pay significant damages to third parties  o obtain from the owners of the infringed intellectual property right a license to sell or use the relevant technology  which license may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all  or o redesign those products or manufacturing processes that use the infringed technology  which may be economically or technologically infeasible 
whether or not an intellectual property litigation claim is valid  the cost of responding to it  in terms of legal fees and expenses and the diversion of management resources  could be expensive and harm our business 
our failure to develop partnerships with other battery manufacturers will limit our ability to widely introduce our phosphate chemistry technology into the marketplace and could significantly impact our sales and profitability in future periods 
to successfully implement our business strategy of broadly disseminating the saphion tm technology  we intend to develop relationships with manufacturers of lithium ion batteries using stacked polymer technology as well as cylindrical and or prismatic battery manufacturers 
our failure to develop these relationships will limit our ability to widely introduce our phosphate chemistry technology into the marketplace and could significantly impact our sales and profitability in future periods 
in addition to our own product lines  our batteries are intended to be incorporated into other products 
we will need to rely on oems to commercialize these products 
our business strategy contemplates that we will be required to rely on assistance from oems to gain market acceptance for our products 
we therefore will need to identify acceptable oems and enter into agreements with them 
once we identify acceptable oems and enter into agreements with them  we will need to meet these companies requirements by developing and introducing new products and enhanced  or modified  versions of our existing products on a timely basis 
oems often require unique configurations or custom designs for batteries  which must be developed and integrated into their product well before the product is launched 
this development process not only requires substantial lead time between the commencement of design efforts for a customized battery system and the commencement of volume shipments of the battery system to the customer  but also requires the cooperation and assistance of the oems for purposes of determining the battery requirements for each specific application 
we may have technical issues that arise that may affect the acceptance of our products by oems 
if we are unable to design  develop and introduce products that meet oems requirements  we may lose opportunities to enter into additional purchase orders and our reputation may be damaged 
as a result  we may not receive adequate assistance from oems or battery pack assemblers to successfully commercialize our products  which could impair our profitability 
failure to implement an effective licensing business strategy will adversely affect our revenue  cash flow and profitability 
as a result of the intellectual property assets we have acquired and internally developed  such as our saphion tm technology  we significantly increased the role of licensing in our business strategy 
we have not entered into any licensing agreements for our saphion tm technology 
our future operating results could be affected by a variety of factors including o our ability to secure and maintain significant customers of our proprietary technology  o the extent to which our future licensees successfully incorporate our technology into their products  o the acceptance of new or enhanced versions of our technology  o the rate that our licensees manufacture and distribute their products to oems  and o our ability to secure one time license fees and ongoing royalties for our technology from licensees 
our future success will also depend on our ability to execute our licensing operations simultaneously with our other business activities 
if we fail to substantially expand our licensing activities while maintaining our other business activities  our results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected 
there is a potential sales channel conflict between our future technology licensees and us 
the acquisition of the telcordia technologies  inc s intellectual property assets and our saphion tm technology licensing strategy has added significant diversity to our overall business structure and our opportunities 
we recognize that there is potential for a conflict among our sales channels and those of our future technology licensees 
if these potential conflicts do materialize  we may not be able to mitigate the effect of a conflict that  if not resolved  may impact our results of operations 
our failure to cost effectively manufacture batteries in commercial quantities  which satisfy our customers product specifications  could damage our customer relationships and result in significant lost business opportunities for us 
to be successful  we must cost effectively manufacture commercial quantities of our batteries that meet customer specifications 
to facilitate commercialization of our products  we will need to reduce our manufacturing costs  which includes substantially raising and maintaining battery yields of commercial quality in a cost effective manner at our internal manufacturing site and reduce costs through the effective utilization of oem partners 
if we fail to substantially increase yields in our manufacturing process and reduce unit manufacturing costs  we will not be able to offer our batteries at a competitive price  and we will lose our current customers and fail to attract future customers 
our ability to manufacture large volumes of batteries is limited and may prevent us from fulfilling orders 
we have been manufacturing batteries on a commercial scale to fulfill purchase orders and we are able to produce sufficient quantities of batteries to supply our current customer demands 
we are actively soliciting additional purchase orders 
we may need additional low cost  quick lead time equipment or contract manufacturing support to fulfill large volume orders 
if we cannot rapidly increase our production capabilities to make sufficient quantities of commercially acceptable batteries  we may not be able to fulfill purchase orders in a timely manner  if at all 
in addition  we may not be able to procure additional purchase orders  which could cause us to lose existing and future customers  purchase orders  revenue and profits 
if our batteries fail to perform as expected  we could lose existing and future business  and our long term ability to market and sell our batteries could be harmed 
if we manufacture our batteries in commercial quantities and they fail to perform as expected  our reputation could be severely damaged  and we could lose existing or potential future business 
even if the performance failure is corrected  this performance failure might have the long term effect of harming our ability to market and sell our batteries 
we depend on a small number of customers for our revenues  and our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed if we were to lose the business of any one of them 
to date  our existing purchase orders in commercial quantities are from a limited number of customers 
during fiscal  revenue from two customers  alliant techsystems inc and pabion corporation  ltd  each comprised more than of total revenues 
during fiscal  revenue from four customers  hanil joint venture  amperex technology limited  alliant techsystems inc  and samsung corporation  each comprised more than of total revenues 
for fiscal  revenue from four customers alliant techsystems inc  microenergy technologies inc  moltech corporation  and qualcomm  each comprised more than of total revenues 
we anticipate that sales of our products to a limited number of key customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenues 
we do not have long term agreements with any of our customers and do not expect to enter into any long term agreements in the near future 
as a result  we face the substantial risk that one or more of the following events could occur o reduction  delay or cancellation of orders from a customer  o development by a customer of other sources of supply  o selection by a customer of devices manufactured by one of our competitors for inclusion in future product generations  o loss of a customer or a disruption in our sales and distribution channels  or o failure of a customer to make timely payment of our invoices 
if we were to lose one or more customers  or if we were to lose revenues due to a customer s inability or refusal to continue to purchase our batteries  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be harmed 
the fact that we depend on a sole source supplier or a limited number of suppliers for key raw materials might delay our production of batteries 
we depend on a sole source supplier or a limited number of suppliers for certain key raw materials used in manufacturing and developing our batteries 
we generally purchase raw materials pursuant to purchase orders placed from time to time and have no long term contracts or other guaranteed supply arrangements with our sole or limited source suppliers 
as a result  our suppliers may not be able to meet our requirements relative to specifications and volumes for key raw materials  and we may not be able to locate alternative sources of supply at an acceptable cost 
we have in the past experienced delays in product development due to the delivery of nonconforming raw materials from our suppliers  and if in the future we are unable to obtain high quality raw materials in sufficient quantities on competitive pricing terms and on a timely basis  it may delay battery production  impede our ability to fulfill existing or future purchase orders and harm our reputation and profitability 
we have four key executives 
the loss of a single executive or the failure to hire and integrate capable new executives could harm our business 
we do not have key man life insurance policies with respect to any of our key members of management 
without qualified executives  we face the risk that we will not be able to effectively run our business on a day to day basis or execute our long term business plan 
our oxide based batteries  which now comprise a small portion of our available products  contain potentially dangerous materials  which could expose us to product liability claims 
in the event of a short circuit or other physical damage to an oxide based battery  a reaction may result with excess heat or a gas being generated and released 
if the heat or gas is not properly released  the battery may be flammable or potentially explosive 
we could  therefore  be exposed to possible product liability litigation 
in addition  our batteries incorporate potentially dangerous materials  including lithium 
it is possible that these materials may require special handling or that safety problems may develop in the future 
we are aware that if the amounts of active materials in our batteries are not properly balanced and if the charge discharge system is not properly managed  a dangerous situation may result 
battery pack assemblers using batteries incorporating technology similar to ours include special safety circuitry within the battery to prevent such a dangerous condition 
we expect that our customers will have to use a similar type of circuitry in connection with their use of our oxide based products 
accidents at our facilities could delay production and adversely affect our operations 
an accident in our facilities could occur 
any accident  whether due to the production of our batteries or otherwise resulting from our facilities operations  could result in significant manufacturing delays or claims for damages resulting from personal or property injuries  which would adversely affect our operations and financial condition 
we depend upon the continued operation of our northern ireland facility 
operational problems at this facility could harm our business 
our revenues are dependent upon the continued operation of our manufacturing facility in northern ireland 
the operation of a manufacturing plant involves many risks  including potential damage from fire or natural disasters 
in addition  we have obtained permits to conduct our business as currently operated at the facility 
if the facility were destroyed and rebuilt  there is a possibility that these permits would not remain effective at the current location  and we may not be able to obtain similar permits to operate at another location 
the occurrence of these or any other operational problems at our northern ireland facility may harm our business 
we expect to sell a significant portion of our products to and derive a significant portion of our licensing revenues from customers located outside the united states 
foreign government regulations  currency fluctuations and increased costs associated with international sales could make our products and licenses unaffordable in foreign markets  which would reduce our future profitability 
we expect that international sales of our products and licenses  as well as licensing royalties  will represent an increasingly significant portion of our sales 
international business can be subject to many inherent risks that are difficult or impossible for us to predict or control  including o changes in foreign government regulations and technical standards  including additional regulation of rechargeable batteries or technology or the transport of lithium and phosphate  which may reduce or eliminate our ability to sell or license in certain markets  o foreign governments may impose tariffs  quotas and taxes on our batteries or our import of technology into their countries  o requirements or preferences of foreign nations for domestic products could reduce demand for our batteries and our technology  o fluctuations in currency exchange rates relative to the united states dollar could make our batteries and our technology unaffordable to foreign purchasers and licensees or more expensive compared to those of foreign manufacturers and licensors  o longer payment cycles typically associated with international sales and potential difficulties in collecting accounts receivable may reduce the future profitability of foreign sales and royalties  o import and export licensing requirements in northern ireland or other countries where we intend to conduct business may reduce or eliminate our ability to sell or license in certain markets  and o political and economic instability in northern ireland or other countries where we intend to conduct business may reduce the demand for our batteries and our technology or our ability to market our batteries and our technology in those countries 
these risks may increase our costs of doing business internationally and reduce our sales and royalties or future profitability 
we may need to expand our employee base and operations in order to effectively distribute our products commercially  which may strain our management and resources and could harm our business 
to implement our growth strategy successfully  we will have to increase our staff  primarily with personnel in sales  marketing  and product support capabilities  as well as third party and direct distribution channels 
however  we face the risk that we may not be able to attract new employees to sufficiently increase our staff or product support capabilities  or that we will not be successful in our sales and marketing efforts 
failure in any of these areas could impair our ability to execute our plans for growth and adversely affect our future profitability 
competition for personnel  in particular for product development and product implementation personnel  is intense  and we may have difficulty attracting the personnel necessary to effectively operate our business 
we believe that our future success will depend in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical  managerial and marketing personnel who are familiar with and experienced in the battery industry  as well as skilled personnel to operate our facility in northern ireland 
if we cannot attract and retain experienced sales and marketing executives  we may not achieve the visibility in the marketplace that we need to obtain purchase orders  which would have the result of lowering our sales and earnings 
we compete in the market for personnel against numerous companies  including larger  more established competitors with significantly greater financial resources than us 
we cannot be certain that we will be successful in attracting and retaining the skilled personnel necessary to operate our business effectively in the future 
political instability in northern ireland could interrupt manufacturing of our batteries and end user products at our northern ireland facility and cause us to lose sales and marketing opportunities 
northern ireland has experienced significant social and political unrest in the past and we cannot assure you that these instabilities will not continue in the future 
any political instability in northern ireland could temporarily or permanently interrupt our manufacturing of batteries and end user products at our facility in mallusk  northern ireland 
any delays could also cause us to lose sales and marketing opportunities  as potential customers would find other vendors to meet their needs 
risks associated with our industry if competing technologies that outperform our batteries were developed and successfully introduced  then our products might not be able to compete effectively in our targeted market segments 
rapid and ongoing changes in technology and product standards could quickly render our products less competitive  or even obsolete 
other companies are seeking to enhance traditional battery technologies  such as lead acid and nickel cadmium or have recently introduced or are developing batteries based on nickel metal hydride  liquid lithium ion and other emerging and potential technologies 
these competitors are engaged in significant development work on these various battery systems  and we believe that much of this effort is focused on achieving higher energy densities for low power applications such as portable electronics 
one or more new  higher energy rechargeable battery technologies could be introduced which could be directly competitive with  or superior to  our technology 
the capabilities of many of these competing technologies have improved over the past several years 
competing technologies that outperform our batteries could be developed and successfully introduced  and as a result  there is a risk that our products may not be able to compete effectively in our targeted market segments 
we have invested in research and development of next generation technology in energy solutions 
if we are not successful in developing and commercially exploiting new energy solutions based on new materials  or we experience delays in the development and exploitation of new energy solutions  compared to our competitors  our future growth and revenues will be adversely affected 
our principal competitors have greater financial and marketing resources than we do and they may therefore develop batteries similar or superior to ours or otherwise compete more successfully than we do 
competition in the rechargeable battery industry is intense 
the industry consists of major domestic and international companies  most of which have financial  technical  marketing  sales  manufacturing  distribution and other resources substantially greater than ours 
there is a risk that other companies may develop batteries similar or superior to ours 
in addition  many of these companies have name recognition  established positions in the market  and long standing relationships with oems and other customers 
we believe that our primary competitors are existing suppliers of liquid lithium ion  competing polymer and  in some cases  nickel metal hydride batteries 
these suppliers include sanyo  matsushita industrial co  ltd 
panasonic  sony  toshiba  saft and electrovaya 
most of these companies are very large and have substantial resources and market presence 
we expect that we will compete against manufacturers of other types of batteries in our targeted application segments  which include laptops  cellular telephones and personal digital assistant products  on the basis of performance  size and shape  cost and ease of recycling 
there is also a risk that we may not be able to compete successfully against manufacturers of other types of batteries in any of our targeted applications 
laws regulating the manufacture or transportation of batteries may be enacted which could result in a delay in the production of our batteries or the imposition of additional costs that would harm our ability to be profitable 
at the present time  international  federal  state or local law does not directly regulate the storage  use and disposal of the component parts of our batteries 
however  laws and regulations may be enacted in the future which could impose environmental  health and safety controls on the storage  use  and disposal of certain chemicals and metals used in the manufacture of lithium polymer batteries 
satisfying any future laws or regulations could require significant time and resources from our technical staff and possible redesign which may result in substantial expenditures and delays in the production of our product  all of which could harm our business and reduce our future profitability 
the transportation of lithium and lithium ion batteries is regulated both internationally and domestically 
under recently revised united nations recommendations and as adopted by the international air transport association iata  our n chargetm system currently falls within the level such that it is no longer exempt and now requires a class designation for transportation 
the revised united nations recommendations are not us law until such time as they are incorporated into the dot hazardous material regulations 
however  dot has proposed new regulations harmonizing with the un guidelines 
at present it is not known if or when the proposed regulations would be adopted by the us 
while we fall under the equivalency levels for the us and comply with all safety packaging requirements worldwide  future dot or iata regulations or enforcement policies could impose costly transportation requirements 
in addition  compliance with any new dot and iata approval process could require significant time and resources from our technical staff and if redesign were necessary  could delay the introduction of new products 
general risks associated with stock ownership corporate insiders or their affiliates will be able to exercise significant control over matters requiring stockholder approval that might not be in the best interests of our stockholders as a whole 
as of june   our officers  directors and their affiliates as a group beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
carl berg  one of our directors  beneficially owns approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  these stockholders will be able to exercise significant control over all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions  which could delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us 
the interest of our officers and directors  when acting in their capacity as stockholders  may lead them to o vote for the election of directors who agree with the incumbent officers or directors preferred corporate policy  or o oppose or support significant corporate transactions when these transactions further their interests as incumbent officers or directors  even if these interests diverge from their interests as stockholders per se and thus from the interests of other stockholders 
some provisions of our charter documents may make takeover attempts difficult  which could depress the price of our stock and limit the price potential acquirers may be willing to pay for our common stock 
our board of directors has the authority  without any action by the stockholders  to issue additional shares of our preferred stock  which shares may be given superior voting  liquidation  distribution and other rights as compared to those of our common stock 
the rights of the holders of our capital stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of additional shares of preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
these provisions may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control  may discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over its market price and may decrease the market price  and infringe upon the voting and other rights of the holders  of our common stock 
at any given time we might not meet the continued listing requirements of the nasdaq smallcap market 
given the volatility of our stock and trends in the stock market in general  at any given time we might not meet the continued listing requirements of the nasdaq smallcap market 
among other requirements  nasdaq requires the minimum bid price of a company s registered shares to be 
on june   the closing sale price of our common stock was 
if we are not able to maintain the requirements for continued listing on the nasdaq smallcap market  it could have a materially adverse effect on the price and liquidity of our common stock 
our stock price is volatile 
the market price of the shares of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile 
factors that may have a significant effect on the market price of our common stock include the following o fluctuation in our operating results  o announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products by us or our competitors  o failure to achieve operating results projected by securities analysts  o governmental regulation  o developments in our patent or other proprietary rights or our competitors developments  o our relationships with current or future collaborative partners  and o other factors and events beyond our control 
in addition  the stock market in general has experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
as a result of this potential stock price volatility  investors may be unable to sell their shares of our common stock at or above the cost of their purchase prices 
in addition  companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been the object of securities class action litigation 
if we were the subject of securities class action litigation  this could result in substantial costs  a diversion of our management s attention and resources and harm to our business and financial condition 
future sales of currently outstanding shares could adversely affect our stock price 
the market price of our common stock could drop as a result of sales of a large number of shares in the market or in response to the perception that these sales could occur 
in addition these sales might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate 
we had outstanding  shares of common stock as of march  in addition  at march   we had  shares of our common stock reserved for issuance under outstanding options and warrants  and  additional shares reserved for issuance under our stock option plans 
in connection with the potential conversion of the series c convertible preferred stock issued on june   we expect that we may need to issue up to  shares of our common stock based on a conversion price of and up to  shares in upon exercise of a related warrant issued on june  we do not intend to pay dividends on common stock and therefore stockholders will only be able to recover their investment in our common stock  if at all  by selling the shares of our stock that they hold 
some investors favor companies that pay dividends on common stock 
we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock 
we currently intend to retain any future earnings for funding growth and we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
because we may not pay dividends  a return on an investment in our stock likely depends on the ability to sell our stock at a profit
