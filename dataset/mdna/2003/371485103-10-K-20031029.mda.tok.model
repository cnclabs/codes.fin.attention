item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation general corporate history we were incorporated in delaware in september for the purpose of acquiring generex pharmaceuticals  inc  a canadian corporation formed in november to engage in pharmaceutical and biotechnological research and other activities 
our acquisition of generex pharmaceuticals was completed in october in a transaction in which the holders of all outstanding shares of generex pharmaceuticals exchanged their shares for shares of our common stock 
in january  we participated in a reverse acquisition with green mt 
ps  inc  a previously inactive idaho corporation formed in as a result of this transaction  our shareholders the former shareholders of generex pharmaceuticals acquired a majority approximately of the outstanding capital stock of green mt  we became a wholly owned subsidiary of green mt  green mt 
changed its corporate name to generex biotechnology corporation generex idaho  and we changed our corporate name to gbc delaware  inc because the reverse acquisition resulted in our shareholders becoming the majority holders of generex idaho  we were treated as the acquiring corporation in the transaction for accounting purposes 
thus  our historical financial statements  which essentially represented the historical financial statements of generex pharmaceuticals  were deemed to be the historical financial statements of generex idaho 
in april  we completed a reorganization in which we merged with generex idaho 
in this transaction  all outstanding shares of generex idaho were converted into our shares  generex idaho ceased to exist as a separate entity  and we changed our corporate name back to generex biotechnology corporation 
this reorganization did not result in any material change in our historical financial statements or current financial reporting 
in august  we acquired antigen express  inc antigen is engaged in the research and development of technologies and immunomedicines for the treatment of malignant  infectious  autoimmune and allergic diseases 
for details about the this acquisitions  see developments subsequent to fiscal below 
business history we are engaged in the development of proprietary drug delivery technology 
our principal business focus has been to develop a technology for buccal delivery absorption through the inner cheek walls of large molecule drugs  ie  drugs composed of molecules with molecular weights above a specified level 
large molecule drugs historically have been administered only by injection because their size inhibits or precludes absorption if administered by oral  transdermal  transnasal or other means 
our first product is an insulin formulation that is administered as a fine spray into the oral cavity using a hand held aerosol spray applicator 
between january and september  we conducted limited clinical trials on this product in the united states  canada  europe and ecuador 
in september  we entered into an agreement to develop this product with eli lilly and company lilly 
to date  over patients with diabetes have been dosed with our oral insulin product at approved facilities in seven countries 
we have conducted several clinical trials with insulin supplied by lilly under our agreement 
lilly did not  however  authorize or conduct any clinical trials or provide financial support for those trials 
we did receive a  up front payment from lilly 
on may   we announced that we had agreed with lilly to end the development and license agreement for the development and commercialization of buccal delivery of insulin 
we are currently negotiating terms for lilly to continue to supply a specified amount of insulin for further development of our product 
we will retain all of the intellectual property and commercialization rights with respect to the buccal spray drug delivery technology  and we will have the continuing right to develop and commercialize the product 
in january  we established a joint venture with elan international services  ltd 
eis  a wholly owed subsidiary of elan corporation  plc eis and elan corporation  plc being collectively referred to as elan 
the joint venture will pursue the application of certain of our and elan s drug delivery technologies  including our platform technology for the buccal delivery of pharmaceutical products  for the treatment of prostate cancer  endometriosis and or the suppression of testosterone and estrogen 
in january  the parties expanded the joint venture to include buccal morphine for the management of pain and selected buccal morphine as the initial product for development under generex bermuda ltd 
this expansion of the joint venture occurred after we successfully completed a proof of concept clinical study of morphine delivery using our proprietary buccal delivery technology 
in connection with the joint venture  eis purchased  shares of a new series of our preferred stock  designated as series a preferred stock  for  we applied the proceeds from the sale of the series a preferred stock to subscribe for an equity ownership interest in generex bermuda  ltd 
eis paid in capital of  to subscribe for a equity interest in generex bermuda  ltd 
while we initially own of the joint venture entity  eis has the right  subject to certain conditions  to increase its ownership up to by exchanging the series a preferred stock for of our interest in the joint venture entity 
in january and  pursuant to the terms of the agreement with eis  eis received a stock dividend of series a preferred stock 
generex bermuda  ltd 
was granted non exclusive licenses to utilize our buccal delivery technology and certain elan drug delivery technologies 
using the funds from its initial capitalization  generex bermuda  ltd 
paid a non refundable license fee of  to elan in consideration for being granted the rights to utilize the elan drug delivery technologies 
eis also purchased  shares of our common stock for  we may use the proceeds of this sale for any corporate purpose 
if the joint venture achieves certain milestones  we may require eis to purchase an additional  of our common stock at a premium to the then prevailing fair market value of our common stock 
our new subsidiary antigen is engaged in research and development of technologies and immunomedicines for the treatment of malignant  infectious  autoimmune and allergic diseases 
our immunomedicine products work by stimulating the immune system to either attack offending agents ie  cancer cells  bacteria  and viruses or to stop attacking benign elements ie  self proteins and allergens 
our immunomedicine products are based on two platform technologies that were discovered by an executive officer of antigen  the ii key hybrid peptides and ii suppression 
our immunomedicine products are in the pre clinical stage of development and trials in human patients are not expected for months 
development efforts are underway in melanoma  breast cancer  prostate cancer  hiv and type i diabetes 
we are establishing collaborations with academic centers to advance the technology  with the ultimate goal of conducting clinical testing 
we do not expect to receive any revenues from product sales in the current fiscal year 
we expect  however  to satisfy all of our cash needs during the current year from capital raised through prior equity financing 
disclosure regarding research and development projects our major research and development projects are the refinement of our basic buccal delivery technology  our buccal insulin project and our buccal morphine product 
both our insulin product and our morphine product are in clinical trials 
in canada  we have recently begun phase ii b trials for insulin 
in order to obtain fda and canadian hpb approval for any of our product candidates  we will be required to complete phase iii trials which involve testing our product with a large number of patients over a significant period of time 
the conduct of phase iii trials will require significantly greater funds than we either have on hand or have in experience in raising in any year or two years time 
we will therefore need to receive funding from a corporate collaborator  or engage in fundraising on a scale with which we have no experience 
because of various uncertainties  we cannot predict the timing of completion of our buccal insulin or buccal morphine products 
these uncertainties include the success of current studies  our ability to obtain the required financing and the time required to obtain regulatory approval even if our research and development efforts are completed and successful 
for the same reasons  we cannot predict when any products may begin to produce net cash inflows 
most of our research and development activities to date have involved developing our platform technology for use with insulin and morphine 
insubstantial amounts have been expended on projects with other drugs  and those projects involved a substantial amount of platform technology development 
therefore  in the past  we have not made significant distinctions in the accounting for research and development expenses among products  as a significant potion of all research has involved improvements to the platform technology in connection with insulin  which may benefit all our potential products 
in the fiscal year ended july   approximately of our  in research expenses was attributable to insulin and platform technology development  and approximately was attributable to morphine and fentanyl projects 
as morphine and fentanyl are both narcotic painkillers  the research is related 
in the fiscal year ended july   approximately of our  of research and development was expended for insulin and platform technology  and approximately for morphine and fentanyl 
developments in fiscal in august  we purchased approximately million of property for investment purposes  which is included at book value in assets held for investment  net 
the property is situated in the same location as our pilot plant 
in conjunction with the purchase  we incurred approximately million of additional long term debt based upon exchange rates in effect during the period 
the debt is held by a canadian chartered bank the bank and the seller 
as of july   approximately  is due to the bank and is to be repaid in monthly principal installments of approximately  plus interest  with final payment of the remaining principal balance due on the th month 
the loan bears interest at a fixed rate of per annum  and is secured by the property acquired  assignment of rental income of the property  funds on deposit of approximately  and a general guarantee by us 
the guarantee is limited to million canadian dollars approximately  and is extended for as long as a balance is outstanding on the original loan 
as of july   approximately  is due to the seller with monthly interest payments at per annum for months with the principal due on july  and which is subordinated to the amount due to the bank 
we intend to hold this property for investment purposes and collect rental income 
included in income from rental operations  net is  of rental income and  of rental expenses  including interest charges of  for the fiscal year ended july developments subsequent to fiscal in august  we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of antigen pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger the merger agreement between us  antigen and agexp acquisition  inc agexp  our wholly owned subsidiary that was formed for purposes of the transaction 
pursuant to the merger agreement o agexp merged with and into antigen the merger  o antigen became our wholly owned subsidiary  and o all of the former shareholders antigen are entitled to receive shares of our common stock in exchange for their shares of antigen capital stock 
antigen has facilities and its headquarters located at worcester  massachusetts 
antigen is engaged in research and development to develop immunomedicines for the treatment of malignant  infectious  autoimmune and allergic diseases 
antigen s potential products are based on two platform technologies ii key hybrid peptides and ii suppression discovered by an officer of antigen 
the merger agreement provides that each holder of antigen common stock and each holder of each of the four outstanding series of antigen preferred stock will receive shares of our common stock for each share of antigen common stock or preferred stock held by such holder 
the merger agreement establishes exchange rates for the conversion of antigen common and the various series of preferred stock into our common stock 
assuming that no antigen stockholder exercises appraisal rights  an aggregate of approximately  shares of our common stock will be issued to the former antigen stockholders in connection with the merger 
in addition  pursuant to the merger agreement  we assumed antigen common stock purchase options 
if these options are fully exercised  the option holders will receive  shares of our common stock 
the shares of our common stock issued in connection with the merger will be restricted securities 
however  we have undertaken to register the shares for resale 
we have committed to funding at least  for antigen s research and development projects in the next two years 
restatement subsequent to the issuance of its financial statements for the year ended july   management determined that its series a preferred stock should be reclassified from stockholders equity  in accordance with emerging issues task force topic d  classification and measurement of redeemable securities  because the redemption feature of the series a preferred stock is beyond our control 
this restatement did not affect net loss for the year ended july   nor did it affect total assets 
the series a preferred stock should have been included outside the statement of stockholders equity from the date of its issuance in january results of operations compared with we had a net loss of  for the year ended july  fiscal compared to a loss of  in the year ended july  fiscal 
the net loss for fiscal and excludes  and  respectively in preferred stock dividend on preferred shares 
the decrease in our fiscal net loss resulted from a decrease in research and development expenses to  from  that was offset in part by an increase in general and administrative expenses to  from  the increase in general and administrative expenses for fiscal reflects the issuance of common stock  options and warrants to employees  consultants and advisors for services rendered that resulted in an increase in non cash charges of  to  from 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was partially offset by a decrease in legal and litigation expenses and a reduction in travel expenses 
the decrease in research and development expenses for fiscal reflects the decreased level of research and development activities under our collaboration with elan and under the collaboration with lilly  which terminated in may our interest and miscellaneous income net of interest expense in fiscal decreased to  from  in fiscal due to decreases in our cash and short term investments and lower interest rates 
we received income from rental operations net of expense of  in fiscal we did not receive any revenues in fiscal in both of the last two fiscal years  we incurred substantial expenses for financial advisory and other financing services that were not related to a specific financing and  therefore  were accounted for as general and administrative expenses 
these expenses  in fiscal and  in fiscal were paid partially through the issuance of common stock and or warrants and options to purchase common stock 
in addition  in fiscal  the minority shareholder s share of the loss generated by generex bermuda  ltd  was as compared to a  in fiscal results of operations compared with we had a net loss of  for the year ended july  fiscal compared to a loss of  in the year ended july  fiscal 
the net loss for fiscal excludes  in preferred stock dividend on preferred shares 
no preferred stock dividend was payable in fiscal the decrease in our fiscal net loss resulted from decreases in research and development expenses to  from  and general and administrative expenses to  from 
the decrease in our expenses was partially offset by a decrease in interest and other income 
our interest and miscellaneous income net of interest expense in fiscal decreased to  from  in fiscal due to decreases in our cash and short term investments 
we did not receive any revenues in fiscal in fiscal  we received  in revenue from our agreement with lilly 
the principal reasons for the decrease in our research and development expense from fiscal to resulted from the accounting treatment for our joint venture with elan  which resulted in a  research and development expense for the license fee paid by generex bermuda ltd 
to elan for technology rights in our consolidated net loss  which includes this expense  however  was partially offset by approximately million of minority interest  reflecting elan s ownership interest in the joint venture 
our general and administrative expenses decreased due to reductions in various categories of these expenses  including a reduction of approximately  in financial services expenses principally due to a decrease in the number and value of compensatory warrants and options issued and a reduction of approximately  in the amount of consulting fees paid 
our expense reductions were partially offset by an increase in executive compensation of approximately  and small increases in other expense categories 
in both fiscal and  we incurred substantial expenses for financial advisory and other financing services that were not related to a specific financing and  therefore  were accounted for as general and administrative expenses 
these expenses  in fiscal and  in fiscal were paid partially through the issuance of shares of common stock and or warrants and options to purchase common stock 
in addition  in fiscal  the minority shareholder s share of the loss generated by generex bermuda  ltd  was  as compared to a  minority interest share of loss in fiscal critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
it requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we consider certain accounting policies related to impairment of long lived assets  intangible assets and accrued liabilities to be critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations impairment of long lived assets 
we review for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of property and equipment may not be recoverable under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
if it is determined that an impairment loss has occurred based upon expected future cash flows  the loss is recognized in the statement of operations 
intangible assets 
we have intangible assets related to patents 
the determination of the related estimated useful lives and whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgments 
in assessing the recoverability of these intangible assets  we use an estimate of undiscounted operating income and related cash flows over the remaining useful life  market conditions and other factors to determine the recoverability of the asset 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges against these assets 
estimating accrued liabilities  specifically litigation accruals 
our current estimated range of liabilities related to pending litigation is based on management s best estimate of future costs 
while the final resolution of the litigation could result in amounts different than current accruals  and therefore have an impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period  we believe the ultimate outcome will not have a significant effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
liquidity and capital resources to date we have financed our development stage activities primarily through private placements of common stock 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we raised an aggregate of approximately million from private placements and from exercise of outstanding warrants 
in fiscal we granted stock options  warrants and shares of common stock to employees  consultants and advisors with a value of  for services rendered  all of which are included in general and administrative expenses 
in september  we began a program to repurchase up to million of our common stock from the open market 
through july   we repurchased a total of  shares of common stock to be held in treasury for  at an average price of per share 
notwithstanding the repurchase of additional  shares of common stock  our net loss resulted in a decrease in stockholders equity to  at july   versus  at july  at july   we had on hand cash and short term investments primarily notes of us corporations of approximately million versus approximately million at july  we believe that our current cash position is sufficient to meet all of our working capital needs for at least the next months 
beyond that  we may require additional funds to support our working capital requirements or for other purposes and may seek to raise funds through private or public equity financing or from other sources 
if we were unable to raise additional capital as needed  we could be required to scale back or otherwise revise our business plan 
any significant scale back of operations or modification of our business plan due to a lack of funding could be expected to materially and adversely affect our prospects 
in the past we have funded most of our development and other costs with equity financing 
while we have been able to raise equity capital as required  unforeseen problems with our clinical program or materially negative developments in general economic conditions could interfere with our ability to raise additional equity capital as needed  or materially adversely affect the terms upon which such capital is available 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
transactions with affiliates on may   we advanced  to each of three senior officers  who are also our shareholders  in exchange for promissory notes 
these notes bore interest at percent per annum and were payable in full on may  these notes were guaranteed by a related company owned by these officers and secured by a pledge of  shares of our common stock owned by this related company 
on june   our board of directors extended the maturity date of the loans to october  the other terms and conditions of the loans and guaranty remained unchanged and in full force and effect 
as of july   the balance outstanding on these notes  including accrued interest  was  pursuant to a decision made by the compensation committee as of august   these loans were satisfied through the application of  shares of pledged stock  at a value of per share  which represented the lowest closing price during the sixty days prior to august  prior to january   a portion of our general and administrative expenses resulted from transactions with affiliated persons  and a number of capital transactions also involved affiliated persons 
although these transactions were not the result of arms length negotiations  we do not believe that this fact had a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
prior to december   we classified certain payments to executive officers for compensation and expense reimbursements as research and development related party and general and administrative related party because the executive officers received such payments through personal services corporations rather than directly 
after december   these payments have been and will continue to be accounted for as though the payments were made directly to the officers  and not as a related party transaction 
we do not foresee a need for  and therefore do not anticipate  any related party transactions in the current fiscal year 
on august   we purchased real estate with an aggregate purchase price of approximately million from an unaffiliated party 
in connection with that transaction  angara enterprises  inc  a licensed real estate broker that is an affiliate of anna gluskin  received a commission from the proceeds of the sale to the seller in the amount of of the purchase price  or  we believe that this is less than the aggregate commission which would have been payable if a commission had been negotiated with an unaffiliated broker on an arm s length basis 
we utilize a management company to manage all of our real properties 
the property management company is owned by rose perri  anna gluskin and the estate of mark perri  our former chairman of the board 
for the fiscal years ended july   and  we have paid the management company   and  respectively  in management fees

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks associated with changes in the exchange rates between us and canadian currencies and with changes in the interest rates related to our fixed rate debt 
we do not believe that any of these risks will have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
at the present time  we maintain our cash in short term government or government guaranteed instruments  short term commercial paper  interest bearing bank deposits or demand bank deposits which do not earn interest 
a substantial majority of these instruments and deposits are denominated in us dollars  with the exception of funds denominated in canadian dollars on deposit in canadian banks to meet short term operating needs in canada 
at the present time  with the exception of professional fees and costs associated with the conduct of clinical trials in the united states and europe  substantially all of our operating expense obligations are denominated in canadian dollars 
we do not presently employ any hedging or similar strategy intended to mitigate against losses that could be incurred as a result of fluctuations in the exchange rates between us and canadian currencies 
as of july   we have fixed rate debt totaling  of which   and  bears interest at a fixed rate of  and  respectively 
these debt instruments mature from july through october as our fixed rate debt mature  we will likely refinance such debt at their existing market interest rates which may be more or less than interest rates on the maturing debt 
since this debt is fixed rate debt  if interest rates were to increase basis points prior to maturity  there would be no impact on earnings or cash flows 
we have neither issued nor own any long term debt instruments  or any other financial instruments  for trading purposes and as to which we would be subject to material market risks
