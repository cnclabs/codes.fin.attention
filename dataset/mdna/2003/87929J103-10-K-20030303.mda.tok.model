telecommunication systems  inc  et al  united states district court for the southern district of new york  civil action no 
cv the plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount of damages 
the lawsuit purports to be a class action suit filed on behalf of purchasers of our common stock during the period august  through december  the plaintiffs allege that the underwriters agreed to allocate common stock offered for sale in our initial public offering to certain purchasers in exchange for excessive and undisclosed commissions and agreements by those purchasers to make additional purchases of common stock in the aftermarket at pre determined prices 
the plaintiffs allege that all of the defendants violated sections  and of the securities act of  as amended  and that the underwriters violated section b of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and rule b promulgated thereunder 
the claims against us of violation of rule b have been dismissed with the plaintiffs having the right to re plead 
we intend to vigorously defend the lawsuit 
we believe that more than other companies have been named in nearly identical lawsuits that have been filed by some of the same law firms that represent the plaintiffs in the lawsuit against us

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to intangible assets and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we identified our most critical accounting policies to be those related to revenue recognition for our software contracts with multiple elements  contracts accounted for using the percentage of completion method  capitalized software  intangible assets and evaluation of impairment 
we describe these accounting policies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements and at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview we manage our business in three segments network software  service bureau and network solutions 
our network software segment consists of the development and licensing of software products and of related services 
our service bureau segment includes our e and hosted software application offerings 
our network solutions segment includes the design  development and deployment of information processing and communication systems and related services 
the following table sets forth information regarding each of our segments year ended december  revenue network software network software licenses network software services network software total service bureau network solutions total revenue segment gross profit network software service bureau network solutions total segment gross profit gross profit is defined as revenue less direct cost of revenue  excluding the amortization of software development costs  which under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  is considered in 
table of contents determining gross profit from software license revenues 
a reconciliation of segment gross profit to loss before income taxes and extraordinary item is as follows year ended december  total segment gross profit research and development expense sales and marketing expense general and administrative expense non cash stock compensation expense depreciation and amortization of property and equipment amortization of software development costs amortization of goodwill and other intangibles acquired in process research and development impairment of goodwill and other intangibles interest expense other income loss before income taxes and extraordinary item for the year ended december   customers that accounted for or more of total revenue were hutchison g  verizon wireless and various us government agencies 
the loss of any of these customers would have a material adverse impact on our business 
for the year ended december  and  customers that accounted for or more of total revenue were lucent technologies and various us government agencies 
total company backlog at january  was million 
the backlog at any given time may be affected by a number of factors  including contracts being renewed or new contracts being signed before existing contracts are completed 
accordingly  a comparison of backlog from period to period is not necessarily meaningful and may not be indicative of eventual actual shipments or future revenue 
network software revenue and related direct cost 
we market our network software products and services by responding to requests for proposals  through our direct sales force and through channel partners 
we generate network software revenue from licensing of our software products  and providing related maintenance and deployment services 
we also sell custom software applications 
the wireless internet gateway  tcs xypoint location platform products  short message service center smsc  as well as prepaid wireless and alerting and message notification applications are the principal generators of software license fees 
we sell all of our software products directly to carriers 
initial licensing fees are a function of the number of subscribers in the network where our software is deployed 
as a carrier s subscriber base increases  the carrier must purchase additional capacity under its license agreement and we receive additional revenue 
generally  we recognize license fee revenue when each of the following has occurred evidence of an arrangement is in place  we have delivered software  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the fee is probable 
software projects that require significant customization are accounted for under the percentage of completion method 
we measure progress to completion using costs incurred compared to estimated total costs 
software license fees billed and not recognized as revenue are included in deferred revenue 
we have also historically sold some of our network software products through our channel relationship with lucent 
this sales process typically includes participation of our engineers along with lucent in presenting our products to prospective customers 
lucent pays us initial license fees generally equal to of the revenue it generates from sales of the short message service center application that we developed under our development agreement 
for sales of our wireless internet gateway  lucent pays us initial fees ranging between and of the sale value which we negotiate on a case by case basis 
our network software service revenue arises from annual maintenance fees for our packaged and custom software products and fees from custom development and implementation of software products 
maintenance 
table of contents fees on packaged software are collected in advance and recognized ratably over the maintenance period 
unrecognized maintenance fees are included in deferred revenue 
custom software development  implementation and maintenance services may be provided under time and materials or fixed fee contracts 
we also occasionally sell computer equipment as part of our packaged software sales 
we recognize fixed fee contract revenue using the percentage of completion method 
we measure progress to completion using costs incurred compared to estimated total costs 
we recognize estimated losses under long term contracts in their entirety upon discovery 
if we did not accurately estimate total costs to complete a contract or do not manage our contracts within the planned budget  then future margins may be negatively affected or losses on existing contracts may need to be recognized 
the direct cost of our network software revenue consists primarily of compensation  benefits  purchased equipment  third party software and travel expenses incurred when providing our services 
service bureau revenue and direct cost of revenue 
our service bureau offerings include our e application  hosted position determining entity pde software and message distribution center applications 
revenue from our service bureau offerings consists of monthly recurring service fees and is recognized in the month earned 
e and pde service fees are primarily dependent on the number of subscribers the carrier covers  public service answering points psaps served or cell sites that provide e services for the carrier 
as the carrier s number of subscribers  psaps  or cell sites increases  the monthly recurring service fees increase 
message distribution center revenue is priced based on message volume 
the direct cost of our service bureau revenue consists primarily of compensation  benefits  purchased equipment  third party software and travel expenses incurred when providing our services  as well as the cost of our network operations centers circuits for connectivity to carrier customers and local governments public safety answering points 
network solutions revenue and related direct cost 
we generate network solutions revenue from the design  development and deployment of information processing and communication systems for corporate and government enterprises 
representative examples of recent network solutions projects include delivery of our swiftlink product  lightweight  secure  deployable communications systems to the us departments of state and defense 
swiftlink provides secure voice  video and data communications  supports a worldwide network during trips abroad and throughout the united states and provides full network functionality and ip telephony capability using landlines and satellite based technologies 
during the first quarter of  we began operation of our teleport facility in baltimore  md  which supports the integration of satellite communications and terrestrial wireless broadband with us broadband networks 
through this teleport facility we now offer voice  video and data connectivity via satellite to north and south america  as well as africa and europe 
we generally provide network solutions under long term contracts 
we recognize revenue under long term contracts as billable costs are incurred and for fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method  measured by total costs incurred compared to total estimated costs 
we recognize estimated losses on contracts in their entirety upon discovery 
if we did not accurately estimate total costs to complete a contract or do not manage our contracts within the planned budget  then future margins may be negatively affected or losses on existing contracts may need to be recognized 
under our contracts with the us government  contract costs  including the allocated indirect expenses  are subject to audit and adjustment by the defense contract audit agency 
we record revenue under these contracts at estimated net realizable amounts 
the direct cost of our network solutions revenue consists primarily of compensation  benefits  travel  purchased equipment and the costs of third party contractors that we engage 
our direct costs of providing services under long term contracts include an allocation of indirect costs at rates that comply with federal contractor cost accounting regulations 
research and development expense 
our research and development expense consists of the costs of developing software products incurred prior to establishing technological feasibility 
for new products  technological feasibility is established when an operative version of the computer software product is completed in the same software language as the product to be ultimately marketed  performs all the major functions planned for the product  and has successfully completed initial customer testing 
technological feasibility for enhancements to an existing product is established when a detail program design is completed 
we incur research and development costs to enhance existing packaged software products as well as to create 
table of contents new software products 
these costs primarily include compensation and benefits as well as costs associated with using third party laboratory and testing resources 
we expense research and development costs as they are incurred 
sales and marketing expense 
our sales and marketing expenses include compensation and benefits  trade show  travel  advertising and public relations costs which are expensed as incurred 
our marketing efforts also include speaking engagements and attending and sponsoring industry conferences 
we sell our network software products and services through our direct sales force and through indirect channels 
we have also historically leveraged our relationship with lucent to market our network software products to wireless carrier customers and we added motorola as a sales channel in we sell our network solutions primarily through direct sales professionals 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation costs and other costs associated with management  finance  human resources and internal information systems 
these costs include compensation and benefits  rent  utilities and other facilities costs which are expensed as incurred 
non cash stock compensation expense 
during the second and third quarters of  we granted options to purchase  shares of class a common stock to employees and directors at an exercise price less than the fair market value of our class a common stock at the date of grant 
we will record future additional stock compensation expense of approximately million as a result of these option grants that will be recognized ratably over the remaining vesting period of three years 
during the years ended december   and  we recognized approximately million  million and million  respectively  of stock compensation expense related to these grants 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense other than amortization of software development costs represents the period costs associated with our investment in computers  telephony equipment  software  furniture and fixtures  and leasehold improvements 
we compute depreciation and amortization using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
amortization of software development costs 
we capitalize software development costs after we establish technological feasibility  and amortize those costs over the estimated useful lives of the software beginning on the date when the software is first available for general release 
we calculate amortization of software development costs on a product by product basis using the straight line method over the remaining estimated economic life of the product  which is never greater than three years 
we also compute amortization using the ratio that current revenue for the product bears to the total of current and anticipated future revenue for that product 
if this revenue curve method results in amortization greater than the amount computed using the straight line method  we record amortization at that greater amount 
amortization as a percentage of software license fees is generally a higher percentage in the early stages of a product s life cycle 
our policies to determine when to capitalize software development costs and how much to amortize in a given period requires us to make subjective estimates and judgments 
if our software products do not achieve the level of market acceptance that we expect and our future revenue estimates for these products change  the amount of amortization that we record may increase compared to prior periods 
amortization of other intangible asset 
other intangible asset consists of the xypoint tradename 
the cost of the tradename is being amortized over its estimated useful life of three years using the straight line method 
other income 
other income consists primarily of income earned on cash equivalents  foreign currency transaction gain or loss and other income related to recording our derivative investment activities 
year ended december  vs 
year ended december  revenue 
total revenue increased million  or  to million in from million in total network software revenue increased million  or  to million in from million in network software license revenue increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase is primarily due to revenue recognized from a large multi carrier network 
table of contents location platform project 
network software service revenue decreased million  or  to million in from million in this decrease is primarily due to the completion of work on two significant custom software contracts in service bureau revenue increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase in revenue is due to an increase in the number of customers and related e deployments 
as of december  we were serving over  public service answering point psap connections  almost double the connections served as of december  network solutions revenue increased million  or  to million in from million in revenue increased in primarily due to increased volume of deployable communication system sales and several new federal government customer projects completed during the year 
direct cost of revenue 
total direct cost of revenue increased million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  direct cost of revenue increased to in from in direct cost of network software increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase in direct cost of network software is primarily a result of an increase in labor and other direct costs related to a large location platform project and hardware costs associated with our license sales 
as a percentage of related revenue  direct cost of network software increased to in from in this increase is primarily a result of the mix of projects in including more hardware and customization than in direct cost of service bureau increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase in costs is related to deploying approximately  psaps during as a percentage of related revenue  direct cost of service bureau increased from in to in the increase in direct cost of service bureau as a percentage of revenue is due to lower average per unit pricing under new long term contracts 
direct cost of network solutions increased million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of related revenue  direct cost of network solutions was approximately for both and network solutions projects have variable margins that fluctuate based on the type and complexity of the projects 
any variances in margins between periods are primarily due to changes in the mix of projects 
research and development expense 
research and development expense decreased million  or  to million in from million for the decrease is due to the timing and mix of projects in development 
management continually assesses our spending on research and development to ensure resources are focused on products that are expected to achieve the highest level of success 
in  projects under development required less non labor expenses including hardware and third party software 
sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expense decreased million  or  to million in from million in our sales and marketing expenses have decreased largely due to reduced headcount and the alignment of resources with products and services to more effectively target certain markets while reducing overall operating expenses 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense decreased million  or  to million in from million in the decrease in general and administrative expenses reflects savings realized through combining systems and processes of acquired companies into our central operations and reduced headcount 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization of property and equipment increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase in depreciation and amortization expense is due to the increase in equipment acquired for our network operations center  software testing and local area network lan updates 
amortization of software development costs 
amortization of software development costs were million in  consistent with amortization of million 
amortization expense as a percentage 
table of contents of software license fees decreased to in from in as a result of the increase in software license fee revenue in as compared to the same period in amortization of intangibles and impairment charge 
amortization of intangibles and impairment charge aggregated million in compared to million for the decrease is due to an impairment charge of million that was recorded in september  of which approximately million related to goodwill and million related to acquired technology 
the remaining identifiable intangible asset of approximately million consists of a tradename acquired in the xypoint acquisition that will be amortized over its remaining useful life of months 
acquired in process research and development 
in connection with our acquisition of xypoint in january  we allocated million of the million purchase price to in process research and development projects 
at the time of the acquisition  there were six technologies underway 
in september  we ceased further development of two technologies nomad and info link as we did not believe that market demand was sufficient to warrant further development and commitment of resources 
as of december   the remaining four technologies that were underway as of the acquisition have been completed and have been incorporated into our e service bureau offering  voyager platform and tcs xypoint location platform 
we completed the core development of these technologies within our original estimate of million 
the four completed technologies will continue to be enhanced as our product offerings and platforms evolve 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million to million in compared to million in the increase in interest expense is due to the increases in capital leases in and fees associated with obtaining our line of credit in other income 
other income was million in compared to million in the decrease is due primarily to a decrease in interest income earned 
the decrease in interest income earned is primarily a result of the decrease in our cash balance and lower interest rates 
the decrease in interest income earned is partially offset by a foreign currency transaction gain of million in also included in other income for is million of expense related to recording our foreign currency forward contract at fair value 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue 
total revenue increased million  or  to million in from million in total network software revenue decreased million  or  to million in from million in network software license revenue decreased million  or  to million in from million in this decrease is a result of a slowdown in carrier purchases of licenses during the second half of as compared to network software service revenue decreased million  or  to million in from million in that decrease was a result of lower fees from deployment of our software products 
service bureau revenue was million in due to the addition of enhanced to our suite of products and services 
network solutions revenue decreased million  or  to million in from million in the decrease in network solutions revenue is due to the completion of a major contract and fewer relocation services contracts 
direct cost of revenue 
total direct cost of revenue increased million  or  to million in from million in as a percentage of revenue  direct cost of revenue decreased to in from in direct cost of network software decreased million  or  to million in from million in the decrease in direct cost of network software is due to lower hardware sales for our wireless internet gateway product

table of contents direct cost of network solutions decreased million  or  to million in from million in the decrease in direct cost of network solutions is due to the decrease in the volume of business in as a percentage of related revenue  direct cost of network solutions increased to in from in due to decreased revenue for research and development expense 
research and development expense increased million  or  to million in from million in the expansion of our network software group to include location based wireless technology accounted for million of the increase in research and development 
the remaining increase was a result of devoting additional resources to the development of wireless internet gateway products and our prepaid product 
sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expense increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase reflects the hiring sales and marketing personnel as well as developing marketing tools  participating in trade shows and other similar activities to promote our products and services to carriers outside of the lucent channel as well as to enterprises 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense increased million  or  to million in from million in a portion of the increase  approximately million  is related to the addition of our location based wireless technology business in january the remaining increase is due to additional expenses related to the expansion of our facilities to support the increased volume of software development and other business activities  as well as additional expenses incurred in connection with our operation as a public company 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization of property and equipment increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase is primarily related to million of depreciation expense recorded for property and equipment related to our location based wireless technology business acquired in and the increase in property and equipment acquired under capital leases 
amortization of software development costs 
amortization of software development costs increased to million in from million in this increase was the result of the general release of enhancements to our software products that have increased our capitalized software development costs subject to amortization 
amortization expense as a percentage of software license fees increased to in from in due to a decrease in software license fee revenue in amortization of goodwill and other intangibles 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles relating to our acquisitions of xypoint in january and reachnet in february aggregated million for in connection with the xypoint and reachnet acquisitions  we recorded goodwill of approximately million  which was being amortized on a straight line basis over a four year period 
we also recorded million and million in other intangibles related to workforce in place and tradename  respectively  in connection with the xypoint acquisition 
see impairment of goodwill and other intangibles for a discussion of the impairment recognized during the third quarter of and management s assessment of recoverability of the remaining intangible assets 
acquired in process research and development 
in connection with the acquisition of xypoint in january  we allocated million of the million purchase price to in process research and development projects 
this allocation represents the estimated fair value based on discounted cash flows related to the incomplete research and development projects 
at the time of acquisition  the progress of these technologies had not yet reached technological feasibility and the technologies had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these costs were expensed as of the acquisition date 
at december   four of the six technologies that were underway as of the acquisition remain on target with our original plans and projections 
we ceased further development of the two remaining technologies nomad and infolink as we did not believe that market demand was sufficient to warrant further development and commitment of resources 
for the four technologies remaining under development  we believe these research and development technologies are on track with management s plans at the time the acquisition occurred 

table of contents funding for such technologies is expected to be from our remaining initial public offering proceeds and internally generated sources 
although we intend to complete the development of these technologies and management believes in the likelihood of their feasibility  there can be no assurance that such projects will be completed successfully  or that upon completion such technologies will achieve commercial success 
impairment of goodwill and other intangibles 
in connection with the acquisition of xypoint and reachnet in the first quarter  we recorded goodwill and other intangible assets of approximately million 
we also immediately expensed million as acquired in process technology upon completion of the xypoint acquisition 
during the quarter ended september   we performed an impairment assessment of the identifiable intangibles and goodwill recorded upon the acquisitions of xypoint and reachnet 
the assessment was performed as a result of the decision by management to discontinue the further development of certain products acquired in the acquisitions and current competitive influences related to these businesses 
based on these factors  it was determined that the goodwill and other intangible assets may have become impaired as of september  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  an undiscounted cash flow analysis of our acquisitions was performed to determine whether an impairment existed 
because the undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying value of the net assets of these businesses  we determined that the intangible assets were impaired 
to calculate the amount of the impairment  we estimated the fair value of the net assets using a discounted cash flow analysis 
we used a discount rate of and estimated revenues and costs based on current projections which take into account current and expected market conditions and our past experience 
an impairment charge of million was recorded  which represents the difference between the carrying value and fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets 
the remaining identifiable intangible assets of approximately million consist of the developed technology and tradename acquired in the xypoint acquisition and will continue to be amortized over the remaining useful life of months 
interest expense 
interest expense was million in compared to million in the decrease in interest expense is a result of paying off our debt in august after our initial public offering 
other income 
other income was million in compared to million in the decrease is a result of the decrease in cash balances during available for investment 
income taxes because we have incurred net losses since  no provision for federal or state income taxes has been made for the years ended december  and from january  through december   we elected to be treated as an s corporation for federal income tax purposes under subchapter s of the code and accordingly  we were not subject to federal and state income taxes during that period 
we terminated our s corporation status on december   and upon termination determined the differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of its assets and liabilities 
these differences were recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities  and the net difference was reported as income tax expense in we recorded million of income tax expense for the period from december  through december   primarily representing deferred taxes incurred as a result of deducting software development costs for tax purposes when incurred  rather than capitalizing and amortizing such costs in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for financial reporting purposes 
we recorded a million tax benefit in the year ended december   which resulted from our ability to reduce our deferred tax liabilities by the tax effect of our net operating loss for the period 
liquidity and capital resources we have funded our recent operations and capital expenditures primarily using net proceeds from our initial public offering in august  which generated cash of approximately million  as well as revenue from our operations and various borrowing arrangements 
in  our borrowing arrangements provided funding primarily through capital lease obligations 
during the second half of  as an alternative to leasing  
table of contents we borrowed million under a long term debt arrangement to fund fixed asset purchases 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and working capital of million 
in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities our net cash used in operating activities was million in  million in and million in the million in net cash used in operating activities for reflects a net loss of million  partly offset by non cash expenses of million and a net increase in operating assets and liabilities of million 
the changes in our operating assets and liabilities vary primarily based on the timing of billings and collections for long term projects and license sales 
loss before non cash charges decreased to million in from million income before non cash charges was million in loss before non cash charges decreased in due to a million increase in gross profit and a decrease in research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  million in and million in in  cash used in investing activities includes million for the development of our software products and million for the purchase of property and equipment 
we also received payments on notes receivable from employees during the year  which accounted for million of net cash provided by investing activities 
see related party transactions for a discussion of these notes receivable 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  million in and million in in  we repaid capital lease obligations of million 
we also generated million of cash from the proceeds of long term debt 
the terms of the debt are described in detail below 
in may  we entered into an agreement with silicon valley bank for a million line of credit 
we can borrow an amount equal to up to of receivables less than days old 
the line of credit is secured by accounts receivable and bears interest at prime plus at december  
the line of credit will expire in april as of december   we had million available and unused under the line of credit and as of february   there were no borrowings outstanding under the line of credit 
during the second half of  we borrowed approximately million to primarily fund equipment purchases 
the debt bears interest at and is secured by the accounts receivable of one customer 
on september  we acquired substantially all of the assets of open telephone network  inc the purchase price of approximately million includes million of common stock  million of cash payments and million of acquisition and integration costs 
we issued  shares of class a common stock  valued at per share  the average market price per share of our class a common stock for the period two days before and including september   the closing date of the acquisition 
an additional  shares of our class a common stock are being held in escrow until gross profits of million related to otelnet products is realized 
if the gross profit target is not met by december   then the shares held in escrow will be returned to us 
additional contingent consideration will be calculated as a percentage of gross profits achieved 
for example  if gross profits from the sale of otelnet products reach million by december  and are over and above the criteria to earn the escrow shares  the value of the additional consideration would be million 
there are no contingent payments beyond the year ended december  the additional payments can be made either in cash or class a common stock at our option 
any contingent payments made will be accounted for as additional consideration 
the additional payments can be made either in cash or class a common stock at our option 
no contingent payments were made for the year ended december  as of december   our most significant commitments consisted of long term debt  obligations under capital leases and non cancelable operating leases 
we lease certain furniture and computer equipment 
table of contents under capital leases 
we lease office space and equipment under non cancelable operating leases
