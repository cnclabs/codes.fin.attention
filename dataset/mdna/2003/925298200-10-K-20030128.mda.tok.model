the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following are critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we derive revenue from two sources as follows i sale of software licenses to end users  value added resellers var s  distributors  system integrators and independent software vendors isv s  and ii services which include consulting  training  and post contract customer support pcs 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position  software revenue recognition sop  as amended 
under sop  we record revenue from licensing of software products to end users and system integrators  who use our software to build systems for their customers  when both parties sign a license agreement  the fee is fixed or determinable  collection is reasonably assured and delivery of the product has occurred 
for var s and distributors  we recognize revenue upon notification of sell through  provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
for sales to certain isv s  where we receive non refundable royalty payments  we defer the fair value of pcs related to the arrangement and recognize the remainder as license revenue  when paid  provided all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
generally  we provide payment terms that range from thirty to ninety days from the invoice date 
accordingly  payment terms that exceed ninety days are not considered fixed or determinable and revenue is recognized as payments become due 
when contracts contain multiple elements  and for which vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for the undelivered elements  we recognize revenue for the delivered elements based upon the residual method 
vsoe is generally the price for products sold separately or 
table of contents the renewal rate in the agreement for pcs 
undelivered elements consist primarily of pcs and other services such as consulting  mentoring and training 
services are generally not considered essential to the functionality of the software 
we recognize revenue allocated to pcs ratably over the period of the contracts  which is generally twelve months 
for revenue related to consulting services  we recognize revenue as the related services are performed 
in instances where services are deemed essential to the software  both the software license fee and consulting fees are recognized using the percentage of completion method of contract accounting 
the portion of fees related to either products delivered or services rendered which are not due under our company s standard payment terms are reflected in deferred revenue and in unbilled receivables 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made in connection with determination of the revenue to be recognized in any accounting period 
if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates for any period  material differences in the amount and timing of revenue recognized could result 
determining functional currencies for the purpose of consolidation we have several foreign subsidiaries  which together account for approximately of our net revenues for the year ended october   and of our assets and of our total liabilities as of october  in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to translate the financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries from the currency in which they keep their accounting records  generally the local currency  into united states dollars 
this process results in exchange gains and losses which  under the relevant accounting guidance  are either included within the statement of operations or as a separate part of our stockholders equity under the caption cumulative translation adjustment 
if any subsidiary s functional currency is deemed to be the local currency  then any gain or loss associated with the translation of that subsidiary s financial statements is included in cumulative translation adjustments 
if we dispose of any of our subsidiaries  any cumulative translation gains or losses would be realized in our statement of operations 
if we determine that there has been a change in the functional currency of a subsidiary to the united states dollar  any translation gains or losses arising after the date of change would be included within our statement of operations 
the magnitude of these gains or losses is dependent upon movements in the exchange rates of the foreign currencies in which we transact business against the united states dollar 
these currencies include the united kingdom pound sterling  the euro  the indian rupee  australian and canadian dollars 
any future translation gains or losses could be significantly higher than those noted in each of these periods 
in addition  if we determine that a change in the functional currency of one of our subsidiaries has occurred at any point in time  we would be required to include any translation gains or losses from the date of change in our statement of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful 
provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices 
for those invoices not specifically reviewed  provisions are provided at differing rates  based upon the age of the receivable 
in determining these percentages  we analyze our historical collection experience and current economic trends 
if the historical data we use to calculate the allowance provided for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and the future results of operations could be materially affected 
contingencies with the exception of the  deductible amount of directors and officers liability insurance paid in april  and the  expensed in the fourth quarter of fiscal  no estimate can be made of the 
table of contents ultimate loss or possible loss associated with the resolution of these contingencies 
as additional information becomes available  we will assess the potential liability related to our preliminary settlement and revise our estimates 
such revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
we do not currently use derivative financial instruments 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks including changes in interest rates affecting the return on its investments and  to a lesser extent  foreign currency fluctuations 
in the normal course of business  we establish policies and procedures to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency values 
interest rate risks 
we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  consisting principally of investments in commercial paper  interest bearing demand deposit accounts with financial institutions  money market funds and highly liquid debt securities of corporations  municipalities and the us government 
these investments are denominated in us dollars 
cash balances in foreign currencies overseas are operating balances and are invested in short term time deposits of the local operating bank 
all of the cash equivalents  short term and long term investments are treated as available for sale 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have seen a decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
however  the company reduces its interest rate risk by investing its cash in instruments with short maturities 
our exposure  on our portfolio of marketable investments  to changes in short term interest rates is insignificant as of october  because the average holding period until maturity of our cash equivalents and short term investments was approximately days 
the table below presents the principal amount and related weighted average interest rates for our investment portfolio 
short term investments are all in fixed rate instruments

as of october   versata had operating subsidiaries located in the united kingdom  germany  france  canada  and australia 
our revenue outside north america was for the year ended october  the only geographic sub region with revenue greater than of total revenue in fiscal was germany with 
international sales were made mostly from the company s foreign sales subsidiaries in the local countries and are typically denominated in the local currency of each country 
these 
table of contents subsidiaries also incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
the company s international business is subject to risks typical of an international business  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange volatility 
accordingly  the company s future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
the company is also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall financial results 
we do not currently enter into foreign currency hedge transactions 
through october   foreign currency fluctuations have not had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations

we adopted this provision during the current fiscal year 
historically  we netted reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses against the related expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the adoption of eitf had no impact on our gross margin or net loss  but did cause both services revenue and cost of services revenue to increase by approximately  and  for the year ended october  and the ten months ended october   respectively 
we did not reclassify prior period results for the years ended december  or as the adoption of eitf did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows for these periods 
we believe the results as previously reported are comparable
