previously  such costs were deferred and amortized over the month period following restaurant openings 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes found elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
as of march   we operated upscale  high volume  casual dining restaurants under the cheesecake factory mark 
we also operated three upscale casual dining restaurants under the grand lux cafe mark in los angeles  california  chicago  illinois and las vegas  nevada  one self service  limited menu express foodservice operation under the cheesecake factory express mark inside the disneyquest family entertainment center in orlando  florida  and a bakery production facility 
we also licensed three limited menu bakery cafes under the cheesecake factory bakery cafe mark to another foodservice operator 
our revenues consist of sales from our restaurant operations and sales from our bakery operations to other foodservice operators  retailers and distributors bakery sales 
revenue from restaurant sales is recognized when food and beverage products are sold to our guests 
revenue from bakery sales to other foodservice operators  retailers and distributors is recognized when the products are shipped 
sales and cost of sales are reported separately for restaurant and bakery activities 
all other operating cost and expense categories are reported on a combined basis for both restaurant and bakery activities 
comparable restaurant sales include the sales from restaurants open for the full period of each period being compared 
new restaurants enter the comparable sales base in their nineteenth month of operation 
we utilize a week fiscal year ending on the tuesday closest to december for financial reporting purposes 
fiscal and each consisted of weeks  while fiscal consisted of weeks 
fiscal will consist of weeks and will end on december  results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the consolidated statements of operations of the company expressed as percentages of total revenues 
fiscal year revenues restaurant sales bakery sales to other foodservice operators  retailers and distributors total revenues costs and expenses restaurant cost of sales bakery cost of sales labor expenses other operating costs and expenses general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization expenses preopening costs total costs and expenses income from operations interest income  net other income expense  net income before income taxes income tax provision net income fiscal compared to fiscal revenues total revenues increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal restaurant sales increased to million for fiscal compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
the increase of million for fiscal consisted of the following components million from the openings of twelve new restaurants during the fiscal year  million from restaurants opened prior to fiscal that were not considered comparable sales during fiscal  and million from comparable restaurant sales 
total restaurant operating weeks and estimated productive square feet increased approximately and to  and  respectively  during fiscal a single restaurant open during the full period of fiscal would have generated operating weeks 
productive square feet consists of interior plus seasonally adjusted patio square feet 
we believe that measuring the changes in total restaurant operating weeks and total productive square feet from period to period is the most effective way to analyze the growth of the total productive capacity of our restaurant operations 
average sales per restaurant operating week for restaurants open during the full fiscal year decreased slightly to  in fiscal compared to  for fiscal this slight decrease was principally due to sales for several of our newer restaurants that experienced expected decreases to their sustainable run rate levels after their honeymoon opening period 
refer to part i business new restaurant sales and investment characteristics in this annual report on form k 
the average sales per week statistic for any period can also be impacted by the absolute size and productive capacity of new restaurants opened and the number of restaurants opened for new concepts such as grand lux cafe that  by definition  could initially be less productive than our established concepts 
comparable restaurant sales increased approximately during fiscal this increase was due almost entirely to effective menu price increases totaling approximately for the full fiscal year 
since most of our established restaurants currently operate close to full capacity during the peak demand periods of lunch and dinner  and given our industry leading annual sales productivity per productive square foot of approximately  we generally do not expect to achieve increases in comparable sales other than our effective menu price increases 
potential menu price increases must be carefully considered in light of their ultimate acceptability by our restaurant guests 
additionally  other factors outside of our control  such as inclement weather  holidays  general economic and competitive conditions and other factors referenced in this form k can impact sales volumes in our established restaurants 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that increases in comparable sales will be achieved 
bakery sales to other foodservice operators  retailers and distributors bakery sales increased to million in fiscal compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
the increase in bakery sales was principally attributable to higher sales volumes to new and established foodservice accounts and to warehouse club operators 
sales to warehouse club operators represented approximately of total bakery sales for fiscal compared to for fiscal despite the increase in bakery sales for the full year  bakery sales during the second half of fiscal were impacted by a voluntary withdrawal and recall of bakery products that were produced in the company s bakery production facility during a four day period in july due to possible bacteria contamination 
costs and expenses associated with the product withdrawal and recall are reflected in the other operating expenses category 
as a result of the product withdrawal and recall  bakery sales of approximately million that had been recorded prior to the product withdrawal and recall were reversed  and a large account foodservice industry customer discontinued purchasing our products 
while our bakery operations have requalified to do business with that customer  purchase activity has not yet resumed 
restaurant cost of sales restaurant cost of sales increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to the increase in restaurant sales during fiscal as a percentage of restaurant sales  these costs decreased to during fiscal compared to for the prior fiscal year  principally as a result of lower market prices in general for most of the food commodities used in our restaurants  coupled with increased volume purchase discounts that resulted from our increasing purchasing power 
assuming that weather or other market conditions outside of our control do not disrupt the current favorable food cost environment  we currently expect the cost for most of our contractible commodities to remain approximately the same during fiscal as experienced during fiscal the menu at our restaurants is one of the most diversified in the foodservice industry and  accordingly  is not overly dependent on a single commodity 
the principal commodity categories for our restaurants include produce  poultry  meat  fish and seafood  cheese  other dairy products  bread and general grocery items 
while we have taken steps to qualify multiple suppliers and enter into agreements for some of the key commodities used in our restaurant operations  there can be no assurance that future supplies and costs for commodities used in our restaurant operations will not fluctuate due to weather and other market conditions outside of our control 
approximately one third of our restaurant cost of sales consists of fresh produce  poultry and dairy commodities that can be subject to supply and cost fluctuations due principally to weather and other general agricultural conditions 
for new restaurants  cost of sales will typically be higher than normal during the first days of operations until our management team at each new restaurant becomes more accustomed to optimally predicting  managing and servicing the high sales volumes typically experienced by our restaurants 
bakery cost of sales bakery cost of sales  which include ingredient  packaging and production supply costs  were million for fiscal compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
the increase of million was principally attributable to the increase in bakery sales for fiscal as a percentage of bakery sales  bakery cost of sales decreased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to a shift in the mix of sales to products with slightly lower cost of sales as a percentage of their associated price but with slightly higher selling expenses  which are included in the other operating costs and expenses category 
while we have taken steps to qualify multiple suppliers and enter into agreements for some of the key commodities used in our bakery operations  there can be no assurance that future supplies and costs for commodities used in our bakery or restaurant operations will not fluctuate due to weather and other market conditions beyond our control 
cream cheese is the most significant commodity used in our bakery products  with an expected requirement for as much as million pounds during fiscal during the first quarter of fiscal  we executed agreements for substantially all of our cream cheese requirements for the month period thereafter with two suppliers at a fixed cost per pound that is slightly lower than the actual cost in fiscal we may also purchase cream cheese on the spot market as necessary to supplement our agreements 
labor expenses labor expenses  which include restaurant level labor costs and bakery direct production labor including associated fringe benefits  increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally due to the increase in total revenues during fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  labor expenses increased slightly to for fiscal compared to for fiscal reflecting increased costs for employee health insurance benefits and slightly higher labor costs for our two newest grand lux cafe locations  partially offset by labor productivity improvements 
for new restaurants  labor expenses will typically be higher than normal during the first days of operations until our management team at each new restaurant becomes more accustomed to optimally predicting  managing and servicing the high sales volumes typically experienced by our restaurants 
other operating costs and expenses other operating costs and expenses consist of restaurant level occupancy expenses rent  insurance  licenses and taxes  and utilities  other operating expenses excluding food costs and labor expenses reported separately and bakery production overhead  selling and distribution expenses 
other operating costs and expenses increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally attributable to the increase in total revenues for fiscal as well as cost and expenses related to the bakery product withdrawal 
as a percentage of total revenues  other operating costs and expenses increased to for fiscal versus for fiscal costs and expenses associated with the bakery product withdrawal were approximately million or of total revenues 
other operating expenses were also impacted by higher costs for our insurance arrangements  which increased approximately as a percent of total revenues 
we expect the costs for all of our insurance arrangements to continue to increase during fiscal general and administrative expenses general and administrative g a expenses consist of the restaurant management recruiting and training program  the restaurant field supervision organization  the bakery administrative organization and the corporate support organization 
g a expenses increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally due to the planned growth our supervision and support organizations commensurate with the growth of our restaurant and bakery operations during fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  g a expenses decreased to for fiscal compared to for the prior fiscal year as the increase in these expenses for fiscal was less than the increase in total revenues for the year 
during fiscal  we plan to continue to add resources to the corporate support  training and field supervision activities of our business  commensurate with the planned openings of as many as new restaurants during the year 
g a expenses for fiscal will also reflect the full year impact of the new leased training  culinary r d and office space occupied by the company in october  as well as new executive positions added to our field supervision organization and other investments to support our future growth 
accordingly  the rate of growth of g a expenses compared to the immediate preceding year is expected to be slightly higher for fiscal compared to fiscal depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally due to new restaurant openings 
as a percentage of total revenues  depreciation and amortization expenses were and for fiscal and  respectively 
preopening costs preopening costs increased to million for fiscal compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
we opened twelve restaurants during fiscal compared to nine openings during fiscal preopening costs include incremental out of pocket costs that are directly related to the openings of new restaurants that are not otherwise capitalizable 
as a result of the highly customized and operationally complex nature of our upscale  high volume concepts  the restaurant preopening process for our new restaurants is more extensive  time consuming and costly relative to that of most chain restaurant operations 
the preopening cost for one of our restaurants usually includes costs to relocate and compensate an average of restaurant management employees prior to opening  costs to recruit and train an average of hourly restaurant employees  wages  travel and lodging costs for our opening training team and other support employees  and costs for practice service activities 
preopening costs will vary from location to location depending on a number of factors  including the proximity of our existing restaurants  the size and physical layout of each location  the number of management and hourly employees required to open each restaurant  the relative difficulty of the restaurant staffing process  the cost of travel and lodging for different metropolitan areas  and the extent of unexpected delays  if any  in construction and or obtaining final licenses and permits to open the restaurants  which may also be caused by landlord delays 
our direct preopening cost for a  square foot  single story restaurant in an established company market averages approximately  there will also be other preopening costs associated with each restaurant opening  including costs for corporate travel and support activities 
preopening costs will usually be higher for larger restaurants  our initial entry into new markets and for new concepts such as grand lux cafe 
we usually incur the most significant portion of preopening costs for a typical restaurant opening within the two month period immediately preceding and the month of the restaurant s opening 
preopening costs will fluctuate from period to period  based on the number and timing of restaurant openings and the specific preopening costs incurred for each restaurant  and the fluctuations could be significant 
we expense preopening costs as incurred 
based on our current growth objectives for fiscal and  preopening costs for each of those years will likely exceed the respective amount of preopening costs for the applicable prior year 
interest income  other income expense  net and income taxes interest income decreased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this decrease was principally due to lower yields on our interest bearing cash and short term investments that  in turn  was attributable to the decline in the general level of interest rates during fiscal we invest our excess cash balances in us treasury and agency securities  investment grade corporate debt securities rated a or better and money market mutual funds 
other income for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally due to higher gains on the sales of investments and marketable securities in order to fund the company s working capital requirements 
our effective income tax rate was for fiscal compared to for fiscal for fiscal  we currently estimate our effective tax rate to remain at 
the actual effective tax rate for fiscal may be different than our current estimate due to actual revenues  taxable income and tax credits achieved during the year 
fiscal weeks compared to fiscal weeks revenues total revenues increased to million for the weeks of fiscal compared to million for the weeks of fiscal after adjusting for the extra week in fiscal  total revenues for fiscal would have increased by approximately 
restaurant sales increased to million for the weeks of fiscal compared to million for the weeks in the prior fiscal year 
restaurant sales would have increased by for fiscal after adjusting for approximately million of sales for the extra week in fiscal the resulting restaurant sales increase of million for fiscal on a week basis consisted of the following components million from the openings of nine new restaurants during the fiscal year  million from restaurants opened during fiscal that were not considered comparable sales during fiscal  and million from comparable restaurant sales 
total restaurant operating weeks and estimated productive square feet increased approximately and to  and  respectively  during fiscal on a week basis 
average sales per restaurant operating week for restaurants open during the full fiscal year increased to  compared to  for fiscal on a week basis 
comparable restaurant sales increased approximately during fiscal this increase was partially attributable to effective menu price increases totaling approximately for the full fiscal year  offset in part by reduced guest traffic in several of our higher profile restaurants after the events of september  bakery sales to other foodservice operators  retailers and distributors bakery sales increased to million for the weeks in fiscal compared to million for the weeks in the prior fiscal year 
after adjusting for the extra week in fiscal  bakery sales would have increased approximately during fiscal the increase in bakery sales was principally attributable to higher sales volumes to new and established foodservice accounts and to warehouse club operators 
sales to warehouse club operators represented approximately of total bakery sales for fiscal compared to for fiscal restaurant cost of sales restaurant cost of sales increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to the increase in restaurant sales during fiscal as a percentage of restaurant sales  these costs remained relatively constant at during fiscal compared to for the prior fiscal year 
bakery cost of sales bakery cost of sales was million for fiscal compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
the increase of million was principally attributable to the increase in bakery sales for fiscal as a percentage of bakery sales  bakery cost of sales increased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to a shift in the mix of sales to products with slightly higher cost of sales as a percentage of their associated price but with slightly lower selling expenses  which are included in the other operating costs and expenses category and a slight increase in the cost for certain dairy related commodities that are not subject to annual fixed price contracts 
labor expenses labor expenses increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally due to the increase in total revenues during fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  labor expenses increased slightly to for fiscal compared to for fiscal other operating costs and expenses other operating costs and expenses increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally attributable to the increase in total revenues for fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  other operating costs and expenses increased slightly to for fiscal versus for fiscal  principally due to higher costs for electric and natural gas services and increased costs for our insurance arrangements  which reflected the general increase in such costs resulting from the terrorist attacks of september  general and administrative expenses g a expenses increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally due to the planned growth of our supervision and support organizations commensurate with the growth of our restaurant and bakery operations during fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  g a expenses decreased slightly to for fiscal compared to for the prior fiscal year 
depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally due to new restaurant openings 
as a percentage of total revenues  depreciation and amortization expenses were and for fiscal and  respectively 
preopening costs preopening costs increased to million for fiscal compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
we opened nine restaurants during fiscal compared to seven restaurant openings during fiscal interest income  other income expense  net interest income decreased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal this decrease was principally due to lower yields on our interest bearing cash and short term investments due to the decline in the general level of interest rates during fiscal other income expense  net for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal this increase was principally due to gains recognized in fiscal on the sale of short term investments compared to a one time write off of the remaining net book value of our former restaurant point of sale pos system in the prior fiscal year 
liquidity and capital resources the following table presents  for the periods indicated  a summary of the company s key liquidity measurements 
fiscal year dollar amounts in millions cash and marketable securities on hand  end of year net working capital  end of year adjusted net working capital  end of year current ratio  end of year adjusted current ratio  end of year long term debt  end of year cash provided by operations capital expenditures fiscal consisted of weeks 
all other fiscal years consisted of weeks 
includes all marketable securities classified as either current or noncurrent assets 
during fiscal  our total amount of cash and marketable securities on hand increased by million to million as of december  this increase was principally due to increased cash flow from operations and proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options 
in the table above  we also present adjusted net working capital and current ratio calculations that include all marketable securities classified as either current or noncurrent assets 
we believe these adjusted calculations more properly reflect our overall liquidity position 
in response to the recent decrease in the general level of interest rates and our forecasted cash flow requirements  we have been slightly lengthening the average maturity of our marketable securities portfolio in order to capture additional investment yield 
as a result  most of our investments in marketable securities now have maturities in excess of one year and are classified as noncurrent assets  but remain available for our liquidity requirements 
as of march   there were no borrowings outstanding under our million revolving credit and term loan facility the credit facility 
million of the credit facility has been reserved to support standby letters of credit for our self insurance programs 
borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at variable rates based  at our option  on either the prime rate of interest  the lending institution s cost of funds plus  or the applicable libor rate plus 
the credit facility expires on may  on that date  a maximum of million of any borrowings outstanding under the credit facility automatically convert into a four year term loan  payable in equal quarterly installments at interest rates of higher than the applicable revolving credit rates 
the credit facility is not collateralized and requires us to maintain certain financial ratios and to observe certain restrictive covenants with respect to the conduct of our operations  with which we are currently in compliance 
our new restaurant development model more closely resembles that of a retail business that occupies leased space in shopping malls  office complexes  strip centers  entertainment centers and other real estate developments 
we typically seek to lease our restaurant locations for primary periods of to years 
our rent structures vary from lease to lease  but generally provide for the payment of both minimum and contingent percentage rent based on sales 
we expend cash for leasehold improvements and furnishings  fixtures and equipment to build out the leased premises 
we may also expend cash for permanent improvements that we make to leased premises that will be reimbursed to us by our landlords as construction contributions also known as tenant improvement allowances pursuant to agreed upon terms in the respective leases 
if obtained  landlord construction contributions usually take the form of up front cash  full or partial credits against minimum or percentage rents otherwise payable by us  or a combination thereof 
we initially record uncollected landlord construction contributions as other receivables 
our balance of other receivables will fluctuate from period to period  depending on the timing of cash collections from landlords and additional receivables recorded from new restaurant development activities 
see note  other receivables to our consolidated financial statements 
in the future  we may also develop more freestanding restaurant locations using both ground leases and built to suit leases  which are common arrangements used to finance freestanding locations in the restaurant industry 
we do not have any current plans to encumber our existing leasehold interests with secured financing 
we own substantially all of the equipment  furniture and trade fixtures in our restaurants and currently plan to do so in the future 
during fiscal  our cash outlays and accrued liability for capital expenditures were approximately million 
of that amount  approximately million was related to new restaurant openings including several restaurants under development as of december  
the remainder consisted of approximately million for maintenance and capacity addition outlays for our existing restaurants  approximately million to build out new leased space for additional training  culinary r d and office space next to our existing corporate facility  and approximately million for bakery and corporate capital expenditures 
for fiscal  we currently estimate our total capital expenditures to range between million  net of agreed upon landlord construction contributions and excluding million of expected noncapitalizable preopening costs for new restaurants 
this estimate contemplates million for as many as new restaurants to be opened during fiscal  which includes an estimated increase in construction in progress disbursements for anticipated fiscal openings and which also reflects the fact that three of our planned restaurant openings for fiscal do not have any landlord construction contributions 
not every potential location that we seek to develop into a restaurant may have landlord construction contributions available  and we would therefore not generally incur a contingent rent obligation on such locations 
expected capital expenditures for fiscal also include approximately million for maintenance and capacity addition expenditures to our existing restaurants  and million for potential bakery capacity additions 
based on our current expansion objectives  we believe that our cash and short term investments on hand  combined with expected cash flow provided by operations  available borrowings under our credit facility and expected landlord construction contributions should be sufficient in the aggregate to finance our planned capital expenditures and other operating activities through fiscal we may seek additional funds to finance our growth in the future 
however  there can be no assurance that such funds will be available when needed or be available on terms acceptable to us 
during fiscal  our board of directors authorized the company to repurchase up to  shares of our common stock for reissuance upon the exercise of stock options under our current stock option plans 
shares may be repurchased in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions at times and prices considered appropriate by us 
under this authorization  we have repurchased a total of  shares for a total cost of million through december  as of march   we had no financing transactions  arrangements or other relationships with any unconsolidated entities or related parties 
additionally  we had no financing arrangements involving synthetic leases or trading activities involving commodity contracts 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following schedules summarize our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  amounts in millions total after contractual obligations operating leases other commercial commitments standby letters of credit critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that we believe are most important to portraying our financial condition and results of operations and also require the greatest amount of subjective or complex judgments by management 
judgments or uncertainties regarding the application of these policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
property and equipment we record all property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation 
improvements are capitalized while repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred 
depreciation is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the assets or the primary lease terms of the respective leases 
the useful life of property and equipment and the determination as to what constitutes a capitalized cost versus a repair and maintenance expense involves judgments by management 
these judgments may produce materially different amounts of depreciation expense if different assumptions were used 
self insurance liability we are self insured for a significant portion of our employee health  workers compensation and general liability programs 
the company maintains stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit its total exposure 
the accrued liability associated with these programs is based on our estimate of the ultimate costs to be incurred to settle known claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date 
our estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors  including historical trends  actuarial assumptions and economic conditions 
if actual trends  including the severity or frequency of claims  differ from our estimates  our financial results could be impacted 
income taxes we estimate certain components of our provision for income taxes 
these estimates include  but are not limited to  effective state and local income tax rates  allowable tax credits for items such as fica taxes paid on reported tip income  and estimates related to depreciation expense allowable for tax purposes 
our estimates are made based on the best available information at the time that we prepare the provision 
we usually file our income tax returns many months after our fiscal year end 
all tax returns are subject to audit by federal and state governments  usually years after the returns are filed  and could be subject to differing interpretations of the tax laws 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board fasb recently issued several statements of financial accounting standards sfas 
the statements relevant to our line of business and their impact on the company are as follows sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets will no longer be amortized but must be tested for impairment at least annually 
this statement became effective in january and did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit and disposal activities  is effective for exit and disposal activities initiated after december  through february   this standard did not have any effect on our consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of sfas no 
 provides alternative methods for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation as required by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
this statement also requires additional disclosure related to stock based employee compensation in interim financial reporting 
this statement is effective for fiscal years ending after december  this statement did not have any impact on our consolidated financial statements as we have adopted the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 
the additional disclosure requirements will be reflected in our next interim financial reports 
impact of inflation and changes in the costs of key operating resources our profitability is dependent  among other things  upon our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the costs of key operating resources  including food and other raw materials  labor  energy and other supplies and services 
while we have taken steps to qualify multiple suppliers and enter into agreements for some of the commodities used in our restaurant and bakery operations  there can be no assurance that future supplies and costs for such commodities will not fluctuate due to weather and other market conditions outside of our control 
we are currently unable to contract for substantially all of our fresh commodities such as produce  poultry  meat  fish and dairy items for long periods of time and  consequently  such commodities can be subject to unforeseen supply and cost fluctuations 
dairy costs can also fluctuate due to government regulation 
the impact of inflation on food  labor  energy and occupancy costs can significantly affect our restaurant and bakery operations 
many of our restaurant and bakery employees are paid hourly rates related to the federal minimum wage  which increased in   and proposals are currently pending in congress to again increase the federal minimum wage 
the state of california  where we currently operate approximately one fourth of our restaurants  increased its minimum wage by per hour to in january  and by another per hour to in january additionally  a general shortage in the availability of qualified restaurant management and hourly workers in certain geographical areas in which we operate has caused related increases in the costs of recruiting and compensating such employees 
certain operating costs  such as taxes  insurance and other outside services continue to increase with the general level of inflation or higher and may also be subject to other cost and supply fluctuations outside of our control 
while the company has been able to react to inflation and other changes in the costs of key operating resources by gradually increasing prices for its menu items and bakery products  coupled with more efficient purchasing practices  productivity improvements and greater economies of scale  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in the future 
from time to time  competitive conditions could limit our menu pricing flexibility 
substantially all of the leases for our restaurants provide for contingent rent obligations based on a percentage of sales 
as a result  rent expense will absorb a proportionate share of any menu price increases in our restaurants 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate increases in comparable restaurant sales and bakery sales in amounts sufficient to offset inflationary or other cost pressures 
seasonality and quarterly results our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
historically  our highest levels of revenues and net income for our established restaurants have occurred in the second and third quarters of the fiscal year 
over one half of our restaurants are located in or near shopping centers and malls that typically experience seasonal fluctuations in sales 
patio seating represents approximately of the total available seating for all restaurants open as of march  and can be subject to disruption from inclement weather 
holidays  severe weather  storms and similar conditions may impact restaurant sales volumes seasonally in some of the markets where we operate 
our bakery operations are seasonal to the extent that the fourth quarter s sales are typically higher due to holiday business 
additionally  bakery sales comparisons may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to the timing and size of orders from our larger bakery customers 
quarterly results have been and will continue to be significantly impacted by the timing of new restaurant openings and their associated preopening costs 
as a result of these and other factors  the company s financial results for any given quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on funded debt 
this exposure relates to our million revolving credit and term loan facility the credit facility 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility during fiscal    or fiscal through march  borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at variable rates based on either the prime rate of interest  the lending institution s cost of funds plus or libor plus 
a hypothetical interest rate change would not have any current impact on our results of operations 
a change in market prices also exposes us to market risk related to our investments in marketable securities 
as of december   we held million in available for sale marketable securities 
a hypothetical decline in the market value of those securities would result in a million unrealized loss and a corresponding decline in their fair value 
this hypothetical decline would not affect our cash flow from operations and would not have an impact on net income until the securities were disposed of 
we purchase food and other commodities for use in our operations  based upon market prices established with our suppliers 
many of the commodities purchased by us can be subject to volatility due to market supply and demand factors outside of our control 
to manage this risk in part  we attempt to enter into fixed price purchase commitments  with terms typically up to one year  for many of our commodity requirements 
however  we are currently unable to contract for substantially all of our fresh commodities such as produce  poultry  fish and dairy items for periods longer than days 
dairy costs can also fluctuate due to government regulation 
we believe that substantially all of our food and supplies are available from several sources  which helps to diversify our overall commodity cost risk 
we also believe that we have the ability to increase certain menu prices  or vary certain menu items offered  in response to food commodity price increases 
some of our commodity purchase arrangements may contain contractual features that limit the price paid by establishing certain price floors or caps 
the company does not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices  since our purchase arrangements with suppliers  to the extent that we can enter into such arrangements  help control the ultimate cost that we pay
