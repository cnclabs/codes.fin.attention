seasonality and backlog perry ellis products have historically been geared towards lighter weight apparel generally worn during the spring and summer months 
perry ellis believes that this seasonality has been reduced with the introduction of fall  winter  and holiday merchandise 
the jantzen swimwear business  however  is highly seasonal in nature  with the majority of its sales occurring in perry ellis first and fourth quarter 
perry ellis higher priced products generally tend to be less sensitive to economic conditions and weather conditions 
while the variation in perry ellis sales on a quarterly basis has narrowed somewhat  seasonality can be affected by a variety of factors  including the mix of advance and fill in orders  the amount of sales to different distribution levels  and overall product mix between traditional and fashion merchandise 
perry ellis generally receives orders from its retailers approximately five to seven months prior to shipment 
for approximately of sales  perry ellis has orders from its retailers before it places orders with its suppliers 
a summary of the order and delivery cycle for perry ellis four primary selling seasons is illustrated below merchandise season advance order period delivery period to retailers spring july to september january to march summer october to december april and may fall january to march june to september holiday april to june october and november sales and receivables are recorded when inventory is shipped  with payment terms generally to days from the date of shipment 
perry ellis backlog of orders includes confirmed and unconfirmed orders  which perry ellis believes  based on industry practice and past experience  will be confirmed 
as of march   perry ellis backlog of orders for its products  all of which are expected to be shipped during fiscal  was approximately million  compared to approximately million as of march  the amount of unfilled orders at a point in time is affected by a number of factors  including the mix of product  the timing of the receipt and processing of customer orders and the scheduling of the sourcing and shipping of the product  which in most cases depends on the desires of the customer 
backlog is also affected by on going trends among customers to reduce the lead time on their orders 
since the fall of  perry ellis customers have been more cautious of their inventory levels and have delayed placing orders and re orders compared to perry ellis previous experience 
due to these factors a comparison of unfilled orders from period to period is not necessarily meaningful and may not be indicative of eventual actual shipments 
supply of products and quality control perry ellis currently uses independent contract manufacturers to supply the majority of the products it sells 
nearly of perry ellis suppliers are located in the far east  in south and central america and in the middle east 
perry ellis largest independent contract manufacturer supplied less than of perry ellis purchased product during fiscal perry ellis believes that the use of numerous independent contract manufacturers allows it to maximize production flexibility  while avoiding significant capital expenditures  work in process inventory build ups and the costs of maintaining and operating production facilities 
perry ellis has had relationships with some suppliers for as long as years  however  none of these relationships are formal or require either party to either purchase or supply any fixed quantity of product 
while perry ellis believes it is unlikely  and has never been a factor in the past  it is possible that in times of tight market supply  the absence of formal supply agreements may impair perry ellis ability to secure a reliable source of product supply 
the vast majority of perry ellis non jantzen products are purchased as full packages  where perry ellis places an order with the supplier and the supplier purchases all the raw materials  assembles the garments and ships them to perry ellis distribution facilities 
for the jantzen swimwear business  which includes the jantzen  tommy hilfiger  nike and southpoint brands  perry ellis purchases fabric from domestic and international suppliers 
purchased fabrics are primarily cut in the united states 
the cut fabric is matched with various trim components and shipped to off shore sewing contractors located primarily in mexico and the caribbean basin enabling perry ellis to utilize exemptions under customs regulations  which provide that certain articles assembled abroad from united states components are exempt from united states duties on the value of those components 
this process is generally referred to as cmt cut  make and trim and differs from full package sourcing in that perry ellis  not the supplier  purchases and owns the fabric and trim components 
perry ellis plans to ultimately shift the production of the jantzen business to the full package sourcing model 
finished goods are generally shipped to either perry ellis miami  florida or seneca  south carolina facilities or to third party warehouses in california for repackaging and distribution to customers

import and import restrictions perry ellis transactions with its foreign suppliers abroad are subject to the risks of doing business abroad 
imports into the united states are affected by  among other things  the cost of transportation of the products and the imposition of import duties and restrictions 
the countries that perry ellis sources its products from may  from time to time  impose new quotas  duties  tariffs  or other restrictions or adjust prevailing quotas  duty or tariff levels  which could affect perry ellis ability to import products at the current or increased levels 
perry ellis cannot predict the likelihood or frequency of any such events occurring 
perry ellis import operations are subject to constraints imposed by bilateral textile agreements between the united states and a number of foreign countries including china  indonesia and korea 
these agreements impose quotas on the amount and type of goods that can be imported into the united states from these countries 
such agreements also allow the united states to impose  at any time  restraints on the importation of categories of products that  under the terms of the agreements  are not subject to specified limits 
perry ellis imported products are also subject to united states customs duties and other charges 
perry ellis monitors duty  tariff  and quota related developments and continually seeks to minimize its potential exposure to quota related risks through  among other measures  geographical diversification of its contract manufacturers  the maintenance of overseas offices  allocation of overseas production to product categories where more quota is available and shifts of production among countries and manufacturers 
in addition to the factors outlined above  perry ellis import operations may be adversely affected by political or economic instability resulting in the disruption of trade from exporting countries  any significant fluctuations in the value of the dollar against foreign currencies and restrictions on the transfer of funds 
competition the retail apparel industry is highly competitive and fragmented 
perry ellis competitors include numerous apparel designers  manufacturers  importers and licensors  and its own customers private label programs  many of which are larger and have greater financial and marketing resources than it 
perry ellis believes that the principal competitive factors in the industry are brands  timeliness  reliability and quality of services provided  market share and visibility  price and fashion  and the ability to anticipate consumer demands and maintain appeal of products to customers 
perry ellis strives to focus on these points and has proven to have the ability to anticipate and respond quickly to customer demands with its brand names and range of products and its ability to operate within the industry s production and delivery constrains

perry ellis considers the level of competition and the nature of its competitors varies by product segment 
in particular  in the mass market channel  manufacturers constitute perry ellis main competitors in this less expensive segment of the market  while high profile domestic and foreign designers and licensors account for its main competitors in the more upscale segment of the market

perry ellis owns or licenses the brand names under which most of its products are sold

if the salant acquisition is completed  perry ellis will be positioned to enter the men s collection market for sportswear  dress shirts and dress pants and the leather accessories market 
with the acquisition  perry ellis will begin to design  market and license products under the axis and tricots st 
raphael brands  and under the jnco trademark for menswear 
furthermore  perry ellis will begin marketing menswear under the ocean pacific brands as a licensee  if the written consent of ocean pacific is obtained 
perry ellis also licenses its trademark portfolio domestically and internationally to third parties for apparel and various other products that perry ellis does not sell including men s and women s footwear and men s suits  underwear  loungewear  outerwear  fragrances and accessories 
in addition to generating additional sources of revenue for perry ellis  these licensing arrangements raise the overall awareness of perry ellis brands 
in addition to its sales of branded products  perry ellis sells products to retailers for marketing as private label or own store lines 
in fiscal  perry ellis sold private label products to wal mart  jc penney  goody s  k mart  target  mervyn s  meijer and sears roebuck 
private label sales generally yield lower profit margins than sales of comparable branded products 
private label sales accounted for approximately   of net sales during fiscal years  and  respectively 
the decrease in the private label business as a percentage of perry ellis net sales is a result of the additional sales of apparel under the brands acquired in the jantzen acquisition and the subsequent license agreements with nike and tommy hilfiger and perry ellis decision to focus its efforts on selling branded products 
through its family of brands marketing strategy  perry ellis seeks to develop and enhance a distinct brand name  styling and pricing strategy for each product category within each distribution channel and target consumer 
perry ellis markets its brands to a wide range of segments  targeting consumers in specific age  income and lifestyle categories 
perry ellis primarily contracts for the manufacture of its products through a worldwide network of quality manufacturers 
perry ellis currently uses approximately independent suppliers  located in the far east  other parts of asia  africa and south and central america 
perry ellis believes that its extensive sourcing experience enables it to obtain quality products on a cost effective basis 
perry ellis believes that its competitive strengths positions it well to capitalize on several trends that have affected the apparel sector in recent years 
these trends include the consolidation of the department and chain store sectors into a smaller number of stronger retailers  which represent some of perry ellis most important customers  the increased reliance of retailers on reliable suppliers with design expertise and advanced systems and technology  and the continued importance of strong brands as a source of product differentiation 
in recent years  through acquisition of brands and internal growth  perry ellis has experienced significant overall growth 
from perry ellis initial public offering in to fiscal  perry ellis has experienced a compound annual revenue growth rate of and a compound annual growth rate of in net income 
perry ellis believes that its future growth will come as a result of its continued emphasis on its existing brands  new and expanded product lines  the expected increases in its bottoms  sweaters  swimwear and accessories  domestic and international licensing businesses  multi brand development for the fast growing hispanic market and through selective acquisitions that fit strategically with perry ellis business model 
perry ellis expected future growth in these areas may be offset somewhat by a decreased focus on private label business 
the terrorist attacks of september  and subsequent increases in unemployment and reduced consumer spending have clearly had a negative impact on the united states economy 
retailers responded to the general sense of economic uncertainty by delaying the placement of orders  reducing orders  aggressive price discounting and aggressive promotional activities 
many retailers  including some of perry ellis customers  have prioritized their own private label products or have instituted competitive internet based global bidding processes for their private label business that  in some cases  are designed to effectively reduce margins to a level that are no longer attractive to perry ellis 
in addition  during the past several years various retailers  including customers of perry ellis  have experienced significant difficulties including bankruptcies  liquidations and reorganizations 
all of these factors have materially adversely affected the apparel industry 
furthermore  the geopolitical situation has and may continue to adversely affect the us economy and consequently the apparel industry 
perry ellis believes that these negative conditions will continue for the foreseeable future and it expects to closely monitor the situation

the maximum number of shares of perry ellis common stock  however  that may be issued in the merger is limited to  perry ellis expects the transactions costs and related change of control and severance provisions to be approximately million 
the merger is subject to customary closing conditions 
perry ellis expects to close the merger before the end of its second fiscal quarter if all of the conditions to the merger are satisfied 
the cash portion of the merger consideration will be funded from perry ellis existing cash reserves and through borrowings under its senior credit facility

raphael  sales under license agreements for use of the jnco and ocean pacific brands  as well as  several private label programs

 consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
fin no 

fin no 
addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities formerly special purpose entities or spes 
in general  a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investor s that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
the objective of fin no 
is not to restrict the use of variable interest entities but to improve financial reporting by companies involved with variable interest entities 
fin no 
requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
perry ellis is required to adopt the provisions of fin no 
immediately for variable interests in variable interest entities created after january   and in the quarter ending april  for variable interests in variable interest entities created before february  however  certain of the disclosure requirements apply to financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established 
perry ellis does not have any variable interest entities as defined in fin no 
accordingly  the company has determined that it is not reasonable possible that it will be required to consolidate or disclose information about a variable interest entity upon the adoption of fin no 
critical accounting policies several of perry ellis accounting policies involve significant judgments and uncertainties 
the policies with the greatest effect on perry ellis results of operation and financial position include the estimated collectability of accounts receivable  the recoverability of obsolete or overstocked inventory and the impairment of long lived assets including trademarks 
revenue recognition 
sales are recognized at the time legal title to the product passes to the customer  generally fob perry ellis distribution facilities  net of trade allowances and a provision for estimated returns and other allowances 
royalty income is recognized when earned on the basis of the terms specified in the underlying contractual agreements 
perry ellis believes that its revenue recognition policies conform to staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
accounts receivable 
perry ellis maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts receivables for estimated trade discounts  co op advertising  allowances provided to retail customers to flow goods through the retail channel  and losses resulting from the inability of its retail customers to make required payments considering historical and anticipated trends 
judgment is critical because some retail customers are currently operating in bankruptcy or have experienced financial difficulties 
additional allowances might be required if their financial condition were to worsen 
inventories 
perry ellis inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market value 
perry ellis evaluates all of its inventory style size color stock keeping units or skus to determine excess or slow moving skus based on orders on hand and projections of future demand and market conditions 
for those units in inventory that are so identified  perry ellis estimates their market value or net sales value based on current realization trends 
if the projected net sales value is less than cost  on an individual sku basis  perry ellis provides an allowance to reflect the lower value of that inventory 
this methodology recognizes projected inventory losses at the time such losses are evident rather than at the time goods are actually sold 
intangible assets 
perry ellis reviews its intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for possible impairment on an annual basis in accordance with sfas no 
similarly  perry ellis continues to evaluate its under performing brands and business units 
assumptions and estimates used in the evaluation of impairment may affect the carrying value of long lived assets  which could result in impairment charges in future periods 
if perry ellis incorrectly anticipates these trends or unexpected events occur  perry ellis results of operations could be materially affected 
management reviews intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if there is an indication of impairment  management prepares an estimate of future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if these cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized to reduce the asset to its estimated fair value 
preparation of estimated expected future cash flows is inherently subjective and is based on management s best estimate of assumptions concerning future conditions 
items affecting comparability of fiscal period adoption of sfas no
