item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our primary business is the manufacturing and marketing of plastic films for use in the packaging  transportation  beverage  food  automotive  pharmaceutical  chemical  electronics  construction  agricultural and textile industries 
we currently have manufacturing operations located in nine countries in north america  europe  and the asia pacific region 
we manufacture plastic films principally from resins blended with other raw materials 
we may either sell the film or further process it by metallizing  printing  laminating  slitting or converting it 
our processing technologies enable us to create a variety of value added products according to the specifications of our customers 
resin costs generally average between and of the cost of goods sold 
since resin costs typically fluctuate  selling prices are generally determined as a spread over resin costs  usually expressed as cents per pound 
accordingly  costs and profits are most often expressed in cents per pound  and  with certain exceptions  the historical increases and decreases in resin costs have generally been reflected over a period of time in the sales prices of the products on a penny for penny basis 
assuming a constant volume of sales  an increase in resin costs should  therefore  result in increased sales revenues but lower gross profit as a percentage of sales or gross profit margin  while a decrease in resin costs should result in lower sales revenues with higher gross profit margins 
during fiscal  as a result of frequent increases in resin prices  customer resistance and competitive pressure  we were not able to pass on a large part of these increases  and this adversely affected our revenue  gross profit and earnings 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to pass on resin price increases on a penny for penny basis in the future 
results of operations year ended october   as compared to year ended october  net sales for the year ended october   increased by million  or  to million from million for the year ended october  net sales in north america decreased to million in fiscal from million during fiscal the decline resulted from an overall decrease in raw materials cost as compared to the prior fiscal year  resulting in a decrease in per unit selling prices partially offset by a increase in sales volume 
net sales in europe decreased million or to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in average selling prices and decrease in sales volume as a result of the competitive market place in the region 
net sales in asia pacific increased to million during fiscal from million for fiscal  primarily due to the acquisition of the visypak film and laminating businesses located in new zealand and australia  which increased sales volume by and average selling prices by 
gross profit for the year ended october   was million compared to million for the year ended october  gross profit in north america decreased million or to million for the year ended october  although average raw materials cost per unit was below those incurred in the prior year  resin costs increased substantially during the last four months of fiscal reductions in per unit manufacturing costs resulting from the company s cost containment efforts combined with the effects of increases in volume were insufficient to fully offset the company s inability to pass though these increased resin costs to our customers in the highly competitive market place 
gross profit in europe decreased to million for the year ended october   primarily due to the continuing general economic pressures of the region and the competitive marketplace  which resulted in lower average selling prices 
during the same period in fiscal  the european region incurred additional costs of million relating to its shutdown of the uk manufacturing facility and set up costs on the transfer of the uk manufacturing equipment to spain 
asia pacific gross profit for fiscal  increased by to million  as a result of the acquisition of the visypak film and laminates businesses  which increased sales volume of higher gross margin products in the region  which offset lower average per unit selling prices of other products 
the general economic pressures and highly competitive marketplace in the region negatively effected the asia pacific margins 
gross profit for fiscal included million of restructuring charges recorded for the shut down of the melbourne  australia facility 
operating expenses for the year ended october   were million  an increase of million or from million for the year ended october  delivery expenses increased to million in the current period from million in the prior fiscal year  primarily due to the increase in worldwide sales volume  which increased our third party delivery costs 
selling and general and administrative expenses increased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase can be primarily attributed to the visypak acquisition and commissions paid on the increased sales volume sold during the year offset by a decrease of million of goodwill amortization from fiscal effective november   the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
and therefore ceased the amortization of its goodwill 
interest expense for the year ended october   was million compared to million for the prior year 
the decrease in interest expense resulted from lower average interest rates paid during the current period partially offset by higher average debt outstanding for the period 
on november   the company acquired all of the shares of the new zealand and australian flexible packaging businesses of visypak operations pty limited visypak for approximately million us dollars 
immediately following the acquisition  the company combined its liquipac bag in box business with the liquibag systems business it had acquired from visypak and sold of the new company to ds smith uk limited  a wholly owned subsidiary of ds smith  plc  for million  resulting in a gain of million 
other income expense  net for the year ended october   amounted to a million expense versus other income of million for fiscal this amount included foreign currency transaction losses of million realized during the current period versus gains of  in the prior year 
the company also had gains on sales of building and equipment of  versus million in the prior year  which included a million gain on the sale of its former new jersey operating facility  and other miscellaneous income and expenses results of operations year ended october   as compared to year ended october  net sales for the year ended october   decreased by million or to million from million in the prior fiscal year 
net sales in north america decreased to million during fiscal from million in fiscal  or  primarily due to a decrease in sales volume in addition to a decrease in per unit selling prices as a result of lower raw material costs  primarily resin  which were partially passed through to customers 
net sales in europe decreased to million for fiscal from million in fiscal  or  primarily due to a decrease in average selling prices in addition to a decrease in sales volume of because of the continuing economic pressures of the region 
net sales in asia pacific decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  or  primarily due to decreases of in average selling prices and in sales volume  which resulted from the economic pressures of the region

gross profit in europe decreased to million for fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in average selling prices of in addition to a reduction in sales volume of  both of which resulted from the continuing economic pressures of the region 
the european businesses also incurred additional costs of million in both fiscal and associated with the shutdown of our north baddesley  england  facilities and costs associated with the transfer of the manufacturing equipment from the uk to spain 
asia pacific gross profit for fiscal decreased by million  or  as a result of a decrease in average per unit selling prices and a decrease in volume due to the competitive and economic pressures of the region 
gross profit was further reduced by million for fiscal for the restructuring charges recorded for the shut down of the melbourne  australia  facility 
operating expenses for the year ended october  decreased million  or  to million from million in fiscal delivery expenses decreased million  primarily due to a decrease in average third party delivery costs in north america and the reduction in worldwide sales volume of in fiscal versus fiscal selling and general and administrative expenses decreased by approximately  with no significant increases or decreases in any one area 
interest expense for the year ended october   was million compared to million for the year ended october  this decrease in interest expense resulted from lower average debt outstanding for the period combined with lower average interest rates paid during the current period 
other income expense for fiscal amounted to million 
this amount included foreign currency exchange gains realized during the period  gains on sales of property  plant and equipment and interest income 
in april  the company sold its one half interest in hitachi filtec joint venture for million  which resulted in a loss of million after all fees and investment costs 
net loss from continuing operations for fiscal  was million compared to net loss from continuing operations of million for fiscal this additional loss was primarily due to the decrease in average selling prices and sales volume for the fiscal year 
the company also incurred additional restructuring charges of million for the close down of its manufacturing facilities in england and million of restructuring charges for the closedown of its melbourne  australia  plant 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations through cash flow generated from operations and borrowings by us and our subsidiaries under various credit facilities 
our principal uses of cash have been to fund working capital  including operating expenses  debt service and capital expenditures 
our working capital amounted to million at october   compared to million at october  this million increase in working capital is primarily the result of our acquisition of visypak in asia pacific  which increased net working capital  and an increase of million in current assets representing the net book value of our property which is held for sale in the united kingdom 
such sale is expected to close during the first six months of fiscal these increases were offset by increased short term borrowings of our foreign subsidiaries due to the weakening of the united states dollar during the year ended october  the remaining increases and decreases in components of our financial position reflect normal operating activity 
on november   we entered into a loan and security agreement with congress financial corporation  as agent  and the financial institutions named in the agreement  as lenders 
under this new credit facility the lenders provided a maximum credit facility of million  including a letter of credit facility of up to million 
amounts available for borrowing are based upon the sum of eligible domestic values of buildings and equipment at the closing date and eligible accounts receivable and inventories on a monthly basis 
the new credit facility is secured by mortgages and liens on our domestic assets and on of our equity ownership in certain foreign subsidiaries 
the agreement contains customary covenants  including limitations on the incurrence of debt  the disposition of assets  the making of restricted payments  and minimum ebitda requirements if the loan s excess availability is less than million 
at the closing  we borrowed the sum of million  of which million was used to pay off and terminate the existing term loan and revolving credit facility 
rates under the new facility are comparable to those under the prior facility 
as of october   there was million outstanding under this credit facility with additional availability of million 
this credit facility expires in november and is expected to be refinanced at that time 
we maintain various unsecured short term credit facilities at our foreign subsidiaries 
at october   the aggregate amount outstanding under such facilities was million  and million was available for borrowing 
borrowings with these facilities are used to support operations at such subsidiaries and are generally serviced by local cash flow from operations 
our cash and cash equivalents were million at october   as compared to million at october  net cash provided in operating activities during the fiscal year ended october   was million  primarily due to depreciation and amortization of million  decreases in other current and long term assets of million and an increase in accounts payable of million offset by a net loss for the period of million  increases in accounts receivable and inventories net of provision for losses of million  in deferred tax assets of million  the net gain of million on the sale of a business  and reductions in accrued expenses and long term liabilities of million 
in each period  the net decreases in other operating assets and liabilities reflect normal operating activity 
net cash used in investing activities during the twelve months ended october   was million  resulting primarily from the acquisition of the visypak business for million and investment in capital expenditures of million offset by the sales of interest in subsidiary  which resulted in net proceeds of million and sales of equipment for approximately  net cash provided by financing activities during the fiscal  was million  reflecting net borrowings of million under available credit facilities and proceeds from stock issuances of  the remaining increases and decreases in the components of our financial position reflect normal operating activity 
the company s aggregate commitments under its loan agreement  senior subordinated debentures  foreign borrowings and noncancelable operating lease agreements as of october  are as follows for the fiscal years ending october  borrowings operating leases total commitment amounts in thousands thereafter    the company expects to refinance this debt during fiscal year the company knows of no current or pending demands or commitments that will materially affect its liquidity 
the company s has approximately million of unfunded pension benefit obligations for its foreign locations at october  we believe that our cash flow from operations  combined with the availability of funds under the new credit facility and credit lines available to our foreign subsidiaries for local currency borrowings will be sufficient to meet our working capital  capital expenditure and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future 
effects of inflation inflation is not expected to have significant impact on our business 
contingencies the company s holland subsidiary has been served by the european commission with a notice to produce various documents and other evidence relating to its investigation of a possible violation of european competition law by the subsidiary 
the company is cooperating with the european commission in its investigation 
at this time  no litigation is pending against the company involving this matter and the company is not in a position to evaluate the outcome of this investigation 
however  there can be no assurance that  in the event the european commission serves a statement of objections instituting a proceeding against the company s holland subsidiary which results in a fine being assessed  that the amount of the fine would not be material 
recently issued statements of financial accounting standards in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 

sfas no 
requires the company to record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which it incurs a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets that result from acquisitions  construction  development and or normal use of assets 
the company also records a corresponding asset  which is depreciated over the life of the asset 
subsequent to the initial measurement of the asset retirement obligation  the obligation will be adjusted at the end of each period to reflect the passage of time and changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the obligation 
the company adopted sfas no 
on november  the company does not expect that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement requires that long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
sfas no 
requires companies to separately report discontinued operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of by sale  abandonment  or in a distribution to owners or is classified as held for sale 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
the company adopted sfas no 
on november  the company does not expect the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas and nullifies eitf issue no 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred  whereas eitf no 
had recognized the liability at the commitment date to an exit plan 
the company is required to adopt the provisions of sfas effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the company does not expect that the adoption of sfas will have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
it also amends the disclosure provisions of sfas to require prominent disclosures about the effects on reported net income of an entity s accounting policy decisions with respect to stock based employee compensation 
sfas also amends apb opinion no 
 interim financial reporting  to require disclosures about those effects in interim financial information 
the amendments to sfas in paragraphs a e of the statement shall be effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  the amendment to sfas in paragraph f of this statement and the amendment to opinion in paragraph shall be effective for financial reports containing condensed financial statements for interim periods beginning after december  the company currently accounts for its stock based compensation awards to employees and directors under the accounting prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
and provides the disclosures required by sfas no 
the company believes that it will continue to account for its stock based compensation awards to employees and directors under the accounting prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
and will adopt the additional disclosure provisions of sfas during the first quarter of its fiscal year ending october  critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to customer incentives  product returns  doubtful accounts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations  retirement benefits  and contingencies and litigation 
management bases its estimates and judgements on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgements and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition  including customer rebates  promotions and other incentive programs estimating valuation allowances and accrued liabilities  specifically the allowance for doubtful accounts  reserves for obsolete or potentially obsolete inventories  lifo valuations and litigation accruals accounting for income taxes and estimating the realizability of deferred tax assets derivative instruments cash flow hedges purchase accounting and valuation of investment in joint venture impairment of long lived assets the company recognizes sales and cost of sales at the time the product is shipped to the customer and records estimated reductions to revenue for customer rebates  promotions or other incentive programs 
if market conditions were to decline  the company may take actions to increase customer incentive programs  thus resulting in a reduction of gross sales and profit at the time the incentive is offered 
management estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing accounts receivable balances by age  applying historical trend rates to the most recent months sales  less account write offs to date 
when it is deemed probable that a customer account is uncollectable  that balance is added to the calculated reserve 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions 
management reviews its physical inventories at each business unit to determine the obsolescence of the products on hand 
when the company determines it has some obsolete inventory  our north america operations scrap those inventory items and our international operations establish the appropriate reserve for these items 
the company maintains its united states inventory on the lifo method of inventory valuation  except for supplies 
the lifo valuation is reviewed quarterly for net realizable value and adjusted accordingly 
management s current estimated ranges of liabilities related to pending litigation are based on management s best estimate of future costs 
final resolution of the litigation contingencies could result in amounts different from current accruals and  therefore  have an impact on the company s consolidated financial results in a future reporting period 
the company is involved in routine litigation in the normal course of its business and these proceedings are not expected to have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
management accounts for income taxes in accordance sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 

under sfas no 
 an asset and liability approach is required 
such approach results in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the book carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
as part of the process of preparing the company s consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
this process involves estimating actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the realizability of the company s deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on the future taxable income of the entity to which the deferred tax asset relates 
management assesses the likelihood that such deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent management believes that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
should the future taxable income of such entities be materially different from management s estimates an additional valuation allowance may be necessary in future periods 
such future amounts  if necessary  could be material to our results of operations and financial position 
the company operates internationally  giving rise to exposure to market risks from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
derivative financial instruments are utilized by the company to reduce these risks 
the company has established policies and procedures for risk assessment and the approval  reporting and monitoring of derivative financial instrument activities 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
the company primarily enters into forward exchange contracts with terms that mirror the existing intercompany loans  which give rise to the foreign currency risk 
these derivatives do not qualify as hedges and gains and losses are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
in addition  the company hedges third party commitments with cash flow hedges 
at the inception of the hedge the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge and appropriate documentation is prepared 
on an on going basis the company assesses hedge effectiveness for all designated hedges in order to determine that each derivative continues to be effective 
the acquisition of visypak in november was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and  accordingly  the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based upon the estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition 
we formed a new zealand company  rapak asia pacific ltd 
rapak and sold of the venture to ds smith as part of a joint venture agreement for the operation of rapak 
rapak acquired the bag in box business conducted by visy in new zealand and australia  and we transferred our new zealand liquipac business to rapak 
since the company does not have an effective controlling voting interest in this venture  it has accounted for its investment under the equity method of accounting 
the company records its equity in the income or losses of this investee based upon the best information available as of the date of the financial statements 
adjustments  if any  to these amounts are made in the period that such information becomes available 
prior to november   long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles held and used by the company were reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered under the provisions of sfas no 
assets to be disposed of were reported at the lower of the carrying value or the fair market value less costs to sell 
on november   the company elected to adopt the provisions of sfas no 
as required by sfas no 
 the company performed an assessment of whether there was an indication that goodwill was impaired at the date of adoption 
in connection therewith  the company determined that its operations represented one reporting unit and determined the reporting unit s fair value and compared it to the reporting unit s book value 
as of november   the company s reporting unit s fair value exceeded its carrying amounts 
accordingly  the company was not required to perform any further transitional impairment tests 
as of september   the company updated its test concluding that there were no indications of impairment 
the company plans to perform its impairment test each september in the future 
the company continued to review its other long lived assets  primarily property  plant and equipment  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
through october  forward looking statements management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and the results of operations and other sections of this report contain forward looking statements about prospects for the future  such as our ability to generate sufficient working capital  our ability to continue to maintain sales and profits of our operations and our ability to generate sufficient funds to meet our cash requirements 
we wish to caution readers that the assumptions which form the basis for forward looking statements with respect to  or that may impact earnings for the year ending october   include many factors that are beyond our ability to control or estimate precisely 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  availability of raw materials  ability to pass raw material price increases to customers in a timely fashion  the potential of technological changes which would adversely affect the need for our products  price fluctuations which could adversely impact our inventory  and changes in united states or international economic or political conditions  such as inflation or fluctuations in interest or foreign exchange rates 
parties are cautioned not to rely on any such forward looking statements or judgments in this section and in other parts of this report 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  which may adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition 
the company seeks to minimize these risks through operating and financing activities and  when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
the company does not purchase  hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rates the company may use interest rate swaps  collars and options to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
at october   the company was not a party to any interest rate swaps  collars or options 
the fair value of the company s fixed interest rate debt varies with changes in interest rates 
generally  the fair value of fixed rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
at october   the carrying value of the company s total debt was million of which approximately million was fixed rate debt 
as of october   the estimated fair value of the company s fixed rate debt  which includes the cost of replacing the company s fixed rate debt with borrowings at current market rates  was approximately million foreign exchange the company enters into derivative financial instruments principally foreign exchange forward contracts against the euro  canadian dollar  australian dollar and new zealand dollar primarily to hedge intercompany transactions and trade sales and purchases 
foreign currency forward contracts reduce the company s exposure to the risk that the eventual cash inflows and outflows  resulting from these intercompany and third party trade transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency  will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates 
as of october   the company had foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding with a notional contract amount of million  all of which have a maturity of less than one year 
at october   the net fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges by the company was a loss of  which is included in accrued expenses  and at october   the fair value of derivative financial instruments held by the company was a gain of  which was recognized for the period in other current assets and was also reflected in shareholders equity as a component of other comprehensive income 
the company s foreign subsidiaries had third party outstanding debt of approximately million and million on october  and  respectively 
such debt is generally denominated in the functional currency of the borrowing subsidiary 
the company believes that this enables it to better match operating cash flows with debt service requirements and to better match foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  thereby reducing its need to enter into foreign exchange contracts 
commodities the company uses commodity raw materials  primarily resin  and energy products in conjunction with its manufacturing process 
generally  the company acquires such components at market prices and does not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices 
as a result  the company is exposed to market risks related to changes in commodity prices in connection with these components 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties we describe below and the other information in this annual report or incorporated by reference before deciding to invest in  or retain  shares of our common stock 
these are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face 
additional risks and uncertainties that we do not currently know about or that we currently believe are immaterial  or that we have not predicted  may also harm our business operations or adversely affect us 
if any of these risks or uncertainties actually occurs  our business  financial condition or operating results could be materially harmed 
industry risks our business is dependent on the availability of raw materials and our ability to pass on price increases to our customers our ability to maintain profitability is heavily dependent upon our ability to pass through to our customers the full amount of any increase in raw material costs 
the principal raw materials that we use in our products are polyethylene  polypropylene and polyvinyl chloride resins 
our ability to operate profitably is dependent  in large part  on the market for these resins 
the supply and demand for these resins and the petro chemical intermediates from which they are produced are subject to substantial price fluctuations and market disturbances  including occasional shortages of supply 
prices fluctuate as a result of changes in natural gas and oil prices and the capacity of the companies that produce these products 
if there is overcapacity in the production of any specific product that we manufacture and sell  we frequently are not able to pass through the full amount of any cost increase 
if resin prices increase and we are not able to fully pass on the increases to our customers  our profits and our financial condition will be adversely affected 
intense competition in the flexible packaging markets may adversely affect our operating results the business of supplying plastic packaging products is extremely competitive 
we believe that there are few barriers to entry into many of our markets 
as a result  we have experienced  and may continue to experience  competition resulting from new manufacturers of various types of film in our product line 
also  when new manufacturers enter the market for a product or existing manufacturers increase capacity  they frequently reduce prices to achieve increased market share 
companies can also develop products that have superior performance characteristics to our products 
any of these actions by our competitors can adversely affect our sales 
in addition  we face competition from a substantial number of companies  which sell similar and substitute packaging products 
some of these competitors are subsidiaries or divisions of large international diversified companies with extensive production facilities  well developed sales and marketing staffs and substantial financial resources 
competitive products are also available from a number of local manufacturers 
this results in competition which is highly price sensitive 
we also compete on the basis of quality  service  timely delivery and differentiation of product properties 
an increase in competition could result in material selling price reductions or loss of our market share 
this could materially adversely affect our operations and financial condition 
we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations which govern our operations and which may result in potential liability our operations are subject to various federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations which govern discharges into the air and water  the storage  handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste  the remediation of soil and ground water contaminated by petroleum products or hazardous substances or waste  and the health and safety of our employees 
future compliance with these laws and regulations may require material expenditures by us 
in addition  the nature of our current and former operations and the history of industrial uses at some of our manufacturing facilities expose us to the risk of liabilities or claims with respect to environmental and worker health and safety matters 
we may also be exposed to claims for violations of environmental laws and regulations by previous owners or operators of our property 
in addition  the presence of  or failure to remediate  hazardous substances or waste may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent any property or to use it as collateral for a loan 
we also may be liable for costs relating to the investigation  remediation or removal of hazardous waste and substances from a disposal or treatment facility to which we or our predecessors sent waste or materials 
company risks we experience fluctuations in operating results  which may cause our stock price to fluctuate our operating results have been subject to significant quarterly and annual fluctuations 
these fluctuations can be caused by global economic conditions  competition  variability in raw material prices  acquisitions  asset sales  business restructuring initiatives  seasonality  and foreign currency fluctuations these fluctuations make it more difficult for investors to compare our operating results to corresponding prior year periods 
these fluctuations may also cause our stock price to fluctuate 
you should not rely on our results of operations for any particular quarter or year as indicative of our results for a full year or any other quarter 
because we have limited contractual relationships with our customers  our customers may unilaterally reduce the purchase of our products we generally do not enter into long term contractual relationships with our customers 
as a result  our customers may unilaterally reduce the purchase of our products or  in certain cases  terminate existing orders for which we may have incurred significant production costs 
our business may be adversely affected by risks associated with foreign operations approximately of our revenues are generated from operations conducted outside north america 
conducting an international business inherently involves a number of difficulties and risks  including the following currency fluctuations  inflation  export restrictions  compliance with existing and changing regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  difficulties in shifting production between different facilities  longer payment cycles  problems in collecting accounts receivable  political instability and economic downturns  seasonal reductions in business activity in europe during the summer months  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
we have experienced and may continue to experience any or all of these risks 
any of these factors may materially adversely affect our sales  profits  cash flow and financial position  which could adversely affect our stock price 
we may  from time to time  experience problems in our labor relations of our employees in north america  unions represent employees under three collective bargaining agreements 
these agreements expire in march and in february and march further  we have collective bargaining agreements at our international facilities  covering substantially all of the hourly employees at these facilities 
changes in these agreements  over which we have no control  could adversely affect us 
our business may be adversely affected by results of ongoing health and safety studies on plastics and resins continuing studies of the potential effect on health and safety of various resins and plastics  including polyvinyl chlorides  are being conducted by industry groups  government agencies and others 
the results of these studies  along with the development of any other new information  may adversely affect our ability to market and sell certain of our products or may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured by such products  any of which could adversely affect our profits and financial condition 
anti takeover and change of control provisions may adversely affect our stockholders our directors are elected for three year terms  so approximately one third of the board is elected each year 
we are subject to a delaware statute regulating business combinations 
these factors could discourage  hinder or preclude an unsolicited acquisition of our company and could make it less likely that stockholders receive a premium for their shares as a result of any such attempt 
in addition  our board of directors may issue  without stockholder approval  shares of preferred stock 
the preferred stock could have voting  liquidation  dividend or other rights superior to those of the common stock 
therefore  if we issue preferred stock  your rights as a common stockholder may be adversely affected 
in connection with our senior subordinated notes offering  we entered into an indenture which requires us  upon a change of control  to offer to purchase the outstanding senior subordinated notes 
if a change of control were to occur and we could not obtain a waiver or if we do not have the funds to make the purchase  we would be in default under the senior subordinated notes  which could depress our stock price 
possible violation of european competition law could adversely affect us the european commission has served our holland subsidiary with a notice to produce various documents and other evidence relating to its investigation of a possible violation of european competition law by that subsidiary 
we are cooperating in this investigation 
no litigation has been instituted against us involving this matter 
however  we are not in a position to evaluate the outcome of the investigation 
if the litigation is instituted  a fine may be assessed 
we are not in a position to predict whether litigation will be commenced and  if commenced  and our subsidiary is found guilty  that the fine would not be material 
financial risks we have a high level of debt relative to our equity  which reduces cash available for our business  may adversely affect our ability to obtain additional funds and increases our vulnerability to economic or business downturns we are highly leveraged and our operations are subject to restrictions imposed by the terms of our indebtedness 
as of october   our total consolidated indebtedness  including short term borrowings  was approximately million and our total shareholders equity was approximately million 
total indebtedness represented of the total capitalization 
accordingly  we are subject to all of the risks associated with substantial indebtedness  including a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations will be used to service our indebtedness  we will have reduced funds available for operations  future business opportunities and other purposes  our ability to obtain additional financing for acquisitions  working capital  capital 
expenditures  general corporate or other purposes may be impaired  we are more vulnerable to economic downturns and less able to withstand competitive pressures and react to changes in our industry and general economic conditions 
the parent company to some extent finances its foreign subsidiaries 
as these inter company loans increase  our exposure to currency flucuations and costs associated with these loans increases 
in addition  the indenture under which our million outstanding senior subordinated notes were issued and the loan and security agreement under which a major portion of our other borrowings were made contain covenants which may limit our operating flexibility with respect to certain business matters 
if we fail to meet our scheduled debt service requirements  we will need to refinance our indebtedness or sell material assets  and if we fail to do so  a substantial portion of our assets can be sold by the lender under the loan and security agreement 
if we are unable to meet our future debt service requirements from our cash flow  we will be required to adopt one or more alternatives such as refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness  selling material assets or operations or seeking to raise additional debt or equity capital 
there can be no assurance that any of these actions could be taken on a timely basis or on satisfactory terms or that we will be able to satisfy our additional capital requirements 
in addition  the terms of the indenture and the loan and security agreement may prohibit us from adopting any of one or more of the alternatives which might otherwise be available 
our borrowings under the loan and security agreement are secured by mortgages and liens on our domestic assets and on of our ownership interest in certain foreign subsidiaries 
accordingly if a default occurs under the loan and security agreement and is not cured  it may result in a substantial reduction or termination of our business 
further  such default would also constitute a default under the indenture pursuant to which our senior subordinated notes were issued
