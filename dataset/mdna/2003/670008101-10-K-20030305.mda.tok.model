table of contents part i item business novellus systems  inc  a california corporation organized in  develops  manufactures  sells and supports systems used in the fabrication of integrated circuits 
the customers for these products are manufacturers of semiconductor integrated circuits  or chips  who either incorporate the chips they manufacture in their own products or sell them to other companies for use in electronic products 
integrated circuits are generally built on a silicon wafer base and include a large number of different components  such as transistors  capacitors and other electronic devices that are connected by multiple layers of wiring or interconnects 
to build an integrated circuit  transistors are first created on the surface of the silicon wafer 
the wiring and insulating structures are then added as multiple thin film layers through a series of processes 
typically  a first layer of dielectric  or insulating material is deposited on top of the formed transistors 
that layer is then etched to create patterns that are subsequently filled with conductive metal traditionally aluminum  but increasingly  copper is used 
in copper dual damascene  a chemical mechanical planarization  or polishing  step follows to remove excess copper 
the sequence is then repeated to create the multiple layers of wiring needed to connect the transistors and form the integrated circuit 
advanced chip designs require as many as steps involving these and other manufacturing processes 
novellus operates in a single industry segment for the manufacture  marketing and support of semiconductor fabrication equipment 
our product offerings are centered on the advanced systems used to deposit the films of conducting and insulating material  using chemical vapor deposition cvd  physical vapor deposition pvd and electroplating or electrofill tm  commonly known in the industry as electrochemical deposition ecd processes  to form the layers of wiring and insulation  known as the interconnect  in semiconductor devices 
our high density plasma cvd hdp and plasma enhanced cvd pecvd systems employ a chemical plasma to deposit all of the dielectric or insulating layers and some of the metal or conductive layers on the surface of a semiconductor wafer 
our pvd systems use direct current power to deposit conductive metal layers by sputtering metallic atoms from the surface of a target source 
our electrofill systems are used for depositing conductive layers of copper on wafers in an electroplating or damascene process 
building on our historical strength in deposition technologies  in we expanded into the area of wafer surface preparation by acquiring gasonics international corporation  a manufacturer of systems used to clean and prepare a wafer surface after the manufacturing steps that precede deposition 
more recently  in december we completed the acquisition of speedfam ipec  inc  a manufacturer of chemical mechanical planarization cmp products 
as the semiconductor industry migrates to the use of copper and low k low capacitance dielectrics in semiconductors  the manufacturing steps for surface preparation and cmp are becoming increasingly important

industry background over the past twenty years  the semiconductor industry has grown rapidly as a result of increasing demand for personal computers  the expansion of the internet and the telecommunications industry  and the emergence of new applications in consumer electronics 
more recently  growth has slowed  and there are signs that the industry may be beginning to mature 
while unit demand for semiconductor devices continues to rise  the average selling prices are declining 
there is increasing pressure on chipmakers to reduce manufacturing costs while increasing the value of their products at the same time 
the semiconductor industry has also been cyclical in nature over its history  with periods of rapid expansion followed by periods of over capacity 
several technological trends characterize semiconductor manufacturing 
perhaps the most prominent of these trends is increasing density 
moore s law  first postulated in the mid s and still accurate almost years later  states that the density of circuitry on an individual semiconductor chip doubles every months 
today s advanced devices are being manufactured with line widths as small as micron and with up to eight layers of interconnect circuitry 
by increasing circuit density  manufacturers can pack more electronic components on a chip and thereby provide higher performance and value 
the next generation of chips will likely see line widths as small as nanometer micron and below  requiring even more sophisticated interconnect wiring to keep pace 

table of contents another trend worth noting is the transition to copper wiring in place of aluminum as the primary conductive material in semiconductor devices 
copper has a lower electrical resistance value than aluminum  and this provides a number of performance advantages 
because of the superior properties of copper  a chip made with copper may need only half as many metal layers as one made with aluminum 
this provides a significant reduction in manufacturing cost 
in addition  copper wiring produces a significant improvement in device performance and a significant reduction in power requirements as compared to aluminum 
a similar transition is underway to low k dielectric insulators  which are replacing traditional silicon oxide films 
low k dielectrics are better at limiting the capacitance that occurs between metal lines in a device 
this quality is important to the goal of smaller line widths and increasing component density 
however  low k materials are also less stable than silicon oxide  and this poses a host of new challenges to the semiconductor industry in pursuing its goals of increased circuit density and  at the same time  lower cost of manufacture and higher performance and value of the manufactured product 
another important trend is the move to larger wafer sizes 
chipmakers are migrating to larger  mm wafers because of the potential manufacturing cost advantages these larger wafers provide through the production of more integrated circuits on each individual wafer compared to the mm wafers that have been the industry standard for approximately the past ten years 
these trends shape the equipment and process demands that our customers place on us 
our customers generally measure the cost and performance of their production equipment in terms of cost per wafer  a ratio determined by factoring in the costs for acquisition and installation of a system  operating costs  and net throughput rate 
a system with higher net throughput allows a manufacturer to recover the purchase price over a greater number of wafers  thereby reducing the cost of ownership of the system on a per wafer basis 
yield and film qualities are also significant factors in selecting processing equipment 
the higher costs of larger and more complex semiconductor wafers have made high yields extremely important to our customers 
to achieve higher yields and better film quality  systems must be able to repeat a process consistently and reliably 
this characteristic  known as repeatability  is critical in achieving commercially acceptable yields 
systems that operate at desired throughput rates without approaching critical tolerance limits can achieve repeatability more easily 
strategy our business objective at novellus is to use our core expertise to increase our market share in the interconnect manufacturing arena and strengthen our position as a leading supplier of semiconductor processing equipment 
the following are the key elements of our strategy emphasize high productivity systems we established our current position in the industry by emphasizing high productivity as the principal benefit that our products and technologies deliver to customers 
our unique multi chamber system for continuous pecvd processing illustrates our commitment to productivity 
this multi chamber design enables our pecvd systems to attain very high levels of wafer throughput  yield and film quality 
the simple architecture of our systems also takes up less space in the fab and requires less downtime than other system designs 
we intend to retain our historical focus on productivity by applying our multi chamber and continuous processing architecture in product enhancements and new product offerings 
focus on reducing customer costs cost is an important component when measuring overall productivity 
to that end  we strive to provide products and technologies that reduce our customers overall cost of ownership 
we pursue these advantages by offering chipmakers a number of process improvements and process differentiators  as well as by providing highly reliable systems that require less servicing than competing alternatives in the market 
differentiate our service philosophy we do not view our customer service operations as a profit center and source of revenue generation 
our philosophy is to develop reliable products that do not break down as often or require as much servicing as competing alternatives 
in addition  we strive to provide support that minimizes the downtime and service costs that our customers experience 
lead in our target markets our goal is to command a leadership position in each of our target market areas 
historically  we have aimed to be the leader or the second or third largest provider in each of the subsets that comprise the served available market for our deposition products hdp  cvd  pecvd  pvd and ecd 
due to our acquisition of gasonics and subsequent internal product development efforts  we are one of the leading providers of surface preparation products 
our acquisition of speedfam ipec has enabled us to become one of the industry s top suppliers of cmp products 
we intend to aggressively pursue a leadership position in cmp similar to those we have achieved in other market segments 

table of contents broaden our interconnect offerings as semiconductor manufacturing technology becomes more complex  the interconnect structures on a chip take on a greater importance in the manufacturing process 
we believe that by expanding beyond our historical focus on deposition products we can add value in related interconnect manufacturing process steps 
the acquisitions of gasonics and speedfam ipec which enabled novellus to enter the surface preparation and cmp product arenas  respectively are examples of this strategy in action 
focus on major semiconductor manufacturers we have sold one or more systems to each of the world s top semiconductor manufacturing equipment capital spenders 
our sales objective is to work closely with our customers as they expand existing facilities  retrofit older manufacturing plants with new equipment  and build new fabrication facilities 
we strive to build customer loyalty and achieve a high level of repeat business by offering high reliability products  comprehensive field support  and a responsive parts replacement and service program 
expand market presence in asia while we derive a significant percentage of net sales from asia  we believe that substantial additional growth potential exists in the region over the long term 
japan  taiwan and korea continue to represent a disproportionate share of the world s capacity for semiconductor manufacturing  and china is rapidly becoming a major manufacturing region for the industry 
our local presence in asia includes sales and support offices throughout japan 
in addition  we maintain five offices in korea  three in china  two each in taiwan  malaysia and singapore  and one office in india 
we plan to continue our efforts to better serve this region 
leverage our low manufacturing cost structure we do all system design  assembly and testing in house  and outsource the manufacture of major subassemblies 
this strategy allows us to minimize our fixed costs and capital expenditures and gives us the flexibility to increase capacity as needed 
outsourcing also allows us to focus on product differentiation through system design and quality control and helps to ensure that our subsystems incorporate the latest third party technologies in robotics  gas panels and microcomputers 
we work closely with our suppliers to achieve mutual cost reduction through joint design projects 
products deposition products our historical strength is rooted in deposition products  where we have consistently maintained a leadership position in the industry 
we currently offer products that address the needs of manufacturers across a number of different deposition technologies cvd  pvd and ecd 
since the introduction of our concept one dielectric platform in  we have offered a range of processing systems for dielectric and metal deposition 
in  we introduced the concept two platform a modular  integrated production system capable of depositing both dielectric and conductive metal layers by combining one or more processing chambers with a common  automated wafer handler 
the concept two enables chipmakers to increase production throughput and system capability  as required in mm wafer manufacturing applications  by adding process modules without having to replace existing equipment 
in  we introduced the concept three platform  which builds on the foundation of its predecessor to offer greater throughput in mm wafer manufacturing applications 
hdp cvd products in the cvd process  manufacturers place wafers in a reaction chamber  introduce a variety of pure and precisely metered gases into the chamber  and then add some form of energy to activate a chemical reaction that deposits a film on the wafer 
the cvd process is the traditional method used to deposit dielectric insulating films on wafers 
manufacturers also use cvd to deposit conductive metal layers  particularly tungsten  as it is difficult to deposit such layers on devices with very small features using conventional pvd or other deposition technologies 
concept two speed introduced in  concept two speed was the semiconductor industry s first high density plasma system capable of high volume manufacturing  and today it is one of the top two leading systems in the hdp cvd marketplace 
concept two speed is a single wafer processing system for mm substrates 
it is targeted for depositing dielectric material in aluminum interconnect manufacturing processes  as well as for deposition of pre metal layers in copper manufacturing processes 

table of contents concept three speed the concept three speed is designed for applying dielectric material in mm wafer manufacturing processes 
because it is based on our production proven concept two products  concept three speed offers minimal risk to our customers in making the transition from mm to mm wafer size in their high volume integrated circuit manufacturing processes 
cvd products concept two altus in  we introduced the concept two altus  used to deposit the tungsten plugs and vias that connect aluminum interconnect lines in aluminum based chips 
the concept two altus combines the modular architecture of the concept two with an advanced tungsten cvd dual process chamber 
the system is ideal for meeting the requirements of high volume  automated mm wafer fabs producing semiconductor devices at micron and below 
concept three altus the concept three altus  introduced in  brings the same advantages to mm wafer tungsten deposition as our concept two altus predecessor provides for mm wafer applications 
pecvd products concept two sequel express introduced in  the concept two sequel express is designed to deposit our coral family of low k dielectric films  as well as other advanced films required for manufacturing micron and smaller semiconductor devices 
with a throughput in excess of wafers per hour  concept two sequel express delivers up to percent higher capital productivity and percent lower cost of ownership than competing pecvd systems 
vector introduced in  vector is a pecvd system for depositing dielectric films on mm wafers 
vector delivers a fully integrated low k dielectric structure at micron and smaller design rules 
with approximately two thirds the footprint of the nearest competitor  percent fewer critical subassemblies and a throughput of wafers per hour  vector delivers higher capital productivity than any other pecvd system currently on the market 
pvd products pvd  also known as sputtering  is a process where ions of an inert gas such as argon are electrically accelerated in a high vacuum toward a target of pure metal  such as tantalum or copper 
upon impact  the argon ions sputter off the target material  which is then deposited as a thin film on the silicon wafer 
pvd processes are used to create the barrier and seed layers in copper damascene interconnect applications 
we entered the pvd marketplace with the acquisition of varian associates thin film systems division in inova the inova mm system was introduced in with a multi chamber  single wafer processing design 
the hollow cathode magnetron or hcm ionized pvd source continues to gain market acceptance based on barrier seed step coverage performance 
inova xt in  we introduced the mm inova xt with hcm technology 
the product continues to offer superior barrier performance leading to low via resistance and improved device reliability 
electrofill products our electrofill products are used to produce the primary copper conductive layers in advanced integrated circuits 
electrofill uses copper to fill a structure created within the circuit s insulating layers  in a manufacturing process called copper damascene 
damascene manufacturing reverses the manufacturing process used with aluminum  where the metal is deposited first  then etched to create lines and vias  and finally filled with insulating layers between the metal lines 
our highly reliable and cost effective electrofill products employ liquid chemistries and electrolytic principles to deposit the copper wiring into the dielectric structure 

table of contents sabre the sabre copper electrofill system  introduced in  is one of the most reliable and technologically advanced copper ecd system available on the market 
sabre meets today s technology requirements for copper metal layers all the way down to nanometer micron line widths and beyond 
it employs a proprietary electrofilling cell that eliminates contamination of the back of the wafer with copper 
it features a unique plating cell design that improves the repeatability of the copper fill 
the simplicity of sabre s design is the key to the system s high reliability and manufacturing availability 
coupled with the inova pvd system  sabre provides a complete system for depositing advanced copper interconnects 
sabre xt the second generation sabre xt  introduced in  is the industry s leading ecd platform at both mm and mm wafer sizes 
new features on the xt that were not found on the original sabre include programmable electrical waveforms  advanced plating chemistries  an integrated anneal module and closed loop chemical monitoring 
surface preparation products photoresist strip and clean processes represent an area of semiconductor manufacturing that is becoming increasingly important with the industry s migration to copper interconnects 
chipmakers use surface preparation products to remove photoresist and other potential contaminants from a wafer before proceeding with the next deposition step in the manufacturing process 
we entered this application arena by acquiring gasonics in  and today we are one of the industry s leading suppliers of dry clean surface preparation products 
gamma the gamma mm photoresist removal system uses a plasma source to strip photoresist 
the gamma architecture features a multi station sequential processing design with six strip stations  resulting in high wafer throughput with a minimal number of critical subsystems 
gamma the gamma system is a front end of line feol photoresist strip system for mm wafers 
our multi station sequential processing architecture incorporates six stations within a single process chamber  enabling a percent higher throughput rate when compared to that of the closest competitor 
pep iridia the pep iridia is an advanced cleaning system designed for sub micron mm wafer applications 
the iridia s modular architecture allows manufacturers to configure the system for both front and back end of line cleaning applications down to nanometer device geometries 
targeted at critical steps in copper and low k manufacturing processes  the iridia offers the highest productivity of any mm dry clean system currently on the market 
sierra the sierra system is an advanced dry clean system for mm wafer manufacturing processes 
it delivers photoresist and residue removal for today s most advanced applications 
the sierra system is designed specifically to address the intricate cleaning challenges associated with the industry s migration to copper metallization and low k dielectrics 
it yields significantly higher capital productivity and significantly lower cost of ownership advantages than competing dry clean systems 
cmp products cmp systems polish the surface of a wafer after a deposition process to create a flat topography before moving on to subsequent manufacturing steps 
because copper is more difficult to polish and smooth than previous generation aluminum interconnects  and because low k dielectrics are much more porous than their predecessors  cmp has been elevated to the forefront of enabling technology required in a copper damascene manufacturing process 
in recognition of this trend  in  we completed the acquisition of speedfam ipec  a global supplier of cmp systems used in the fabrication of advanced copper interconnects 
we believe that the opportunity to integrate the planarization  deposition and surface preparation steps and optimize them for overall performance gives us an important advantage in extending copper low k processes to advanced semiconductor devices 
momentum momentum is a high throughput  dry in dry out cmp system for all mm wafer process applications 
designed with extendibility to accommodate future reductions in line widths  the momentum has four independent wafer polishing platens that allow for maximum manufacturing flexibility 
it also employs a patented orbital polishing motion that minimizes surface dishing and erosion and a slurry delivery system that results in more efficient consumption of polishing chemicals 
momentum our momentum is a highly flexible  dry in dry out cmp system that provides a transition for manufacturers moving from mm to mm wafer processing 
the system is unique in that it combines a number of advanced 
table of contents planarization and in line inspection technologies to produce highly effective throughput  yield management  superior process capabilities and low cost of ownership 
marketing  sales and service we market products worldwide to manufacturers of semiconductor devices 
in north america  we sell our products through a direct sales force that operates out of ten sales and support offices 
in europe  we sell our products predominantly through our sales and support facilities in france and scotland 
we also maintain sales and service support offices in the netherlands  germany  ireland and italy 
in asia  we sell our products directly in china  japan  korea  malaysia  singapore and taiwan 
our japanese operations  with headquarters near tokyo  include ten sales offices throughout japan 
the ability to provide prompt and effective field support is critical to our sales efforts  and we believe the support that we provide to our installed base has accelerated the penetration of certain key accounts 
we also believe that our marketing efforts are enhanced by the technical expertise of our research and development personnel  who provide customer process applications support and participate in a number of industry forums such as conferences and technical symposia 
equally significant  we believe that the design simplicity of our systems substantially enhances our ability to support our customers 
in  we became the first semiconductor equipment manufacturer to extend our warranty up to months from shipment  and in we began to include the cost of consumable parts on some systems and preventative maintenance parts under warranty 
we offer maintenance contracts as an additional service to customers 
for the year ended december   samsung electronics  intel corporation  taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company and international business machines corporation accounted for   and of our net sales  respectively 
for the year ended december   intel corporation accounted for of our net sales 
for the year ended december   intel corporation and taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company accounted for and of our net sales  respectively 
historically  we have sold a significant proportion of systems in any particular period to a limited number of customers 
sales to our ten largest customers in  and accounted for  and of our net sales  respectively 
we expect that sales of our products to relatively few customers none of which has entered into a long term agreement requiring it to purchase our products will continue to account for a high percentage of our net sales in the foreseeable future 
export sales including sales by our japanese subsidiary for the year ended december  were approximately million  or of net sales 
for the year ended december   export sales were million  or of net sales  while export sales for the year ended december  were approximately million  or of net sales 
backlog as of december   our backlog was million  with no cancellations in the period subsequent to december  to the date of this annual report on form k  compared to a backlog of million as of december   with approximately million of cancellations subsequent to december  our backlog includes only those customer orders for which we have accepted purchase orders and assigned shipment dates within twelve months 
all orders are subject to cancellation or rescheduling by customers  with limited or no penalties 
some products are shipped in the same quarter in which the order was received 
for this reason  and because of possible changes in delivery schedules  cancellations of orders and delays in shipments  our backlog as of any particular date is not necessarily a reliable indicator of actual sales for any succeeding period 
research and development the highly cyclical semiconductor manufacturing industry is subject to rapid technological change and continual new product introductions and enhancements 
our ability to remain competitive depends in large part on our success in developing new and enhanced systems and introducing them at competitive prices on a timely basis 
for this reason  we devote a significant portion of our personnel and financial resources to research and development programs 
our current research and development efforts are directed at the development of new systems and processes and the improvement of the capabilities of existing systems 
research and development programs include advanced pvd systems  advanced gap fill technology  primary conductor metals  low k dielectric materials  cmp systems  and additional advanced deposition and surface 
table of contents preparation technologies for the next generation of smaller geometry fabrication lines 
all new systems under development are capable of processing mm wafers 
expenditures for research and development during  and were million  million and million  respectively 
these investments represented approximately  and of our net sales in  and  respectively 
we believe that research and development expenditures will continue to represent a substantial percentage of our net sales in the future 
manufacturing our manufacturing activities consist primarily of assembling and testing components and subassemblies that we acquire from third party vendors and then integrate into a finished system 
we utilize an outsourcing strategy for the manufacture of major subassemblies  and we perform all system design  assembly and testing in house 
our outsourcing strategy enables us to minimize fixed costs and capital expenditures as well as provide the flexibility to increase production capacity 
this strategy also allows us to focus on product differentiation through system design and quality control 
we believe that our use of outsourced product specialists enables our subsystems to incorporate the latest and most advanced technologies in robotics  gas panels and microcomputers without the need for in house expertise 
we strive to work as closely as possible with all of our suppliers to achieve mutual cost reduction through joint design efforts 
although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that such parts are available from multiple suppliers  certain key parts may only be obtained from a single or limited source 
these suppliers are in some cases thinly capitalized  independent companies that generate significant portions of their business from us and or a small group of other companies in the semiconductor industry 
we seek to reduce our dependence on single or limited source suppliers 
however  disruptions in parts delivery or termination of certain of these suppliers may occur 
such disruptions and terminations could have an adverse effect on our operations 
a prolonged inability to obtain certain parts could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations  and could result in our inability to meet customer demands on time 
we manufacture our systems in clean room environments similar to those used by semiconductor manufacturers for wafer fabrication 
this helps to minimize the amount of particulates and other contaminants in the final assembled system  which in turn improves yields and reduces the level of contaminants for our customers 
following assembly  we package our completed systems in plastic shrink wraps to maintain clean room standards during shipment 
competition significant competitive factors in the semiconductor equipment market include system performance and flexibility  cost  the size of each manufacturer s installed customer base  customer support capability and the breadth of a company s product line 
we believe that we compete favorably in all of the market segments we serve because of the fundamental advantages associated with our system performance and flexibility  low cost of ownership  high wafer yields and customer support 
however  we face substantial competition from both established competitors and potential new entrants in each of these markets 
installing and integrating capital equipment into a semiconductor production line represents a substantial investment 
for this reason  once a manufacturer chooses a particular vendor s capital equipment  experience has shown that the manufacturer will generally rely upon that equipment for the useful life of the specific application 
as a result  all of today s semiconductor equipment makers typically have difficulty in selling a product to a particular customer to replace or substitute for a competitor s product previously chosen or qualified by that customer 
in the cvd  pecvd and pvd markets  our principal competitor is applied materials  inc  a major supplier of systems which has established a substantial base of installed equipment among today s leading semiconductor manufacturers 
in the ecd market  our principal competitors are semitool  which has a large base of installed equipment  and applied  which entered the market in our principal competitors in the surface preparation product arena are mattson technologies and axcelis technologies 
in the cmp market  which we entered at the end of  our major competitors are applied and ebara 
patents and proprietary rights we intend to continue to pursue the legal protection of our technology primarily through patent and trade secret protection 
we currently hold over patents 
we have many pending patent applications  and we intend to file additional patent applications as appropriate 
there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from any of these pending applications or future filings  or that any 
table of contents claims allowed from existing patents or pending or future patent applications will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
while we intend to vigorously protect our intellectual property rights  there can be no assurance that any patents we hold will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to us 
see item legal proceedings for further discussions 
we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary technology that we protect through confidentiality agreements with employees  consultants  and other parties 
there can be no assurance that these parties will not breach these agreements  that we will have adequate remedies for any breach  or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known to or independently developed by others 
there has been substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in semiconductor related industries 
we are currently involved in such litigation 
except as set forth in item legal proceedings  we are not aware of any significant claim of infringement by our products of any patent or proprietary rights of others  however  we could become involved in additional litigation in the future 
although we do not believe the outcome of the current litigation will have a material impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations  no assurances can be given that this litigation or future litigation will not have such an impact 
for further discussion see item legal proceedings 
in addition to the current litigation  our operations including the further commercialization of our products could provoke additional claims of infringement from third parties 
in the future  litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us  to protect trade secrets or know how that we own  to defend ourselves against claimed infringement of the rights of others  or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
any such litigation could result in substantial cost and diversion of our effort and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or operating results 
in addition  adverse determinations in such litigation could result in our loss of proprietary rights  subject us to significant liabilities to third parties  require us to seek licenses from third parties  or prevent us from manufacturing or selling our products 
any of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
employees on december   we had  full time and temporary employees 
none of our employees are represented by a labor union  and we have never experienced a work stoppage  slowdown or strike 
we consider our employee relations to be good 
the success of our future operations depends in large part on our ability to recruit and retain senior management  engineers  technicians  marketing  sales and service professionals and other key personnel 
qualified people are in great demand across each of these industry disciplines  and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in retaining or recruiting key personnel

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we are a supplier of semiconductor manufacturing equipment used in the fabrication of integrated circuits 
demand for our systems can vary significantly from period to period as a result of various factors  including  but not limited to  downturns in the semiconductor industry  supply and demand for semiconductor devices and substantial competition in the semiconductor industry among suppliers of similar products 
for these and other reasons  our results of operations for fiscal  and may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results 
as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we acquired gasonics  a developer and supplier of semiconductor equipment used for photoresist and residue removal  on january  in a pooling of interests transaction 
the consolidated financial statements for fiscal have been restated to include the results of operations and cash flows of gasonics 
because of differing year end periods  financial information relating to novellus fiscal year ended december  has been combined with financial information relating to gasonics fiscal year ended september  gasonics net income for the three months ended december  was not combined with our net income  but rather was included as an adjustment to shareholders equity 
revenue and net income of gasonics for the three month period ended december   which are excluded from the accompanying statements of operations  were million and million  respectively 
there were no transactions between gasonics and novellus prior to the combination 
on december   we completed the acquisition of speedfam ipec  a global supplier of cmp systems used in the fabrication of advanced copper interconnects 
under the terms of the definitive agreement signed on august   we acquired all outstanding shares of speedfam ipec in a stock for stock acquisition whereby each share of speedfam ipec common stock outstanding as of the closing date was converted into of a share of novellus common stock on a fixed exchange ratio basis 
in addition  we assumed all million of speedfam ipec s convertible subordinated notes  originally due in the notes were subsequently paid off in full in january the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase business combination and qualifies as a tax free reorganization under irs regulations 
the consolidated financial statements for fiscal include the financial position  results of operations and cash flows of speedfam ipec from december  for further discussion  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  inventory valuation  goodwill and other intangible assets  deferred tax assets  warranty obligations and restructuring and impairment charges 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the current circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab  revenue recognition in financial statements and sab revenue recognition in financial statements frequently asked questions and answers sab faq 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
certain of our product sales are accounted for as multiple element arrangements 
a multiple element arrangement is a transaction which may involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services  or rights to use assets  and performance may occur at different points in time or over different periods of time 
if we have met defined customer acceptance experience levels with both the customer and the specific type of equipment  then we recognize equipment revenue upon shipment and transfer of title  with the remainder generally recognized at the later of completion of the installation services or customer acceptance 
installation services are not essential to the functionality of the delivered equipment 
we allocate revenue based on the residual method as a fair value has been established for installation services 
however  since the final payment is not typically due until customer acceptance  we defer revenue for the final payment  which is in excess of the fair value of the installation services 
all other equipment sales are recognized upon customer acceptance 
revenue related to spare part sales is recognized upon shipment 
revenue related to maintenance and service contracts is recognized ratably over the duration of the contracts 
unearned maintenance and service contract revenue is not significant and is included in other accrued liabilities 
inventory valuation we assess the recoverability of all inventory  including raw materials  work in process  finished goods and spare parts to determine whether adjustments for impairment are required 
inventory that is obsolete or in excess of our forecasted usage is written down to its estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand is lower than our forecast  additional inventory write downs may be required 
goodwill and other intangible assets effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and identifiable intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment at least annually 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
furthermore  sfas no 
includes provisions on the identification of intangible assets  reclassification of certain intangible assets from previously reported goodwill  and reassessment of the useful lives of existing intangible assets 
upon adoption  we reassessed the useful lives and residual values of all acquired identifiable intangible assets to identify any necessary amortization period adjustments and to determine whether other intangible assets should be reclassified from goodwill 
based on that assessment  no adjustments were made to the amortization period or residual values of identifiable intangible assets 
deferred tax assets we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
our valuation allowance was recorded as an increase to goodwill in connection with acquired net operating loss carryforwards  which are not realizable until and beyond 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
should the existing deferred tax asset  which is currently offset by the valuation allowance  be realized  the benefit of such realization and the related reversal of the valuation allowance would result in a reduction of goodwill 
if we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would decrease income in the period such determination was made 
warranty obligations our warranty policy generally states that we will provide warranty coverage for a predetermined amount of time on systems and modules for material and labor to repair and service the equipment 
we record the estimated cost of warranty coverage to cost of sales 
table of contents upon system shipment 
the estimated cost of warranty is determined by the warranty term  as well as the average historical labor and material costs for a specific product 
should actual product failure rates or material usage differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required 
these revisions could have a positive or negative impact on gross profit 
we review the actual product failure rates and material usage rates on a quarterly basis and adjust our warranty liability as necessary 
restructuring and impairment charges we account for restructuring in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  eitf issue no 
 recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination and sab no 
 restructuring and impairment charges 
accordingly  restructuring accruals are recorded when management initiates an exit plan that will cause us to incur costs that have no future economic benefit 
also under the terms of eitf  a liability for the restructuring charges is recognized in the period management approves the restructuring plan 
additionally  certain restructuring charges related to asset impairments are recorded in accordance with sfas no 
the restructuring accrual related to vacated properties is calculated net of estimated sublease income we expect to receive once we sublet the properties that have been vacated 
sublease income is estimated based on current market quotes for similar properties 
if we are unable to sublet these properties on a timely basis or if we are forced to sublet them at lower rates due to changes in market conditions  we would adjust the accrual accordingly 
results of operations dollars in thousands net sales years ended december  change change in in net sales we operate our business in the semiconductor equipment industry  which is subject to cyclical conditions 
these conditions have played a major role in the fluctuations in our net sales 
the decrease in net sales of from was primarily due to a substantial reduction in customer capital spending in response to weakened worldwide demand for semiconductor devices 
the demand for semiconductor manufacturing equipment has historically fluctuated with changes in the supply of and demand for semiconductor devices and other factors  including rapid technological advances in the semiconductor manufacturing processes 
the increase in net sales of in from was attributable to an increase in sales of our electrofill and mm product lines  partially offset by a decrease in sales of our mm products 
international sales were of net sales in  an increase from in this increase was attributable to higher demand in the asian region  primarily related to higher demand in china  taiwan and korea  and partially offset by lower demand in southeast asia and japan 
the asian region accounted for and of total net sales in and  respectively 
international sales in were down from of total net sales in the decrease in international sales as a percentage of net sales in was a result of lower demand in china  taiwan  southeast asia and korea  partially offset by higher demand in japan 
gross profit years ended december  change change in in gross profit of net sales the decline in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in compared to and was primarily due to the reduced absorption of fixed overhead costs resulting from lower production and shipments 
during and  and through our acquisition of gasonics in january  we expanded our manufacturing facilities to accommodate the unprecedented growth in demand for 
table of contents semiconductor manufacturing equipment 
as a result of the industry downturn and overall slowing economy that began in and continued through  orders for our equipment were not sufficient to fully absorb the fixed overhead costs of these facilities in those periods 
in  we implemented a restructuring plan to consolidate some of our facilities 
the gross profit was reduced by a million charge associated with the write off of inventory related to two products which we discontinued in connection with our restructuring plan 
the gross profit was also impacted by a benefit of million related to our decision not to pay our bonus and profit sharing because we did not meet the minimum performance guidelines required for bonus payment 
in addition  our gross profit is impacted by our treatment of certain product sales as multiple element arrangements in accordance with sab  for which we recognize all of a product s cost upon shipment even though a portion of a product s revenue may be deferred until final payment is due  which is typically upon customer acceptance 
selling  general and administrative years ended december  change change in in selling  general and administrative of net sales selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses include compensation and benefits for corporate  financial  marketing  and administrative personnel  travel  utilities  communications expenses and professional fees 
also included are expenses for rents  depreciation and amortization related to the assets utilized by the functions noted above 
the increase in sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales in over was primarily due to the substantial reduction in net sales 
the decrease in the absolute dollar amount of these expenses reflects the impact of the cost reduction measures that we implemented in the second half of these cost reduction measures include executive and employee pay reductions and facilities consolidation 
in addition  we had workforce reductions in the first and fourth quarter of the decrease in sg a expense  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net sales in over  reflects the impact of the cost reduction measures as well as our decision not to pay million of bonus and profit sharing in as we did not meet the minimum performance guidelines required for bonus payment 
research and development years ended december  change change in in research and development of net sales our significant investments in research and development  or r d  over the past three years reflect our strong commitment to the continuous improvement of our current product lines and the development of new products and technologies 
we plan to continue to focus our r d investment on the continuous improvement of our existing product lines as well as the development of new products and technologies such as advanced pvd and cmp systems  advanced gap fill technology  primary conductor metals  low k dielectric materials  additional advanced deposition and surface preparation technologies for the next generation of smaller geometry fabrication lines and equipment to process mm wafers 
r d expenses include compensation and benefits for our research and development personnel  project materials  chemicals and other direct expenses incurred in product and technology development  repairs and maintenance  rent  depreciation and amortization expenses associated with patents and purchased technologies 
the increase in r d expenses as a percentage of net sales in over was primarily due to the substantial reduction in net sales 
the decrease in the absolute dollar amount of r d expenses from to was due to the decision to lower our investment levels in r d spending 
the increase in r d expenses from to resulted from our continued commitment to invest in new products and technologies 
this increase was partially offset by our decision to cancel the payment of our bonus and profit sharing of million as we did not meet the minimum performance guidelines required for bonus payment 
fiscal r d expense as a percentage of net sales increased from primarily because of the substantial reduction in net sales in this increase in r d expenses as a percentage of net sales reflects our continued commitment to the development of new products and technologies to provide competitive cost advantages for our customers 
despite the downturn in the industry and weakened demand for semiconductor equipment  we continue to believe that substantial investments in r d are critical to remaining competitive and positioning ourselves to meet current and projected requirements of semiconductor fabrication processes 

table of contents acquired in process research and development years ended december  change change in in acquired in process research and development of net sales in connection with the acquisition of speedfam ipec in december  we recorded a million charge to write off certain acquired in process research and development  or ipr d 
projects which qualify as ipr d have not yet reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use 
technological feasibility is defined as being equivalent to completion of a beta phase working prototype in which there is no significant remaining risk relating to the development 
the value assigned to ipr d was determined by considering the importance of each project to the overall development plan  estimating costs to develop the acquired ipr d into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects when completed and discounting the net cash flows to their present value 
the revenue estimates used to value the purchased ipr d were based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in technology and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by speedfam ipec and its competitors 
the rates utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value were based on a weighted average cost of capital determined by examining market information for several comparable companies 
the weighted average cost of capital was adjusted to reflect the difficulties and uncertainties in completing each project and thereby achieving technological feasibility  the percentage of completion of each project  anticipated market acceptance and penetration  market growth rates and risks related to the impact of potential changes in future target markets 
based on these factors  a discount rate of was deemed appropriate for valuing the ipr d 
the estimates used in valuing ipr d were based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
as a result  actual results may differ from estimates 
in fiscal  gasonics recorded a charge of million for the write off of acquired in process research and development associated with the acquisition of gamma precision technologies  inc  or gpt  because certain of gpt s ongoing research and development projects had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
this included development  engineering and testing activities associated with the introduction of gpt s new products and technologies 
restructuring and other charges years ended december  change change in in restructuring and other charges of net sales restructuring and other charges in consisted of million related to vacated facilities and million of severance benefits for workforce reductions 
in  we implemented a restructuring plan and recorded restructuring and asset impairment charges of million and acquisition costs of million related to the acquisition of gasonics 
the restructuring and asset impairment charges included million related to vacated facilities  million related to abandoned assets associated with the discontinuation of certain projects and million related to a write off of abandoned purchased technology 
the discontinuation of two products resulted in a million inventory write down in  which is included in cost of sales for that year 
the charge for vacated facilities relates to rent obligations after the abandonment of certain facilities currently under long term operating lease agreements 
when applicable  anticipated future sublease income related to the vacated buildings has been offset against the charge for the remaining lease payments 
additionally  certain fixed assets  including leasehold improvements  associated with the abandoned facilities that had no future economic benefit have been written off 
except for the future rent obligations and the sublease of the vacated facilities  substantially all actions under the restructuring plan had been achieved as of december  under the restructuring plan  million remains for future rent obligations  which are to be paid in cash over the next four years 
for further discussion  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the restructuring saved us approximately million of expenses in fiscal of the million in savings  million relates to savings from vacated facilities and million relates to savings from workforce reductions 
the acquisition costs related to the acquisition of gasonics included million of professional fees and financial printing and million of other related costs 
the acquisition costs also included charges related to the cancellation of various contracts and the write off of certain redundant assets 
all expenses related to this acquisition have been paid 

table of contents bad debt recovery write off years ended december  change change in in bad debt recovery write off of net sales in september  we determined that an outstanding accounts receivable balance was at risk for collection because the customer was facing financial difficulties  payment was overdue and overall industry conditions continued to deteriorate 
accordingly  we recorded a write off of million 
however  in the first quarter of  all amounts owed under this accounts receivable balance were collected  resulting in a benefit to operations of million 
other income  net years ended december  change change in in other income  net of net sales other income  net  includes interest income  interest expense and other non operating income and expenses 
the decrease in other income  net  from to reflects a decrease in interest income primarily due to a continued decline in interest rates and a decrease in interest bearing investments after we used million of restricted investments to retire substantially all of our liquid yield option tm notes  or lyons  in the third quarter of additionally  we recorded a non cash charge of million for the unamortized issuance costs related to the retirement of the lyons in the third quarter of the decrease in other income in was partially offset by a million gain on the sale of an equity investment 
the increase in other income  net from to is attributable to higher cash and short term investment balances in the second half of the year as a result of the million cash obtained from the lyons  partially offset by an million write down of an equity investment due to an other than temporary decline in fair value 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes reflects an effective tax rate of zero in  in and in the decrease in the effective tax rate compared with the prior years is due primarily to the relative benefit of tax credits being higher due to decreased profitability in deferred tax assets as of december   we had approximately million of deferred tax assets  net of a valuation allowance  related principally to acquired net operating loss carryforwards and items that are not currently deductible 
management believes the deferred tax assets will be realized due to anticipated future income and potentially refundable taxes in available carryback periods 
we have a valuation allowance of million principally related to acquired net operating loss carryforwards  which are not realizable until and beyond 
foreign currency accounting the local currency is the functional currency for all foreign operations 
accordingly  translation gains or losses related to our foreign subsidiaries are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
foreign exchange contracts we conduct our business in various foreign currencies 
forward foreign exchange contracts are used to hedge against the short term impact of foreign currency fluctuations on intercompany accounts payable denominated in us dollars recorded by our japanese 
table of contents subsidiary 
we also enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to buy and sell foreign currencies to hedge our intercompany balances denominated in a currency other than the us dollar 
in and  these hedging contracts were denominated primarily in the japanese yen and the taiwanese dollar 
the forward foreign exchange contracts we use are generally short term in nature 
the effect of exchange rate changes on forward foreign exchange contracts is expected to offset the effect of exchange rate changes on the underlying hedged items 
we believe these financial instruments do not subject us to speculative risk that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates 
net foreign currency gains and losses have not been material to the results of operations 
related parties we lease an aircraft from nvls i  llc  a third party entity wholly owned by richard s

requires disclosure of the pro forma effect in interim financial statements 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  the adoption of sfas no 
has not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  or fin fin will significantly change current practice in the accounting for  and disclosure of  guarantees 
fin requires certain guarantees to be recorded at fair value  which is different from the current practice of recording a liability only when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable  as those terms are defined in sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
fin also requires a guarantor to make significant new disclosures  even when the likelihood of making any payments under the guarantee is remote  which is another change from the current practice 
fin disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december   while the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of fin on our results of operations or financial condition 
in january  the fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin is effective for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  we are currently evaluating our synthetic leases and seeking additional information from the lessor and its advisors with regard to whether the lessor should be characterized as a variable interest entity 
consequently  we have not yet concluded whether it is reasonably possible that we would be required to record the specific assets and liabilities associated with our synthetic leases in our financial statements for our third fiscal quarter beginning on june  in the event the leasing structures used in our synthetic leases qualify as variable interest entities  we would seek to refinance with entities with whom we would not be required to consolidate or purchase the properties by exercising our purchase option 
for further discussion  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operating and capital resource requirements through cash flows from operations  sales of equity securities and borrowings 
our primary source of funds as of december  consisted of  million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
this amount represents an increase of million from the december  balance of million 
the increase is primarily due to net cash provided by operating activities  which is attributable to net income  as adjusted to exclude non cash charges and benefits and changes in working capital 
the increase is partially offset by our decision to participate in the synthetic leases 
our participation in the synthetic lease transactions is further discussed below 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million 
the primary sources of cash from operating activities were net income  as adjusted to exclude non cash charges and benefits and changes in working capital requirements  including notable decreases in accounts receivable  inventories and prepaid and other current assets 
the decrease in accounts receivable is attributable to the decrease in net sales and improved cash collections 
the decrease in inventories  as adjusted to exclude inventories acquired from speedfam ipec  is due to a lower inventory level as a result of certain inventory management programs initiated in the decrease in prepaid and other current assets is primarily due to a million income tax refund received during the year 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december  the cash inflows from investing activities consist primarily of billion in proceeds from sales and maturities of available for sale securities and restricted investments  partially offset by purchases of new investments of billion 
additionally  we acquired million of net cash upon the closing of the acquisition of speedfam ipec on december  the cash inflows were partially offset by million of capital expenditures and million of cash used for collateral in synthetic lease transactions 
we did not have any significant property and equipment purchase commitments as of december  for the year ended december   net cash used in financing activities was million  which was attributable to the million retirement of the lyons  million for repurchases of common stock  and million for repayment of borrowings under lines of credit 
the cash used in financing activities is partially offset by proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock option and stock purchase plans 

table of contents the following is a table summarizing our significant commitments as of december   consisting of future minimum lease payments under all non cancelable operating leases  including synthetic leases  with initial or remaining terms in excess of one year and debt payments related to the convertible debentures assumed as part of our acquisition of speedfam ipec 
these convertible debentures were redeemed in january amounts payable under synthetic leases exclude any payments under residual value guarantees and relate only to the net lease financing amounts 
in addition  payments under synthetic leases are subject to changes in the london interbank offer rate libor and have been included using interest rates on december  in thousands convertible operating debt leases thereafter total commitments we lease nearly all of our facilities under operating leases  including synthetic leases  which expire at various dates through a synthetic lease is a form of operating lease wherein a third party lessor funds of the acquisition and construction costs relating to one or more properties to be leased to a lessee 
the lessor is the owner of the leased property and must provide at least of the required funds in the form of at risk equity 
the lessor generally borrows the balance of the funds necessary to fund the acquisition and construction 
under our synthetic lease agreements  we are obligated to lend approximately of the cost of the leased asset to the lessor upon completion of construction 
the leases with this requirement are known as defeased or self funded transactions 
additionally  our synthetic leases require us to maintain collateral for the benefit of the lessor 
the san jose lease agreement covers properties located in and around san jose  california  including manufacturing  research and development  and administrative facilities  as well as our corporate headquarters 
the lease has a term of five years beginning in september and covers properties with original values of approximately million 
the lease agreement requires the lessor to provide of at risk equity throughout the term of the lease 
the remaining of the lessor s financing was in the form of debt  including million loaned to the lessor which is classified as notes receivable on our balance sheet 
we have also provided the lessor with million in collateral  which is classified within other assets on our balance sheet 
under the lease agreement  we have the right to purchase the properties at any time prior to the expiration date of the lease for an amount that equals the total lease financing amount of million plus any current rent due and payable 
at the end of the lease term  we may renew the lease for up to three additional years with the lessor s consent  refinance the lease  purchase the properties under a purchase option or arrange to sell the properties to a third party 
if we choose the sale option we will be obligated to the lessor up to the amount of the residual value guarantee if the sale price falls below the lease financing amount 
the aggregate residual value guarantee related to the san jose properties is approximately million as of december   and represents an off balance sheet contingent liability for which we do not believe that we have any significant exposures as discussed below 
rent payments under the san jose lease agreement are based on the net outstanding lease balance  which includes the cost of the leased properties  less the amount defeased by us  multiplied by either a fixed rate or libor plus an applicable margin 
as of december   the net outstanding lease balance and the amount we have defeased were million  and million  respectively 
rent expense and interest income on the lease balance includes million of imputed amounts at rates of to for the year ended december  imputed amounts result from the application of a deemed market rate of interest on loan balances  including the lease receivable from the lessor  which is non interest bearing  and a portion of the collateral  which is interest bearing at lower than the deemed market rate of interest 
our lease receivable from the lessor is repayable in full only if we choose the sale option at the end of the lease term and successfully sell the properties for amounts in excess of the cost 
our collateral is available to the lessor upon default  with certain exceptions 
on april   we entered into a synthetic lease agreement for the development of a manufacturing  research and development and administrative facility to be constructed on acres of land we own in tualatin  oregon 
we have leased the land to the lessor under a long term ground lease 
construction was completed at the tualatin site in may the construction costs totaled million and were fully financed by the lessor 
the lease agreement requires the lessor to maintain of at risk equity throughout the term of 
table of contents the lease 
the lessor financed the balance of the construction costs with debt 
upon completion of construction  we defeased million of the lessor s debt financing in the form of a non interest bearing loan to the lessor  which is included in notes receivable on our balance sheet at december  we have also provided million in collateral held by the lessor to cover the remainder of the lease financing  which is classified as other assets on our balance sheet 
we have the right to purchase the property at any time prior to the expiration date of the lease for an amount that equals the total lease financing amount of million  plus any current rent due and payable 
at the end of the five year lease term  we may renew the lease for up to three additional years with the lessor s consent  purchase the property under the purchase option for an amount equal to the total lease financing amount or arrange to sell the property to a third party 
if we choose the sale option  we will be obligated to the lessor up to the amount of the residual value guarantee if the sale price falls below the lease financing amount 
the residual value guarantee related to the tualatin property is approximately million as of december  and represents an off balance sheet contingent liability for which we do not believe that we have any significant exposure as discussed below 
rent payments under the tualatin lease agreement are based on the net outstanding lease balance  which includes the cost of the leased properties  less the amount defeased by us  multiplied by either a fixed rate or libor  plus an applicable margin 
as of december   the net outstanding lease balance and the amount we have defeased were million and million  respectively 
rent expense and interest income on the lease balance includes million of imputed amounts at rates of to for the year ended december  imputed amounts result from the application of a deemed market rate of interest on loan balances  including the lease receivable from the lessor  which is non interest bearing  and a portion of the collateral  which is interest bearing at lower than the deemed market rate of interest 
our lease receivable from the lessor is repayable in full only if we choose the sale option at the end of the lease term and successfully sell the property for an amount in excess of the cost 
our collateral is available to the lessor upon default  with certain exceptions 
if we purchase the san jose and tualatin properties at the end of their respective lease terms or earlier  the transactions would increase property and equipment by the lower of the purchase option price or the then fair value of the purchased properties 
as of december   we believe that the fair market value for each property exceeds the purchase option price for each property 
we estimate the cumulative fair value of all properties to be approximately million as of december  upon purchase of the properties  our note receivable and collateral would be returned to us as cash or used to offset the purchase price of the properties 
as a result of the purchase  depreciation expense would increase by approximately million to million per year  and rent expense and interest income would each decrease by approximately million per year  based on current interest rates 
if we purchased the properties at the end of their respective lease terms or earlier  we believe there would be no material impact on our liquidity  as the cash paid to purchase the properties would be offset by the note receivable and collateral associated with our participation in these leases 
the synthetic lease agreements contain certain restrictive covenants  which include quick ratio and tangible net worth tests 
we were in compliance with these covenants as of december  if we had not complied with these covenants  the lessor could have terminated the leases  resulting in an acceleration of our purchase obligation  in which case  our residual value guarantee would have equaled of the lease balances 
our intention with respect to the properties we lease under synthetic leases is dependent upon the treatment of our lessor under fin if the lessor is deemed to be a voting interest entity  we would expect to continue the synthetic lease arrangements and exercise our three one year renewals subject to obtaining the lessor s consent 
if our lessor is deemed to be a variable interest entity and we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary  we would seek to refinance with entities with whom we would not be required to consolidated or purchase the properties by exercising our purchase option 
the maximum exposure to loss on our synthetic leases includes i residual value guarantee payments as described above  ii certain tax indemnifications in the event third parties are obligated for certain federal  state or local taxes as a result of their participation in the transaction  and iii indemnification for various losses  costs and expenses incurred by third party participants as a result of their ownership of the leased property or participation in the transaction  and as a result of the environmental condition of the property 
the additional taxes  losses and expenses as described in ii and iii are contingent upon the existence of certain conditions that may arise in the future and  therefore  are not quantifiable at this time 
however  we do not expect these additional taxes  losses and expenses to be material 
in addition  as noted above  we have funded advances to the lessor in the aggregate amounts of million for the san jose facilities and million for the tualatin facilities  and have deposited with the lessor investment collateral in the amount of million for the san jose facilities and million for the tualatin facilities as a source of payment for our obligations for the residual value guarantee payments and other amounts owed under the leases 

table of contents as of december   our subsidiaries had no outstanding obligation under lines of credit with banks 
the available lines of credit with these banks total million 
these credit facilities bear interest at various rates  expire on various dates through december and are used for general corporate purposes 
as of december   amounts outstanding under these lines of credit were million at an annual weighted average interest rate of 
there were no balances outstanding under these lines of credit as of december  on december   in connection with the acquisition of speedfam ipec  we assumed speedfam ipec s million convertible subordinated notes due in the notes accrue interest at a rate of  which is payable semi annually in march and september and were adjusted to their fair value of million as of the acquisition date 
the notes were subordinated to all existing and future senior indebtedness and could be converted into shares of novellus common stock at a conversion price of per  principal amount 
we had the right to redeem the notes at various prices  subject to specified conditions as set forth in the indenture 
we called the notes on january  at a redemption price of million  which represents of par value 
we recognized approximately million in expense in january as a result of the redemption of the notes 
the million expense represents the difference between the carrying value and the redemption price of the notes 
on july   we issued million of liquid yield option notes lyons due july  the net proceeds after issuance costs which were being amortized over years from the lyons offering were million 
the lyons are zero coupon  zero yield subordinated debentures convertible into shares of our common stock or redeemable for cash by the security holder  subject to specified conditions as set forth in the indenture 
on july   the holders of the lyons exercised their option to require us to repurchase the lyons for  in cash each on such date  or approximately million for substantially all of the outstanding lyons 
we used restricted short term investments  which had matured to million  to repurchase the lyons 
we recorded a charge of approximately million in other expenses for the remaining unamortized issuance costs related to the lyons 
we believe that our current cash position  cash generated through operations and equity offerings  and available borrowings will be sufficient to meet our needs through at least the next twelve months 
risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  including in item management s discussion and analysis  and in other documents we file with the securities and exchange commission are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this annual report 
cyclical downturns in the semiconductor industry our business depends predominantly on the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers  which in turn depend on current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and the products that use them 
the semiconductor industry has historically been very cyclical and has experienced periodic downturns that have had a material adverse effect on the demand for semiconductor processing equipment  including equipment that we manufacture and market 
during periods of reduced and declining demand  we must be able to quickly and effectively align our costs with prevailing market conditions  as well as motivate and retain key employees 
in particular  our inventory levels during periods of reduced demand have at times reached and are now at higher than necessary levels relative to the current levels of production demand 
we cannot provide any assurance that we may not be required to make inventory valuation adjustments in future periods 
during periods of rapid growth  we must be able to acquire and or develop sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet customer demand  and hire and assimilate a sufficient number of qualified people 
we cannot give assurances that our net sales and operating results will not be adversely affected if the current downturn in the semiconductor industry continues  or if other downturns or slowdowns in the rate of capital investment in the semiconductor industry occur in the future 
the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and capital intensive we face substantial competition in the industry  both from potential new entrants into the market and established competitors 
some of these companies may have greater financial  marketing  technical or other resources than we do  as well as broader product lines  greater customer service capabilities  or larger and more established sales organizations and customer bases 
remaining competitive in the market depends in part upon our ability to develop new and enhanced systems  and to introduce them at competitive prices on a timely basis 

table of contents our customers must incur substantial expenditures to install and integrate capital equipment into their semiconductor production lines 
once a manufacturer has selected another vendor s capital equipment  the manufacturer is generally reliant upon that equipment vendor for the specific production line application in question 
accordingly  we may experience difficulty in selling a product to a particular customer for a significant period of time when that customer has selected a competitor s product 
in addition  sales of our systems depend in significant part upon a prospective customer s decision to increase manufacturing capacity or expand current manufacturing capacity both of which typically involve a significant capital commitment 
from time to time  we have experienced delays in finalizing system sales following initial system qualification 
due to these and other factors  our systems typically have a lengthy sales cycle  during which we may expend substantial funds and management effort 
rapidly changing technology we devote a significant portion of our personnel and financial resources to research and development programs  and we seek to maintain close relationships with our customers in order to remain responsive to their product needs 
as is typical in the semiconductor capital equipment market  we have experienced delays from time to time in the introduction of and certain technical and manufacturing difficulties with certain of our products and product enhancements 
in addition  we may experience delays and technical and manufacturing difficulties in future introductions or volume production of our new systems or enhancements 
our success in developing  introducing and selling new and enhanced systems depends upon a variety of factors 
these include product selection  timely and efficient completion of product design and development  timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing and assembly processes  product performance in the field  and effective sales and marketing 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in selecting  developing  manufacturing and marketing new products  or in enhancing our existing products 
in addition  we could incur substantial unanticipated costs to ensure the functionality and reliability of our future product introductions early in their product life cycles 
if new products have reliability or quality problems  reduced orders  or higher manufacturing costs  then delays in collecting accounts receivable and additional service and warranty expenses may result 
any of these events could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
international operations export sales currently account for a significant portion of our net sales 
this trend is expected to continue in the foreseeable future 
as a result  a significant portion of our sales is subject to certain risks  including  but not limited to tariffs and other trade barriers  challenges in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary operations  difficulties in managing foreign distributors  potentially adverse tax consequences  imposition of legislation and regulations relating to the import or export of semiconductor products  either by the united states or other countries  periodic economic downturns  political instability  and fluctuations in interest and foreign currency exchange rates  creating the need to enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge against the short term impact of foreign currency fluctuations  specifically yen denominated transactions 
there can be no assurance that any of these factors or the adoption of restrictive policies will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  each region in the global semiconductor equipment market exhibits unique market characteristics that can cause capital equipment investment patterns to vary significantly from period to period 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from customers in asian countries 
any negative economic developments in these countries could result in the cancellation or delay by asian customers of orders for our products  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
variability of quarterly operating results we have experienced and expect to continue experiencing significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
these fluctuations are due to a number of factors that include  but are not limited to building our systems according to forecast  and not using limited backlog information  which hinders our ability to plan production and inventory levels  failure to receive anticipated orders in time to permit shipment during that quarter  customers rescheduling or canceling shipments  manufacturing difficulties  customers deferring orders of our existing products due to new product announcements by us and or our competitors  and 
table of contents overall business conditions in the semiconductor equipment industry 
variations in quarterly operating results or changes in analysts earnings estimates may subject the price of our common stock to wide fluctuations and possible rapid increases or declines in a short time period 
acquisitions we have made and may in the future make acquisitions of or significant investments in businesses with complementary products  services and or technologies 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including  but not limited to difficulties in integrating the operations  technologies  products and personnel of acquired companies  lack of synergies or the inability to realize expected synergies  difficulties in managing geographically dispersed operations  the potential loss of key employees  customers and strategic partners of acquired companies  diversion of management s attention from normal daily operations of the business  and the impairment of acquired intangible assets as a result of technological advancements  or worse than expected performance of acquired companies 
acquisitions are inherently risky  and we cannot provide any assurance that our previous or future acquisitions will be successful 
the inability to effectively manage the risks associated with previous or future acquisitions could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
a large portion of net sales is derived from sales to a few customers we currently sell a significant proportion of our systems in any particular period to a limited number of customers  and we expect that sales of our products to relatively few customers will continue to account for a high percentage of our net sales in the foreseeable future 
in addition  we believe that sales to certain of our customers will decrease in the near future as they complete current purchasing requirements for new or expanded fabrication facilities 
although the composition of the group comprising our largest customers varies from year to year  the loss of a significant customer or any reduction in orders from any significant customer including reductions due to customer departures from recent buying patterns  as well as economic or competitive conditions in the semiconductor industry could adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
intellectual property we intend to continue pursuing the legal protection of our proprietary technology primarily through patent and trade secret protection 
there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from any of these pending applications  or that any claims allowed from existing or pending patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary technology 
there is also no guarantee that any patents we hold will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented  or that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to us 
we also cannot provide assurance that the confidentiality agreements we enter into with employees  consultants and other parties will not be breached 
we are currently involved in a number of legal disputes regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
except as set forth in item legal proceedings in this document  we are not aware of any significant claim of infringement by our products of any patent or proprietary rights of others 
adverse outcomes in current or future legal disputes could result in our loss of proprietary rights  subject the company to significant liabilities to third parties  require us to seek licenses from third parties  or prevent us from manufacturing or selling our products 
any of these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
supply shortages we use numerous suppliers to obtain parts  components and sub assemblies for the manufacture and support of our products 
although we make reasonable efforts to ensure that such parts are available from multiple suppliers  certain key parts may only be obtained from a single or limited source 
these suppliers are in some cases thinly capitalized  independent companies that generate significant portions of their business from us and or a small group of other companies in the semiconductor industry 
we seek to reduce our dependence on this limited group of sources 
however  disruption or termination of certain of these suppliers may occur 
such disruptions could have an adverse effect on our operations 
a prolonged inability to obtain certain parts could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations  and could result in our inability to meet customer demands on time 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and short term debt obligations 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we mitigate default risk by investing in only the safest and highest credit quality securities and by monitoring the credit rating of investment issuers 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
we have no material cash flow exposure due to rate changes for cash equivalents and short term investments 
the majority of our short term obligations have fixed interest rates  including the convertible bonds assumed in connection with the speedfam ipec acquisition  all of which were subsequently redeemed in january therefore  our results are only affected by the interest rate changes to variable rate short term borrowings 
due to the short term nature of these borrowings  an immediate change to interest rates is not expected to have a material effect on our results 
the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted interest rates by year of maturity for our investment portfolio and debt obligations and the fair value of each as of december  and all of our available for sale investments and debt securities mature within two years from the original purchase or issuance date

rent expense may increase significantly with changes in prevailing interest rates 
excluded from the table above is million of collateralized investments recorded within other assets and as a note receivable  related to our participation in the synthetic leases 
of this amount  million is subject to interest rate risk since amounts payable as rent expense are based on libor 
the remaining balance of rent expense is either paid using a fixed rate of interest or is non 
table of contents interest bearing 
imputed amounts result from the application of a deemed market rate of interest on loan balances  including the lease receivable from the lessor  which is non interest bearing  and a portion of the collateral  which is interest bearing at lower than the deemed market rate of interest 
since interest is imputed for financial reporting and disclosure purposes only  market risk is not associated with these instruments 
for further discussion  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
foreign currency risk we transact business in various foreign countries 
our primary foreign currency cash flows are in asia and europe 
during and  we utilized foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency denominated balance sheet positions 
under this program  increases or decreases in currency commitments and balance sheet positions  as translated into us dollars  were primarily offset by realized gains and losses on the hedging instruments 
the goal of the hedging program is to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our results of operations 
we do not use foreign currency forward exchange contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
all of our unsettled foreign currency contracts are marked to market  with unrealized gains and losses included as a component of other income and expense
