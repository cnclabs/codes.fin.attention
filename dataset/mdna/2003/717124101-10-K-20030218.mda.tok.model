item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis is provided to increase understanding of  and should be read in conjunction with  the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
in this discussion  the words ppd  we  our and us refer to pharmaceutical product development  inc  together with its subsidiaries where appropriate 
forward looking statements this form k contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws 
these statements relate to future events or our future financial performance 
forward looking statements include statements concerning plans  objectives  goals  strategies  future events or performances  expectations  predictions  assumptions and other statements that are not statements of historical facts 
in some cases  you can identify forward looking statements by terminology such as might  will  should  expect  plan  anticipate  believe  estimate  predict  intend  potential or continue  or the negative of these terms  or other comparable terminology 
these statements are only predictions 
these statements rely on a number of assumptions and estimates which could be inaccurate and which are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual events or results might differ materially due to a number of factors  including those listed in potential volatility of quarterly operating results and stock price and in part i item business factors that might affect our business or stock price 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements are reasonable  we cannot guarantee future results  levels of activity  performance or achievements 
we generally undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason  even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future 
acquisitions in february  ppd acquired of the outstanding common stock of medical research laboratories international  inc mrl us and medical research laboratories international  bvba mrl belgium  collectively  mrl 
mrl is part of the development group of ppd 
mrl us operates a central laboratory near cincinnati  ohio  and mrl belgium operates a central laboratory in brussels  belgium 
mrl provides highly standardized efficacy and safety testing services for pharmaceutical companies engaged in clinical drug development

ppd acquired prc for total consideration of million  including million in cash  million in ppd s common stock million unregistered shares and direct acquisition costs of million for legal and accounting fees 
in june  ppd acquired complete software solutions  inc  or css  a technical consulting firm offering a full range of implementation  validation and training services as well as specialized software for pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries 
css is part of the development group of ppd 
ppd acquired css for total consideration of million in cash 
in june  ppd acquired propharma pte ltd  an asian based clinical research organization with extensive experience in managing pan asian clinical trials 
propharma is part of the development group of ppd 
ppd acquired propharma for total consideration of million in cash 
in addition  ppd agreed to pay up to million as additional purchase price  depending upon the financial performance of propharma for a specified period following the acquisition 
these acquisitions were accounted for using the purchase method  utilizing appropriate fair value techniques to allocate the purchase price based on the estimated fair values of the assets and liabilities 
accordingly  
table of contents the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed were included in ppd s consolidated balance sheet as of the effective date of the acquisitions 
the results of operations are included in ppd s consolidated results of operations as of and since the effective dates of the acquisitions 
there were no significant differences between the accounting policies of ppd or any of the companies acquired in these acquisitions 
for further details regarding these acquisitions  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
results of operations we recognize revenues from fixed price contracts on a proportional performance basis in our development group 
to measure the performance  we compare actual direct costs incurred to estimated total contract direct costs  which is the best indicator of the performance of the contract obligations as the costs relate to the labor hours incurred to perform the service 
we recognize revenues from time and materials contracts as hours are incurred  multiplied by the billable rates for each contract in both our development group and discovery sciences group 
for our phase and laboratory businesses  we also recognize revenues from unitized contracts as subjects or samples are tested  multiplied by the price of each 
in connection with the management of multi site clinical trials  we pay on behalf of our customers fees to investigators and test subjects  and other out of pocket costs  such as travel  printing  meetings  couriers  etc  for which we are reimbursed at cost 
effective january   in connection with the required implementation of eitf  amounts paid by us as a principal for out of pocket costs are now included in direct costs  while the reimbursements we receive as a principal are reported as reimbursed out of pocket revenues in the income statement 
we plan to continue to net revenue and expense in the income statement from fees and associated reimbursements that we receive as an agent 
prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with current year presentation 
most contracts are terminable either immediately or after a specified period following notice by the client 
these contracts typically require payment to us of expenses to wind down a study  payment to us of fees earned to date  and in some cases  a termination fee or some portion of the fees or profit that we could have earned under the contract if it had not been terminated early 
discovery sciences group revenues also include nonrefundable technology license fees and milestone payments 
the non refundable license fees are generally up front payments for the initial license of and access to our technology 
for nonrefundable license fees received at the initiation of license agreements for which we have an ongoing research and development commitment  we defer these fees and recognize them ratably over the period of the related research and development 
for nonrefundable license fees received under license agreements where our continued performance of future research and development services is not required  we recognize revenue upon delivery of the technology 
in addition to license fees  our discovery sciences group also generates revenue from time to time in the form of milestone payments 
milestone payments are only received and recognized as revenues if the specified milestone is achieved and accepted by the customer and continued performance of future research and development services related to that milestone are not required 
although these payments are typically lower than up front license fees  these payments can be significant because they are triggered as a result of achieving specified scientific milestones 
we receive milestone payments in connection with sublicensing of compounds and in association with our target validation work 
we record our recurring operating expenses among five categories direct costs  research and development  selling  general and administrative  depreciation  and amortization 
direct costs consist of appropriate amounts necessary to carry out the revenue and earnings process  and include direct labor and related benefit charges  other costs directly related to contracts  an allocation of facility and information technology costs  and reimbursable out of pocket expenses 
direct costs  as a percentage of net revenues  tend to and are expected to fluctuate from one period to another as a result of changes in labor utilization and the mix of service offerings involved in the hundreds of studies conducted during any period of time 

table of contents research and development  or r d  expenses consist primarily of labor and related benefit charges associated with personnel performing internal research and development work  supplies associated with this work and an allocation of facility and information technology costs 
selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses consist primarily of administrative payroll and related benefit charges  sales  advertising and promotional expenses  recruiting and relocation expenses  administrative travel  an allocation of facility and information technology costs and costs related to professionals working in an indirect capacity 
depreciation expenses consist of depreciation costs recorded on a straight line method  based on estimated useful lives of to years for buildings  five years for laboratory equipment  three years for computers and related equipment and four to ten years for furniture and equipment  except for our airplane  which we are depreciating over years 
leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the respective lives of the leases or the useful lives of the improvements 
property under capital leases is depreciated over the life of the lease or the service life  whichever is shorter 
amortization expenses consist of amortization costs recorded on intangible assets on a straight line method over the life of the intangible assets 
the excess of the purchase price of a business acquired over the fair value of net tangible assets  identifiable intangible assets and acquired in process research and development costs at the date of the acquisition has been assigned to goodwill 
goodwill was being amortized over periods of to years prior to january  in july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  or sfas no 
we adopted sfas no 
as of january  and no longer amortize goodwill 
the provisions of this accounting standard also require the completion of a transitional impairment test within six months of adoption 
we completed the transitional impairment test as of january  and the annual impairment test as of october  and did not identify any impairments of goodwill 
these tests involved determining the fair market value of each of the reporting units with which the goodwill was associated and comparing the estimated fair market value of each of the reporting units with its carrying amount 
amortization expense related to goodwill for was million 

table of contents the following tables set forth amounts for certain items in our consolidated financial statements expressed as a percentage of net revenue  before reimbursed out of pockets  from continuing operations and the percentage changes in dollar amounts of certain items compared with the prior period 
the following tables exclude revenue and costs related to reimbursable out of pocket expenses because they are not generated by the services we provide  do not yield any gross profit to us  and do not have any impact on our net income 
thus  we believe this information is useful to our investors because it presents the revenue and expenses that are directly attributable to the services we provide to our clients and provides a more accurate picture of our operations results and margins

in addition  acquisitions in the development group completed during contributed net revenue of million for the discovery sciences group generated net revenue of million in  a decrease of million  or  from the higher discovery sciences net revenue was primarily attributable to a milestone payment generated in the first quarter of from sublicensing the compound dapoxetine to alza corporation  now a part of johnson johnson 
total direct costs increased to million in from million in total direct costs  excluding reimbursable out of pocket expenses  increased to million in from million in  and decreased slightly as a percentage of net revenue to in from for development group direct costs increased to million in as compared to million for this increase resulted primarily from increased personnel costs due to the increase in the size and number of contracts in the global cro phase through services and the direct costs associated with acquisitions completed during development group direct costs decreased as a percentage of related net revenue from in to in this decrease was principally due to the mix of levels of personnel involved in the contracts performed  variations in the utilization of personnel and the mix of contracts being performed during each period 
discovery sciences direct costs decreased to million in as compared to million for the higher discovery sciences direct costs were primarily due to the costs associated with sublicensing dapoxetine to alza in the first quarter of r d expenses increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in spending on r d in the discovery sciences group to develop intellectual property 
as of the end of  the discovery sciences group had almost doubled the number of employees working on internal r d projects as compared to the end of we expect internal r d spending to continue to increase in both target validation and the chemistry ggtase programs 
sg a expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to additional administrative personnel costs and an increase in recruiting  travel and training costs associated with new operational employees hired to support our expanding operations 
as a percentage of net revenue  excluding reimbursed out of pockets  sg a expenses decreased to in from for this decrease is primarily attributable to the increase in revenue  and to a smaller extent  to increased efficiencies as our operations expand 
depreciation expense increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase was related to the depreciation of the increased investment in property and equipment due primarily to our growth 
capital expenditures were million in the majority of our capital investment in was due to additional facility and equipment costs to increase laboratory capacity  costs to enhance and expand our information technology capacity and computer software and hardware for new employees 
amortization expense was million in and million in during  amortization of backlog associated with the acquisition of mrl accounted for million of the amortization expense 
during  amortization of goodwill accounted for million of the amortization expense 
we adopted sfas no

see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of sfas operating income increased million to million in  as compared to million in as a percentage of net revenue  excluding reimbursed out of pockets  operating income increased to of net 
table of contents revenue in from in this increase was primarily due to our revenue growth and our focus on controlling the increase in both direct and administrative costs 
during the first quarter of  we recorded a million write down of the carrying value of our investment in dna sciences  inc for an other than temporary decline in value 
our investment in dna sciences was deemed to be impaired as a result of historical and projected performance  cash needs and an independent valuation of the market value of dna sciences 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an impairment of equity investment of million to write down the carrying value of our investments in gallery systems  inc formerly digital arts and sciences corporation and intrabiotics pharmaceuticals  inc for an other than temporary decline in value 
our provision for income taxes increased million  or  to million in  as compared to million in we recorded a net tax benefit of million and a deferred tax valuation allowance of million associated with the million impairment of equity investments 
this valuation allowance was recorded due to the uncertainty of utilizing the capital loss benefit prior to the expiration of the loss carryforward period 
our effective income tax rate  excluding this million tax benefit and the related impairment expense of million  remained constant at approximately 
net income of million in represents a decrease of million from million in this includes million of impairment of equity investments and million related to tax benefit 
net income per diluted share of in represents a decrease from in net income per diluted share in net income per diluted share of in includes a loss of related to the impairment of equity investments and the tax benefit associated with this write down

the discovery sciences group generated net revenue of million in  an increase of million  or  from the growth in the discovery sciences operations was primarily attributable to revenue generated from sublicensing the compound dapoxetine to alza corporation in the first quarter of and the payments from eli lilly and company in for relinquishing our rights to all compounds other than dapoxetine licensed by us in total direct costs increased to million in from million in total direct costs  excluding reimbursable out of pocket expenses  increased to million in from million for and decreased as a percentage of net revenue to in as compared to in the development group s direct costs increased to million in as compared to million in this increase resulted primarily from increased personnel costs due to the increase in the size and number of contracts in the global cro phase through services 
the development group s direct costs decreased as a percentage of related net revenue to in from in this decrease is principally due to the mix of levels of personnel involved in the contracts performed  variations in the utilization of personnel and the mix of contracts being performed during each period 
discovery sciences direct costs increased to million in as compared to million in this increase was primarily due to the costs associated with sublicensing dapoxetine and the increase in the functional genomics services direct costs associated with its increased fte revenue 
r d expenses increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to the increase in spending on r d in the discovery sciences group 
as of the end of  the 
table of contents discovery sciences group had more than double the number of employees working on r d as compared to the end of sg a expenses increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily attributable to additional administrative personnel costs and an increase in recruiting and training costs associated with new hires to support our expanding operations 
as a percentage of net revenue  excluding reimbursed out of pockets  sg a expenses decreased to in from in this decrease is primarily attributable to the increase in revenue and  to a smaller extent  to increased efficiencies as our operations expand 
depreciation expense increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase was related to the depreciation on the increased investment in property and equipment due primarily to our growth 
capital expenditures were million in as compared to million in the majority of our capital investment in was for the acquisition of a new airplane to replace our previous plane  which was more than years old  additional facility costs related to our laboratories to increase capacity  additional software licenses related to our increase in headcount and additional scientific equipment in our laboratories 
amortization expense remained relatively consistent at approximately million in as compared to million for during and  amortization of goodwill accounted for million of the amortization expense 
operating income increased million to million in  as compared to million in as a percentage of net revenue  excluding reimbursed out of pockets  operating income increased to of net revenue in from in this increase was primarily due to our revenue growth and our focus on controlling the increase in both direct and administrative costs 
our provision for income taxes increased million  or  to million in  as compared to million in our effective income tax rate increased to in from in because we conduct operations on a global basis  our effective tax rate has and will continue to depend upon the geographic distribution of our pretax earnings among locations with varying tax rates 
in particular  as the geographic mix of our pre tax earnings among various tax jurisdictions changes  our effective tax rate might vary from period to period 
in october  we made an investment in apothogen  inc given the involvement of the chairman of our board of directors and our chief executive officer in apothogen  we were accounting for our investment in apothogen under the equity method of accounting 
equity in net loss of investee  net of income taxes  was million for in april  apothogen was acquired by intrabiotics pharmaceuticals  inc and we received intrabiotics common stock in exchange for our stock in apothogen 
the investment in intrabiotics no longer qualifies for equity method accounting 
net income of million in represents an increase of million over million in net income per diluted share of in represents an increase from in net income per diluted share in liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents on hand 
our expected primary cash needs on both a short and long term basis are for capital expenditures  expansion of services  possible acquisitions  geographic expansion  working capital and other general corporate purposes 
we have historically funded our operations and growth  including acquisitions  with cash flow from operations  borrowings and sales of our stock 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates on cash equivalents and amounts outstanding under notes payable  notes receivable and lines of credit 
our cash and cash equivalents are invested in financial instruments that are rated a or better by standard poor s or moody s and earn interest at market rates 
in  our operating activities provided million in cash as compared to million last year 
the increase in cash flow from operations is primarily due to an increase in our net revenues  an increase in 
table of contents operating margins as a percentage of net revenues and our effort to control accounts receivable 
in  net income of million  impairment of equity investments of million  depreciation and amortization of million and a net increase of million in net operating assets and liabilities were partially offset by the million decrease in deferred income taxes 
in  our investing activities used million in cash 
the net cash used for acquisitions of million  purchases of investments of million and capital expenditures of million were partially offset by million received from the repayment of notes receivable 
in  our financing activities provided million in cash  as net proceeds from stock option exercises and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan totaling million and proceeds from long term debt of million were partially offset by million in repayments of capital lease obligations 
working capital as of december  was million  compared to million at december  the increase in working capital was due primarily to the increase in accounts receivable and unbilled services  net  of million and the increase in cash of million which were partially offset by the increase in unearned income of million  the increase in payables to investigators of million and the increase in other accrued expenses of the number of days revenue outstanding in accounts receivable and unbilled services  net of unearned income  also known as dso  were and days as of december  and december   respectively 
this improvement is a result of a focused effort by management on improving the accounts receivable collection process along with temporary improved terms regarding investigator fee down payments 
we expect dso in the future will fluctuate depending on the mix of contracts performed within a quarter and our success in collecting receivables 
we maintain a defined benefit pension plan for certain employees and former employees in the united kingdom 
the projected benefit obligation for the benefit plan at december  and december   as determined in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  was million and million  respectively  and the value of the plan assets was million and million  respectively 
as a result  the plan was under funded by million at december  and by million at december  due to the decline in the fair market value of the plan asset  it is likely that the amount of our contributions to the plan will increase from the million of contributions made in in addition  we expect the pension cost to be recognized in the financial statements will decrease from the million recognized in to approximately million in the expense to be recognized in future periods could increase further  depending upon the amount of the change in fair market value of the plan assets and the change in the projected benefit obligation 
the decrease in the market value of plan assets is likely to cause the amount of the under funded status to increase 
though we have not yet determined the exact amount of such under funding  after completion of the actuarial valuations in we could be required to record an additional reduction to shareholders equity 
we recorded a reduction to shareholders equity in of million 
however  we do not believe the under funded status of the pension plan will materially affect our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
moreover  given the impact that the discount rate and stock market performance have on the projected benefit obligation and market value of plan assets  future changes in either one of these may significantly reduce or increase the amount of our pension plan under funding 
in june  we amended our revolving credit facility for million from wachovia bank  na  formerly known as first union national bank 
the purpose of the amendment was to extend the expiration date 
indebtedness under the facility is unsecured and subject to traditional covenants relating to financial ratios 
borrowings under this credit facility are available to provide working capital and for general corporate purposes 
as of december   there was no amount outstanding under this credit facility 
this credit facility is currently scheduled to expire in june  at which time any outstanding balance will be due 
in july  we entered into a new revolving credit facility for million with bank of america  n 
a 
indebtedness under the facility is unsecured and subject to traditional covenants relating to financial ratios 
borrowings under this credit facility are available to provide working capital and for general corporate purposes 
as 
table of contents of december   there was no amount outstanding under this credit facility 
this credit facility is currently scheduled to expire in june  at which time any outstanding balance will be due 
in april  we made an investment in spotlight health  inc  formerly known as adoctorinyourhouse 
com 
in january  we entered into an agreement with spotlight health and wachovia bank  na to guarantee a revolving million line of credit provided to spotlight health by wachovia 
indebtedness under the line is unsecured and subject to traditional covenants relating to financial ratios 
as of december   spotlight health had million outstanding under this credit facility 
this credit facility is currently scheduled to expire in june  at which time any outstanding balance will be due 
we review the financial statements of spotlight health on a quarterly basis to determine if it has sufficient financial resources to continue operations 
while we do not have current concerns regarding spotlight health s ability to repay this facility  should events and circumstances in the future change spotlight health might not be in the position to repay the facility and wachovia might attempt to collect on our guaranty of this facility 
we expect to continue expanding our operations through internal growth and strategic acquisitions 
we expect these activities will be funded from existing cash  cash flow from operations and borrowings under our existing or future credit facilities 
we believe that these sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future  but offer no assurances 
from time to time  we evaluate potential acquisitions and other growth opportunities  which might require additional external financing  and we might seek funds from public or private issuances of equity or debt securities 
in particular  our sources of liquidity could be affected by our dependence on a small number of industries and clients  compliance with regulations  international risks  personal injury  environmental or intellectual property claims  as well as other factors described under factors that might affect our business or stock price  potential volatility of quarterly operating results and stock price  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  and critical accounting policies and estimates 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments future minimum payments for all contractual obligations for years subsequent to december  are as follows in thousands total and thereafter long term debt  including interest payments operating leases less sublease income total other commercial commitments include the guarantee we provide on spotlight health s million line of credit 
see full details on this arrangement in the liquidity and capital resources section 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of our accounting policies that affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we have discussed the application of these critical accounting policies with our board of directors and its finance audit committee 
the majority of our revenues are recorded from fixed price contracts on a proportional performance basis 
to measure performance  we compare actual direct costs incurred to estimated total contract direct costs  which is the best indicator of performance of the contract obligations as the costs relate to the labor hours incurred to perform the service 
direct costs are primarily comprised of labor overhead related to the delivery of services 
each month costs are accumulated on each project and compared to the budget for that particular project 
this determines the percentage of completion on the project 
this percentage is multiplied by the contract value to determine the 
table of contents amount of revenue that can be recognized 
each month management reviews the budget on each project to determine if the assumptions within the budget are still correct and budgets are adjusted accordingly 
as the work progresses  original estimates might be deemed incorrect due to  among other things  revisions in the scope of work or patient enrollment rate  and a contract modification might be negotiated with the customer to cover additional costs 
if not  we bear the risk of cost overruns 
in the past  we have had to commit unanticipated resources to complete projects  resulting in lower gross margins on those projects 
we might experience similar situations in the future 
should our estimated costs on fixed price contracts prove to be low  future margins could be reduced  absent our ability to negotiate a contract modification 
we accumulate information on each project to refine our bidding process 
historically  the majority of our estimates and assumptions have been materially correct  but these estimates might not continue to be accurate 
in addition  clients generally may terminate a study at any time  which might cause unplanned periods of excess capacity and reduced revenues and earnings 
to offset the effects of early terminations of significant contracts  we attempt to negotiate the payment of an early termination fee as part of the original contract 
in our discovery science group  we generate revenue from time to time in the form of milestone payments 
milestone payments are only received and recognized as revenues if the specified milestone is achieved and accepted by the customer and continued performance of future research and development services related to that milestone are not required 
although these payments are typically lower than up front license fees  these payments can be significant because they are triggered as a result of achieving specified scientific milestones 
future potential milestone payments under various discovery contracts might never be received if the milestones are not achieved 
included in accounts receivable and unbilled services  net on our consolidated balance sheets is a reserve for doubtful accounts 
generally  before we do business with a new client  we have a credit check performed on that company to determine if they have a satisfactory credit rating 
senior management reviews the accounts receivable aging on a monthly basis to determine if any receivables will potentially be uncollectable 
we include any accounts receivable balances that are determined to be potentially uncollectable  along with a general reserve  in our overall reserve for doubtful accounts 
after all attempts to collect the receivable have failed  the receivable is written off against the reserve 
based on the information available to us  we believe our reserve for doubtful accounts as of december  was adequate 
however  actual write offs might exceed the recorded reserve 
most of our investments consist of equity investments in private entities for which fair values are not readily determinable 
therefore  all of our investments are recorded under the cost method of accounting 
many of our investments are in relatively early stage life sciences or biotechnology companies that do not have established products or proven technologies and may not have any material revenue 
therefore  these investments are particularly subject to write down for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these investments may not be recoverable 
we assess our investment portfolio on a quarterly basis to determine whether declines in the market value of these securities are other than temporary 
this quarterly review includes an evaluation of  among other things  the market condition of the overall industry  historical and projected financial performance  expected cash needs and recent funding events 
given the nature of these companies  our assessments of value are subjective 
based on estimates of future taxable profits and losses in certain foreign tax jurisdictions  management determined that a valuation allowance of million was required for specific foreign tax loss carryforwards as of december  if these estimates prove inaccurate  a change in the valuation allowance  up or down  could be required in the future 
we also recorded a total valuation allowance of  related to the impairment of certain equity investments  of which relates to the tax effect of an item in other comprehensive income 
the valuation was determined based on the uncertainty regarding our ability to utilize some of the potential capital losses generated during the loss carryforward period 
a change in any of the investees financial health and or stock price  or a change in our ability to utilize a potential capital loss  could require a change of valuation allowance in the future 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset might not be recoverable 
if indicators of impairment were present  we would evaluate the carrying value of property and equipment in relation to estimates of future undiscounted cash flows 
these undiscounted cash flows and fair values are based on judgment and assumptions 
additionally  goodwill is tested for 
table of contents impairment on at least an annual basis by comparing the underlying reporting units goodwill to their estimated fair value 
we did not identify any impairment of goodwill during our transitional impairment test or annual impairment test of goodwill upon adoption of sfas these tests involved the use of estimates related to the fair market value of the reporting unit with which the goodwill was associated 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  or sfas no 
 which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
sfas requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material effect on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  or sfas no 
sfas no 
addresses accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value when the liability is incurred 
sfas no 
is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  ppd does not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material effect on our financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued emerging issues task force consensus no 
 or eitf  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred 
eitf requires that in cases where the contractor acts as a principal  reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred be characterized as revenue and the associated costs included as operating expenses in the income statement 
ppd implemented this rule as of january  and  as required  has reclassified comparative financial information for and the implementation of this rule resulted only in the gross up of revenues and expenses and had no impact upon earnings 
at the october meeting of the emerging issues task force eitf of the fasb  the eitf reached a consensus on issue and issue of eitf issue no 
 recognition of customer relationship intangible assets acquired in a business combination  eitf 
on issue  the eitf concluded that the contractual legal and separability criteria do not restrict the use of certain assumptions that would be used in estimating the fair value of an intangible asset 
assumptions such as expectations of future contract renewals and other benefits related to the intangible asset must be considered in the estimates of fair value regardless of whether they meet the contractual legal or separability criteria 
on issue  the eitf concluded that the contractual legal criterion provision of sfas applies if an entity has a practice of establishing contracts with its customers 
thus  an entity would recognize a customer relationship at the date of the business combination even if there were no contracts in existence at that date since the entity has a practice of establishing contracts with its customers 
the eitf also observed that this consensus addresses only the recognition of customer relationships and does not address the valuation of such customer relationships 
these consensuses should be applied on a prospective basis for all business combinations consummated after october  we do not expect the adoption of this consensus to have a material effect on our financial statements 
in november  the eitf finalized its tentative consensus on eitf issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which provides guidance on the timing and method of revenue recognition for sales arrangements that include the delivery of more than one product or service 
eitf is effective prospectively for arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this consensus on our financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 or fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  an interpretation of fasb statement nos 
  and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
fin clarifies the requirements of fasb statement no 
 accounting for 
table of contents contingencies  relating to the guarantor s accounting for  and disclosure of  the issuance of certain types of guarantees 
fin requires that upon issuance of a guarantee  the guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee 
the disclosure provisions of fin are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods that end after december  fin s provisions for initial recognition and measurement should be applied on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   irrespective of the guarantor s fiscal year end 
the guarantor s previous accounting for guarantees that were issued before the date of fin s initial application may not be revised or restated to reflect the effect of the recognition and measurement provisions of fin we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material effect on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
this statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
this statement requires that companies having a year end after december  follow the prescribed format and provide the additional disclosures in their annual reports 
we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material effect on our financial statements 
taxes because we conduct operations on a global basis  our effective tax rate has and will continue to depend upon the geographic distribution of our pretax earnings among locations with varying tax rates 
our profits are also impacted by changes in the tax rates of the various taxing jurisdictions 
in particular  as the geographic mix of our pre tax earnings among various tax jurisdictions changes  our effective tax rate might vary from period to period 
inflation our long term contracts  those in excess of one year  generally include an inflation or cost of living adjustment for the portion of the services to be performed beyond one year from the contract date 
as a result  we expect that inflation generally will not have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition 
potential liability and insurance drug development services involve the testing of new drugs on human volunteers pursuant to a study protocol 
this testing exposes us to the risk of liability for personal injury or death to patients resulting from  among other things  possible unforeseen adverse side effects or improper administration of the new drug 
many of these patients are already seriously ill and are at risk of further illness or death 
we attempt to manage our risk of liability for personal injury or death to patients from administration of products under study through measures such as stringent operating procedures and contractual indemnification provisions with clients and through insurance maintained by clients 
we monitor our clinical trials in compliance with government regulations and guidelines 
we have adopted global standard operating procedures intended to satisfy regulatory requirements in the united states and in many foreign countries and serve as a tool for controlling and enhancing the quality of our clinical trials 
the contractual indemnifications generally do not protect us against our own actions  such as negligence 
we currently maintain professional liability insurance coverage of up to million per claim  with an annual aggregate policy limit of million 
potential volatility of quarterly operating results and stock price our quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated in the past  and we expect that they will continue to fluctuate in the future 
factors that could cause these fluctuations include our dependence on a small number of industries and clients  the timing of the initiation  progress or cancellation of significant projects  
table of contents the mix of products and services sold in a particular period  our need to recruit and retain experienced personnel  rapid technological change and the timing and amount of start up costs incurred in connection with the introduction of new products and services  intellectual property risks  the timing of our discovery sciences group milestone payments or other revenue  the timing of the opening of new offices  the timing of other internal expansion costs  the timing and amount of costs associated with integrating acquisitions  and exchange rate fluctuations between periods 
delays and terminations of trials are often the result of actions taken by our customers or regulatory authorities and are not typically controllable by us 
because a large percentage of our operating costs are relatively fixed while revenue is subject to fluctuation  variations in the timing and progress of large contracts can materially affect our quarterly operating results 
we believe that comparisons of our quarterly financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
fluctuations in quarterly results or other factors beyond our control could affect the market price of our common stock 
such factors include changes in earnings estimates by analysts  market conditions in our industry  changes in pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries  general economic conditions  and differences in assumptions used as compared to actual results 
any effect on our common stock could be unrelated to our longer term operating performance 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to foreign currency risk by virtue of our international operations 
we conduct business in several foreign countries 
approximately  and of our net revenues  less reimbursed out of pockets  for the years ended december   and  respectively  were derived from operations outside the united states 
funds generated by each subsidiary are generally reinvested in the country where they are earned 
we have not  to date  engaged in derivative or hedging activities related to our potential foreign exchange exposures 
our operations in the united kingdom generated more than of our international net revenue  less reimbursed out of pockets  from international operations during accordingly  we do have some exposure to adverse movements in the pound sterling and other foreign currencies 
the united kingdom has traditionally had a relatively stable currency compared to our functional currency  the us dollar 
we anticipate that those conditions will continue for at least the next months  but cannot make any guarantees 
the vast majority of our contracts are entered into by our united states or united kingdom subsidiaries 
the contracts entered into by the united states subsidiaries are almost always denominated in united states dollars 
contracts entered into by our united kingdom subsidiaries are generally denominated in pounds sterling  united states dollars or euros 
contractual provisions either limit or reduce the economic risk in certain transactions involving multiple currencies 
we do have some currency risk resulting from the passage of time between the invoicing of customers under contracts and the ultimate collection of customer payments against those invoices 
if a contract is denominated in a currency other than the subsidiary s local currency  we recognize a receivable at the time of invoicing for the local currency equivalent of the foreign currency invoice amount 
changes in exchange rates from the time the invoice is prepared and payment from the customer is received will result in our receiving either more or less in local currency than the local currency equivalent of the invoice amount at the time the invoice was prepared and the receivable established 
we recognize this difference as a foreign currency transaction gain or loss  as applicable  and report it in other income  net 
if exchange rates were to change by in the future  we do not expect this to have a material effect on our financial statements 

table of contents changes in exchange rates between the applicable foreign currency and the us dollar will affect the translation of foreign subsidiaries financial results into us dollars for purposes of reporting our consolidated financial results 
the process by which each foreign subsidiary s financial results are translated to us dollars is as follows income statement accounts are translated at average exchange rates for the period  balance sheet assets and liability accounts are translated at end of period exchange rates  and equity accounts are translated at historical exchange rates 
translation of the balance sheet in this manner affects the shareholders equity account  referred to as the cumulative translation adjustment account 
this account exists only in the foreign subsidiary s us dollar balance sheet and is necessary to keep the foreign balance sheet  stated in us dollars  in balance 
translation adjustments are reported with accumulated other comprehensive income loss as a separate component of shareholders equity 
to date  cumulative translation adjustments have not been material to our consolidated financial position 
however  adjustments could in the future be material to our financial statements 
there are no material exchange controls currently in effect in any country in which we conduct operations on the payment of dividends or otherwise restricting the transfer of funds outside these countries 
although we perform services for clients located in a number of foreign jurisdictions  to date  we have not experienced any difficulties in receiving funds remitted from foreign countries 
however  if any of these jurisdictions imposed or modified existing exchange control restrictions  the restrictions could have an adverse effect on our financial condition 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates on our cash equivalents and amounts outstanding under notes payable and lines of credit 
we invest our cash and cash equivalents in financial instruments with interest rates based on financial market conditions 
if interest rates were to change by in the future  we do not expect this to have a material effect on our financial statements
