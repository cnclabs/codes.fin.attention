in  our most complex accounting judgments were made in the areas of software revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  restructuring and other special non recurring charges  impairment of long term strategic investments  the provision of income taxes and stock based compensation 
the restructuring and other special non recurring charges are not anticipated to be recurring in nature 
however  the financial reporting of restructuring and other special non recurring charges will continue to require judgments until such time as the corresponding accruals are fully paid out and or no longer required 
software revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  impairment of long term strategic investments  provision for income taxes and stock based compensation are expected to continue to be ongoing elements of our accounting processes and judgments 
software revenue recognition with respect to software revenue recognition  we recognize revenues in accordance with the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition and related accounting guidance and pronouncements 

table of contents revenues from perpetual software license agreements are recognized upon receipt of an executed license agreement  or an unconditional order under an existing license agreement  and shipment of the software  if there are no significant remaining vendor obligations  collection of the receivable is probable and payment is due within twelve months 
revenues from license agreements requiring the delivery of significant unspecified software products in the future are accounted for as subscriptions and  accordingly  are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement from the first instance of product delivery 
due to the complexity of some software license agreements  we routinely apply judgments to the application of software revenue recognition accounting principles to specific agreements and transactions 
different judgments and or different contract structures could have led to different accounting conclusions  which could have had a material effect on our reported earnings 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain doubtful accounts allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
at the time of a transaction  we assess whether the fee associated with the revenue transaction is fixed and determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and the creditworthiness of the customer 
we also assess whether collection is reasonably assured 
if any portion of a fee is due after days from the invoice date  we account for the fee as not being fixed and determinable 
in these cases  we recognize revenue as the fees become due 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including previous transactions with the customer and the creditworthiness of the customer 
we do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
we base our ongoing estimate of allowance for doubtful accounts primarily on the aging of the balances in the accounts receivable  our historical collection patterns and changes in the creditworthiness of our customers 
while credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
our accounts receivable include material balances from a limited number of customers  with five customers accounting for of accounts receivable at each of december  and for more information on our customer concentration  see our related discussion in certain factors that may affect our business 
therefore  changes in the assumptions underlying this assessment or changes in the financial condition of our customers could result in a different required allowance  which could have a material impact on our reported earnings 
as of december   accounts receivable totaled million  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
restructuring and other special non recurring charges on june   we announced that our board of directors had approved a restructuring program to refocus on the most significant market opportunities and to reduce operating costs due to the macroeconomic factors that were negatively affecting technology investment in the market 
the restructuring program included a workforce reduction  consolidation of excess facilities  and discontinuance of non core products and programs 
as a result of the restructuring program and the impact of the macroeconomic conditions on us and our global base of customers  we recorded restructuring and other special non recurring charges  excluding goodwill impairment  of million in the second quarter of  with a subsequent increase of million in the second half of and a reduction of million in the first half of we conducted our assessment of the accounting effects of the restructuring program in accordance with eitf no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an 
table of contents activity  sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations and the relevant provisions of the sec s sab no 
 restructuring and impairment charges 
our assessment required assumptions in estimating the original accrued restructuring charges of million on june   including estimating future recoveries of sublet income from excess facilities  liabilities from employee severances  and costs to exit business activities 
changes in these assessments with respect to the accrued restructuring charges of million at december   could have a material effect on our reported results 
during the second quarter of  we recorded adjustments to reduce the accrued restructuring charges by million  which were made to reflect savings realized as a result of the successful completion of certain contractual obligations in a cost effective manner 
as of june  we had initiated all actions required by the restructuring plan 
in addition  actual results could vary from these assumptions  in particular with regard to the sublet of excess facilities  resulting in an adjustment that could have a material effect on our future financial results 
impairment of long term strategic and equity investments we assess the recoverability of the carrying value of strategic investments at least annually 
factors that we consider important in determining whether an assessment is warranted and could trigger impairment include  but are not limited to  the likelihood that the company in which we invested would have insufficient cash flows to operate for the next twelve months  significant changes in the company s operating performance or business model and changes in overall market conditions 
these investments are in private companies of which we typically own less than of the outstanding stock 
because there is not a liquid market for these securities  we often must make estimates of the value of our investments 
we recorded charges related to other than temporary declines in the value of certain strategic investments of million in we also recorded a gain on the disposition of a long term strategic investment of million in it was also determined that a further adjustment to the carrying value of the investments was necessary during in the amount of million  to reflect other than temporary declines in the value of certain strategic investments 
further write downs may be required in future depending upon our assessment of the performance of the underlying investee companies at that time 
as of december   long term strategic investments  net of valuation allowances  amounted to million 
in april  we began accounting for our investment in entrust japan under the equity method in accordance with the provisions of apb no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock and arb no 
 consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  on the step by step acquisition method  we recorded a retroactive adjustment to consolidated accumulated deficit to record our share of the post acquisition losses of entrust japan of prior years of  as required by this accounting guidance 
this retroactive adjustment is attributable to our pro rata share of losses recorded by entrust japan during the period in which we owned less than of their voting stock  to the extent of our previous investment 
our balance sheet at december   as reported in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report  has been restated to reflect this retroactive adjustment 
prior years comparative results have been restated in and to reflect this retroactive adjustment 
in addition  we recorded our share of post acquisition losses of entrust japan  in the amount of  in our consolidated losses for these losses are attributable to our pro rata share of entrust japan s losses in  while we had an equity ownership of approximately of their voting stock 
during  entrust japan exceeded the performance targets established at the date of increased investment 
however  due to entrust japan s history of operating losses  it is possible that all or substantially all of the remaining million equity investment in entrust japan at december  may be expensed through our operating earnings in future quarters as a result of our recognition of our equity share of losses in entrust japan 
as of december   we believe that there has not been an impairment of our investment in entrust japan 

table of contents provision for income taxes the preparation of our consolidated financial statements require us to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate  including those outside the united states 
in addition  we have based the calculation of our income taxes in each jurisdiction based upon inter company agreements 
the income tax accounting process involves our estimating our actual current exposure in each jurisdiction together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we then record a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
we recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   which represents the full value of our deferred tax assets  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets due to our recent history of financial losses 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to adjust our valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
stock based compensation our stock option program is a broad based  long term retention program that is intended to contribute to our success by attracting  retaining and motivating talented employees and to align employee interests with the interests of our existing stockholders 
stock options are typically granted to employees when they first join us but can also be granted when there is a significant change in an employee s responsibilities and  occasionally  to achieve equity within a peer group 
the compensation committee of the board of directors may  however  grant additional options to executive officers and key employees for other reasons 
under the stock option plans  the participants may be granted options to purchase shares of common stock and substantially all of our employees and directors participate in at least one of our plans 
options issued under these plans generally are granted at fair market value at the date of grant  become exercisable at varying rates  generally over three or four years and generally expire ten years from the date of grant 
we recognize that stock options dilute existing shareholders and have attempted to control the number of options granted while remaining competitive with our compensation packages 
at december   a large percentage of our outstanding employee stock options carried exercise prices in excess of the closing market price on that day 
all stock option grants are made with the approval of the compensation committee of the board of directors 
we account for our stock option plans under the recognition and intrinsic value measurement principles of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related accounting guidance 
accordingly  no stock based compensation expense is reflected in net earnings for grants under these plans  as all options granted under these plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to stock based compensation  the effect would have been to increase our net loss in  and to million  million and million  respectively  and consequently  increase our net loss per share to  and for  and  respectively 
however  entrust believes that the expenses that would be recorded under sfas no 
are not as meaningful as a careful consideration of the outstanding option data  which is disclosed in note n of our consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this annual report 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth certain statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated year ended december  revenues license services and maintenance total revenues cost of revenues license services and maintenance total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative acquired in process research and development amortization of purchased product rights amortization of goodwill and other purchased intangibles impairment of goodwill  purchased product rights and other purchased intangibles restructuring charges and adjustments write down of leaseholds and other long lived assets total operating expenses loss from operations other income expense interest income loss from equity investment realized gain loss on investments write down of long term strategic investments total other income expense loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net loss years ended december   and revenues we generate revenues from licensing the rights to our software products to end users and  to a lesser extent  from sublicense fees from resellers 
we also generate revenues from consulting  training and post contract support  or maintenance  performed for customers who license our products 
we recognize revenues in accordance with the provisions of the sop no 
 software revenue recognition and related accounting guidance and pronouncements 

table of contents revenues from perpetual software license agreements are recognized as revenue upon receipt of an executed license agreement  or an unconditional order under an existing license agreement  and shipment of the software  if there are no significant remaining vendor obligations  collection of the receivable is probable and payment is due within twelve months 
revenues from license agreements requiring the delivery of significant unspecified software products in the future are accounted for as subscriptions and  accordingly  are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement from the first instance of product delivery 
revenues from maintenance services are recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance period  which is typically one year 
if maintenance services are included free of charge or discounted in a license agreement  such amounts are unbundled from the license fee at their fair market value based upon the value established by independent sales of such maintenance services to other customers 
revenues from the sale of web server certificates are also recognized ratably over the term of the certificate  which is typically one to two years 
consulting and training revenues are generally recognized as the services are performed 
consulting services are typically performed under separate service agreements and are usually performed on a time and materials basis 
such services primarily consist of implementation services related to the installation and deployment of our products and do not include significant customization or development of the underlying software code 
we use the percentage of completion method to account for fixed price custom development contracts 
under this method  we recognize revenue and profit as the work on the contract progresses 
revenues are recognized by applying the percentage of the total cost incurred to date divided by the total estimated contract cost to the total contract value  and any projected loss is recognized immediately 
the project cost estimates are reviewed on a regular basis 
total revenues 
total revenues in were million  which represented a decrease of from the million of total revenues in  which in turn  represented a decrease from the million of total revenues in total revenues derived from north america of million in represented a decrease of from the million in  which in turn  represented a decrease from the million in total revenues derived from outside of north america of million in represented a decrease of from the million in  which in turn  represented a decrease from the million in the majority of the overall decline in total revenues in and was experienced in canada  europe  asia and other international locales  which was mainly due to the continued softening of the economic climate internationally and to our restructuring plan from the second quarter of  which resulted in fewer sales resources being applied in all regions  particularly in asia pacific and latin america 
in addition  we generated significant revenues from the government of canada secure channel project in  from software deliveries  accounted for on a subscription basis  and the first phase of the professional services work related to this project 
these revenues were difficult to replace in the level of non north american revenues has fluctuated from period to period  and this trend is expected to continue for the foreseeable future 
the decline in the level of north american revenues  in and  reflected the prolonged economic downturn experienced in this region and throughout the industry  with customers buying to their immediate needs  as opposed to buying total project or enterprise wide  in the tough economic market 
however  the lower percentage year over year decrease in revenues derived from north america  in compared to  is due to increased activity in in the extended government vertical in the united states  resulting from a higher customer demand for our digital certificate solutions in that market sector 
in and  no individual customer accounted for or more of revenues 
in  a single customer accounted for of revenues  while no other customers accounted for or more of revenues 
license revenues 
license revenues of million in represented a decrease of from the million in  which in turn  represented a decrease of from the million in these revenues represented  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
the decrease in license revenues in absolute dollars in and was primarily driven by the softened economic climate 
table of contents internationally and the shift from new project software spending to service driven deployment in the extended government vertical 
new project purchases remain subject to governmental budgetary constraints 
in addition  the global downturn has had a significant impact on information technology projects and the commitments that customers have made to expenditures in this area 
license revenues as a percentage of total revenues remained flat from to  due to decreased services and maintenance revenues in the first half of  largely as a result of the timing delay in contracting additional services revenues from the government of canada secure channel project  coupled with continued demand for the entrust secure web portal solutions and enterprise desktop suite  offset by decreased license revenues caused by the absence of government of canada secure channel software revenues in license revenues as a percentage of total revenues decreased from to  primarily as a result of a continued strong demand for services and maintenance from our customers and increased professional services revenues from the addition of cygnacom in march  and encommerce in june  and partly due to decreased license revenues in services and maintenance revenues 
services and maintenance revenues of million in represented a decrease of from the million in  which in turn  represented an increase of from the million in these revenues represented  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
the decrease in services and maintenance revenues in is due to slowed demand for consulting services and customer support  resulting from the diminished growth of the license revenue base of customers experienced during and and the timing of corresponding support contract renewals on this license revenue base 
in addition  to a greater degree we have been fulfilling our customers deployment needs in conjunction with partners  as our solutions are now easier to deploy and  as a result  the demand for our consulting services has declined for customer deployment and integration requirements 
this is particularly true in europe  where several large system integration contracts in europe underpinned the services revenues in the first half of that year 
the increase in services and maintenance revenues in absolute dollars from to was primarily the result of an increase in demand for consulting services and customer support  the acquisitions of cygnacom and encommerce  and increases in maintenance revenues from a larger installed product base and strong customer renewals of annual maintenance agreements 
services and maintenance revenues as a percentage of total revenues for compared to remained flat  mainly due to the continued improvements achieved in the utilization of our global professional services organization  offset with a shift in the mix of revenues from services and maintenance to license revenues during the first half of this shift was largely due to an increase in demand for our enhanced security solutions  particularly the entrust secure web portal solutions  combined with the decrease in services and maintenance business in as a result of the timing of customer demand 
the increase in services and maintenance revenues as a percentage of total revenues from to reflected a shift in the mix of revenues from license to services and maintenance revenues in  compared to previous years 
this shift was largely due to the continued growth of our services and maintenance business in response to customer demand  the impact of the professional services revenues of cygnacom and encommerce since their respective acquisitions  and the decrease in license revenues during cost of revenues cost of license revenues 
cost of license revenues consists primarily of costs associated with product media  documentation  packaging and royalties to third party software vendors 
amortization of purchased product rights of million  million and million in  and  respectively  acquired as part of the june acquisition of encommerce  has been excluded from cost of license revenues and instead has been included in operating expenses 
cost of license revenues was million in  million in and million in  representing  and of total revenues for the respective years 
the decrease in cost of license revenues in absolute dollars was primarily a result of lower license revenues in compared to prior years and savings realized as a result of renegotiated royalty agreements with some third party software vendors 
the cost of license revenues as a percentage of total revenues remained flat for compared to due to the overall lower total revenues in the mix of third party products may vary from period to period and  consequently  our gross margins and results of operations could be adversely affected 
the increase in the 
table of contents cost of license revenues as a percentage of total revenues from to  despite the lower software license revenue levels  was primarily a result of higher royalty rates paid to third party software vendors and an increase in the number of third party technologies embedded in our products sold 
the mix of third party products may vary from period to period and  consequently  our gross margins and results of operations could be adversely affected 
cost of services and maintenance revenues 
cost of services and maintenance revenues consists primarily of personnel costs associated with customer support  training and consulting services  as well as amounts paid to third party consulting firms for those services 
cost of services and maintenance revenues was million in  million in and million in  representing  and of total revenues for the respective years 
the decrease in the cost of services and maintenance revenues in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total revenues in primarily reflected the decreased costs associated with lower levels of services and maintenance revenues experienced during this year and the elimination of certain unprofitable services business lines as part of our restructuring in june further  the decrease of cost of services and maintenance revenues as a percentage of total revenues reflected a decline in services and maintenance revenues and an increase in license revenues in the first half of  compared to the same period in the increase in absolute dollars in reflected the increased costs associated with the increased levels of services and maintenance revenues experienced in those periods and the increased costs associated with the cygnacom and encommerce resources 
the increase in the cost of services and maintenance revenues as a percentage of total revenues in reflected the rapid growth of services and maintenance revenues in comparison to license revenues  and the significant shift in the mix of revenues from license to services and maintenance revenues during this period 
as the services and maintenance revenues represented the larger proportion of total revenues and grew faster than total revenues  the cost of generating those services and maintenance revenues represented a much larger percentage when compared against total revenues  because significant investment was necessary in order to meet this demand 
also  we made significant investments in additional customer support personnel in services and maintenance gross profit as a percentage of services and maintenance revenues was in  in and in the increase in the services and maintenance gross profit as a percentage of services and maintenance revenues from to reflected the lower costs associated with professional services and operating efficiencies achieved in the form of higher productivity and utilization of available services resources compared to the previous year  combined with a shift in the services revenues mix from lower margin professional services revenues to higher margin support and maintenance revenues 
we also eliminated certain unprofitable services business lines as part of our restructuring plan in june the decrease in the services and maintenance gross profit as a percentage of services and maintenance revenues from to reflected the investment we made in the professional services team through the acquisition of cygnacom late in the first quarter of and encommerce at the end of the second quarter of  which represented a slight shift in the mix of components within services revenues toward the lower margin professional services revenues 
in addition  the decrease in the services and maintenance gross profit as a percentage of services and maintenance revenues reflected the investment made in additional customer support personnel in  and the continued development and rollout of new services offerings prior to our restructuring in the second quarter of operating expenses operating expenses sales and marketing year ended december  in thousands per statement of operations less special non recurring charges included pro forma pro forma sales and marketing as a percentage of total revenues 
table of contents sales and marketing expenses decreased to million in from million in and million in  on a pro forma basis  representing  and of total revenues in the respective years 
the decrease in absolute dollars in was due mainly to the cost reduction strategies implemented through our restructuring plan  which took effect in june since the restructuring  our sales and marketing expenses have better matched our revenue generation 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars from to was primarily the result of costs associated with the expansion of our sales and marketing organization  both domestically and internationally  up until the end of the first half of and the implementation of our restructuring plan in june until that time we had continued to make significant investments in sales and marketing to support the launch of new products  markets  services and marketing programs 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues in  compared to  reflected the cost savings from the restructuring plan  and the lower than expected revenue achievement in the first half of compared to in addition  we have implemented significant efficiencies into our sales processes and continued greater discipline in expense management 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues in  compared to  was mainly due to the combination of lower than expected license revenues in the first half of  and sales and marketing expenses that were largely fixed prior to the beginning of each of the first two quarters of based on the expectation of higher license revenues for that period that did not materialize 
we intend to continue to focus on improving the productivity of our sales and marketing organizations and on gaining efficiencies in the related processes in light of current economic conditions 
however  until the implementation of our restructuring plan  we continued to make significant investments in sales and marketing to support the launch of new products  services and marketing programs by maintaining our strategy of a investing in hiring and training our direct and partner sales organizations in anticipation of future market growth  and b investing in marketing efforts in support of new product launches 
failure of these investments in sales and marketing  as adjusted through our restructuring plan  to generate future revenues will have a significant adverse effect on our operations 
while we are focused on marketing programs and revenue generating opportunities to increase software revenues  there can be no assurances that these initiatives will be successful 
during  the allowance for doubtful accounts decreased by million as a result of better cash collections during the period and  consequently  an additional bad debt expense was not required in we had recorded bad debt write offs and additional provisions for doubtful accounts totaling million in  included in the above special non recurring charges  which was recorded primarily in sales and marketing expenses 
the credit to sales and marketing expenses for special non recurring charges in reflected savings realized in the negotiation and completion of certain contractual obligations  identified under our restructuring program  in a cost effective manner 
operating expenses research and development year ended december  in thousands per statement of operations less special non recurring charges included pro forma pro forma research and development as a percentage of total revenues research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in and million in  representing  and of total revenues in the respective years 
the decrease in research and development expenses in absolute dollars in was due mainly to the cost reduction strategies implemented through our restructuring plan  which took effect in june in addition  employees were hired during the first half of  primarily in connection with the continuing expansion and enhancement of our 
table of contents product offerings and our commitment to quality assurance and testing  and globalization of these product offerings 
this also accounted for the increase in research and development expenses from to research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues for decreased compared to due mainly to the lower research and development spending resulting from a reprioritization of resources to strategic solutions  coupled with continued management discipline in operating expenses in the investment in research and development as a percentage of total revenues increased in  compared to  due primarily to the lower than expected license revenues in the first half of  as these costs were largely fixed prior to the start of the first two quarters of  and due to the acquisition of encommerce and the corresponding addition of the getaccess development team in june the cost reduction impact of our restructuring on research and development expenses did not come into effect until june however  we believe that we must continue to maintain our investment in research and development in order to maintain our technological leadership position  software quality and security assurance leadership and thus  expect research and development expenses may have to increase in absolute dollars in the future if additional experienced security experts and software engineers are required 
operating expenses general and administrative year ended december  in thousands per statement of operations less special non recurring charges included pro forma pro forma general and administrative as a percentage of total revenues general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in and million in  on a pro forma basis  representing  and of total revenues in the respective years 
general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars remained flat between and  while the increase in these expenses from to reflected our continued investment in increased staffing and related expenses for the enhancement of the infrastructure necessary to support our changing business  including investor relations programs  improved management information systems and the increased utilization of outside professional services  prior to our restructuring in june general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased in and  compared to the prior years  due primarily to the lower than expected revenues in and  as these expenses include a high degree of fixed costs 
we continue to look for ways to gain additional efficiencies in our administrative processes and contain expenses 
acquired in process research and development and amortization of goodwill  purchased product rights and other purchased intangibles in june  the financial accounting standards board approved for issuance sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  which revised the accounting for purchased goodwill and intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will no longer be amortized  but will be tested for impairment annually and also in the event of an impairment indicator 
we adopted sfas no 
as of january  this adoption has affected the amortization of intangibles  resulting from the following past acquisitions on march   we completed the acquisition of cygnacom solutions inc  a company based in mclean  virginia that delivers information technology products and services  with expertise in public key infrastructure  cryptographic technologies  security engineering and systems integration and development 
pursuant to the stock purchase agreement dated march   entered into between us  cygnacom and the 
table of contents shareholders of cygnacom  we agreed to acquire all of the outstanding shares of cygnacom for an aggregate purchase price of million  which included cash consideration of million 
the acquisition was recorded under the purchase method of accounting and  therefore  the results of operations of cygnacom are included in our financial statements from the acquisition date 
upon consummation of the acquisition  cygnacom became a wholly owned subsidiary 
in connection with this acquisition  we recorded goodwill of million and  accordingly  we expensed million and million of goodwill amortization in and  respectively 
no goodwill amortization was recorded in  due to the adoption of sfas no 
on june   we completed the acquisition of encommerce  inc  a company based in santa clara  california that provides software and services for managing global e business relationships 
the acquisition of encommerce s outstanding capital stock  options and warrants for a total consideration of million was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  which resulted in an allocation of million to purchased product rights  goodwill and other purchased intangibles 
also  in connection with this acquisition  an appraisal was done of the intangible assets  resulting in million of the purchase price being allocated to in process research and development that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
this in process research and development was expensed in amortization of goodwill and other purchased intangibles of million and million were expensed in and  respectively 
no amortization of these assets has been recorded in  due to the adoption of sfas no 
amortization of purchased product rights of million  million and million were expensed in  and  respectively 
in addition  we recorded goodwill amortization of  and  in and  respectively  with respect to goodwill recorded as a result of the acquisition of r in no amortization of this asset has been recorded since the goodwill was determined to be fully impaired when assessed in june in general  total amortization expense related to goodwill  purchased product rights and other purchased intangibles that resulted from the above noted acquisitions decreased in  compared to the prior years  due to the impairment of goodwill  purchased product rights and other purchased intangibles recorded in june  as well as the adoption of sfas no 
as of january restructuring and other special non recurring charges on june   we announced a board approved restructuring program to refocus on the most significant market opportunities and to reduce operating costs due to the macroeconomic factors that are negatively affecting technology investment in the market 
the restructuring program included a workforce reduction  consolidation of excess facilities  and discontinuance of non core products and programs 
as a result of the restructuring and other related special non recurring charges and the impact of the macroeconomic conditions on us and our global base of customers  we recognized restructuring and special non recurring charges of million in the second fiscal quarter of  with a subsequent increase of million in the second half of and a reduction of million in the first half of  as outlined below in millions

 workforce reduction and other personnel costs consolidation of excess facilities discontinuance of non core products and programs impairment of goodwill  purchased product rights and other purchased assets write down of long term strategic investments bad debt write offs and additional provisions to the allowance for doubtful accounts total an adjustment to reduce the accrued restructuring charges by million was made during the second quarter of to reflect savings realized as a result of the successful completion of certain contractual obligations in a cost effective manner 
as of june  we had initiated all actions required by the restructuring plan 
in addition  we recorded a million adjustment in the second quarter of to reflect a reduction in the accruals for special non recurring charges  related to the discontinuance of non core products and programs due to savings realized in completing contractual obligations offset by increased legal and other costs incurred to realize these savings 
no further adjustments were required in the following paragraphs provide information relating to the restructuring programs that resulted in the total special charges listed above 
workforce reduction and other personnel costs the restructuring program resulted in the reduction of approximately of our regular full time employees  or of the total workforce 
the reduction was across all major geographic locations  all business programs and all functions within the organization 
the reductions were more heavily weighted in sales and marketing  non core business programs such as entrust 
net and entrust yourservice and secondary geographies such as asia pacific and latin america 
the majority of the affected employees were notified of their termination in the second quarter of  and the workforce portion of the restructuring was largely completed by the end of the fourth quarter of we have recorded a cumulative workforce reduction charge of million primarily related to severance costs  fringe benefits due to severed employees and outplacement services 
other special non recurring charges included employee relocation expenses  hiring fees and signing bonuses totaling million on a cumulative basis  which were recorded primarily in general and administrative expenses 
consolidation of excess facilities we have recorded cumulative restructuring costs of million relating to the consolidation of excess facilities 
the consolidation of excess facilities included a total of eight offices in seven cities throughout the world 
the costs for consolidation of excess facilities were related primarily to non cancelable lease costs offset by estimated sublet recoveries 
the majority approximately of the costs were related to a  square foot facility in santa clara  california 
the santa clara facility costs are payable contractually over the 
table of contents remaining term of the lease  which runs through to we will continue to evaluate ongoing possibilities to settle this obligation in the most economic manner 
in addition to the cumulative million of restructuring costs related to excess facilities  an additional million of facilities related costs were recorded  on a cumulative basis  as a special non recurring charge as a result of impairment of leasehold improvements and other property and equipment that was disposed of or removed from operations as a result of the consolidation of excess facilities  and were included in the write down of leaseholds and other long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
these assets were identified as assets to be disposed of that would have no future benefit to us 
therefore  these assets were reported at the lower of carrying amount and fair value  less costs of disposition 
the majority of these costs are non cash charges 
discontinuance of non core products and programs in support of the restructuring objective to reduce costs and focus on our core technologies  we discontinued several non core products and programs 
the discontinued products and programs  totaling million on a cumulative basis  were primarily related to our services business initiatives and to certain desktop applications that did not achieve the growth and profitability targets in line with our core products and financial objectives 
the restructuring charge also included costs related to the exit of certain marketing events and programs that had been committed to prior to the restructuring  but which were being cancelled due to the change in corporate focus 
the cash outflow related to the majority of these items was substantially incurred by the end of the second quarter of fiscal accrued estimated marketing and distribution agreement obligations related to certain discontinued products of million are payable contractually through the discontinuance of products and programs  and expenses related to rebranding of our identity and our products  resulted in million of cumulative special non recurring charges  which was primarily recorded in sales and marketing expenses

table of contents impairment of goodwill  purchased product rights and other intangible purchased assets due to the decline in our market capitalization  the decline in current overall business conditions within our target market segments and the restructuring program  we completed an assessment of the recoverability of goodwill on our balance sheet as of june  in accordance with apb opinion no 
and the relevant guidance in sfas no 
this impairment analysis indicated that the carrying amount of the goodwill  purchased product rights and other purchased intangible assets of the encommerce and r acquisitions would not be recovered through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
we then completed an analysis of the discounted future cash flows from the encommerce acquisition and the r acquisition 
the result of this analysis was a charge of million related to the impairment of goodwill  purchased product rights and other purchased intangible assets 
goodwill  purchased product rights and other purchased intangibles from the encommerce acquisition accounted for million of the impairment 
this acquisition failed to meet the financial planning forecasts made at the time of the acquisition due largely to the change in the economic conditions since the time of the acquisition and in part due to additional product development and maintenance costs related to the getaccess product that were estimated to be required in the future and were not known at the time of the acquisition 
the remaining million of goodwill impairment in was the result of the r acquisition  which was impacted primarily by the workforce restructuring 
revenues from the encommerce products and services are estimated to have contributed approximately to of total revenues in and  but are estimated to have generated operating losses since acquisition 
the results of operations related to the r acquisition were not significant 
write down of long term strategic investments we assess the recoverability of the carrying value of our strategic investments on a regular basis 
factors that we consider important that could trigger impairment include  but are not limited to  the likelihood that the company in which we invested would have insufficient cash flows to operate for the next twelve months  significant changes in the company s operating performance or business model  and changes in overall market conditions 
we recorded charges related to other than temporary declines in the value of certain strategic investments of million in and million in we also recorded a gain on the disposition of a long term strategic investment of million in these investments are reviewed each period for possible impairment  and therefore  further adjustments may be required in the future 
bad debt write offs and additional provisions to the allowance for doubtful accounts due to the changes in the economic environment and the impact of the restructuring program  particularly the curtailment of certain products and presence in certain geographies  we recorded bad debt write offs and additional provisions to the allowance for doubtful accounts totaling million in  which was recorded primarily in sales and marketing expenses 
no additional provisions to the allowance for doubtful accounts were recorded in interest income interest income decreased to million in from million in and million in  representing  and of total revenues in the respective years 
the decrease in investment income for and  compared to the preceding year  reflected the reduced balance of funds invested  as these amounts have been drawn down to fund cash flow from operations and to acquire long lived assets and long term strategic investments 
in addition  the decrease was due to the lower interest rates that have been available in and  compared to the preceding years 
loss from equity investment we recorded  of losses related to our investment in entrust japan in  which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock  since we have the potential to 
table of contents significantly influence the operations and management of entrust japan 
these losses represent our share of the operating losses of entrust japan for  based on an approximate and ownership interest in the voting capital of entrust japan in the first and remaining quarters of  respectively 
we have included our share of post acquisition losses of entrust japan on the step by step acquisition method in our consolidated losses for  and accordingly  have included our share of entrust japan s first quarter operating losses  in addition to our share of their second  third and fourth quarter losses  in our operating results 
in addition  we have made a retroactive adjustment to consolidated accumulated deficit to record our share of the post acquisition losses of entrust japan of prior years  attributable to the less than ownership prior to the increased investment  to the extent of our previous investment of  provision for income taxes we recorded an income tax provision of million in  compared to million in and million in these provisions represent primarily the taxes payable in certain foreign jurisdictions 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
the effective income tax rates differed from statutory rates primarily due to the non deductibility of in process research and development  amortization and impairment of goodwill  purchased product rights and other purchased intangible assets  as well as an adjustment of the valuation allowance that has offset substantially the tax benefits from the significant net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards available 
quarterly results of operations our quarterly operating results have varied substantially in the past and are likely to vary substantially from quarter to quarter in the future due to a variety of factors 
in particular  our period to period operating results are significantly dependent upon the completion date of large license agreements 
in this regard  the purchase of our products often requires a significant capital investment  which customers may view as a discretionary cost and  therefore  a purchase that can be deferred or canceled due to budgetary or other business reasons 
estimating future revenues is also difficult because we ship our products soon after an order is received and  therefore  we do not have a significant backlog 
thus  quarterly license revenues are heavily dependent upon orders received and shipped within the same quarter 
moreover  we have generally recorded a significant portion of our total quarterly revenues in the third month of a quarter  with a concentration of these revenues in the last half of that third month 
this concentration of revenues is influenced by customer tendencies to make significant capital expenditures at the end of a fiscal quarter 
we expect these revenue patterns to continue for the foreseeable future 
in addition  quarterly license revenues are dependent on the timing of revenue recognition  which can be affected by many factors  including the timing of customer installations and acceptance 
in these regards  we have from time to time experienced delays in recognizing revenues with respect to certain orders 
in any period a significant portion of our revenue may be derived from large sales to a limited number of customers 
despite the uncertainties in our revenue patterns  our operating expenses are based upon anticipated revenue levels and such expenses are incurred on an approximately ratable basis throughout the quarter 
as a result  if expected revenues are delayed or otherwise not realized in a quarter for any reason  our business  operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected in a significant way 
under our restructuring program in  as discussed earlier  the levels of operating expenses decreased and the net loss decreased in the third and fourth quarters of and throughout the following tables set forth certain unaudited consolidated quarterly statement of operations data for the eight quarters in the two year period ended december   as well as such data expressed as a percentage of our total revenues for the periods indicated 
these data have been derived from unaudited consolidated financial statements that  in our opinion  include all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation of such information when read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report

our average days sales outstanding at december  was days  which represents an increase from the days that we reported at december  the overall increase in days sales outstanding from december  was mainly due to the decrease in allowance for doubtful accounts from the previous year and a slightly worse linearity of revenues during the last quarter of for purposes of calculating average 
table of contents days sales outstanding  we divide ending accounts receivable by the current quarter s revenues and multiply this amount by days 
the level of accounts receivable at each quarter end will be affected by the concentration of revenues in the final weeks of each quarter and may be negatively affected by expanded international revenues in relation to total revenues as licenses to international customers often have longer payment terms 
during  we generated million of cash in investing activities  primarily due to cash provided by reductions in our marketable investments in the amount of million net of million of marketable investment purchases 
this was partially offset by million invested in property and equipment primarily for computer hardware  furniture and leasehold improvements required to complete the fit up of our new addison  texas facility  million invested in entrust japan and million invested in other long term assets 
we used cash of million for financing activities in primarily for the repurchase of our common stock  offset by cash provided by the exercise of employee stock options and the sale of shares under our employee stock purchase plan 
for disclosure regarding our contractual obligations and commercial commitments  please see notes and to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
there were no new significant contractual obligations or commitments incurred in for information on related party transactions  please see note to our consolidated financial statements 
as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments in the amount of million provided our principal sources of liquidity 
overall  we used million from our cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments in although we are targeting operating breakeven  based on top line revenue growth while maintaining the current operating expense structure  we estimate that we will continue to use cash throughout our fiscal to fund operating losses and to satisfy the obligations accrued for under our restructuring program 
however  if revenue improvements do not materialize  then cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments will be negatively affected 
in addition  we announced in the third quarter of that we intend to repurchase up to an aggregate of  shares of our common stock over the month period ending july   or an earlier date determined by our board of directors  in open market  negotiated and block transactions 
the timing and amount of shares repurchased under this program will be determined by our management based on its evaluation of market and business conditions  and will be funded using available working capital 
during  we repurchased  shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of million 
while there can be no assurance as to the extent of usage of liquid resources in future periods  we believe that our cash flows from operations and existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments will be sufficient to meet our needs for at least the next twelve months 
certain factors that may affect our business our quarterly revenues and operating results are subject to significant fluctuations and such fluctuations may lead to a reduced market price for our stock 
our quarterly revenues and operating results have varied in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful  but securities analysts and investors often rely upon these comparisons as indicators of future performance 
if our operating results in any future period fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  or the guidance that we provide  the market price of our securities would likely decline 
factors that have caused our results to fluctuate in the past and which are likely to affect us in the future include the following reduced capital expenditures for software  length of sales cycles associated with our product offerings  
table of contents the timing  size and nature of our licensing transactions  the increased dependency on partners for end user fulfillment  market acceptance of new products or product enhancements by us  market acceptance of new products or product enhancements by our competitors  the relative proportions of revenues derived from licenses and services and maintenance  the timing of new personnel hires and the rate at which new personnel become productive  changes in pricing policies by our competitors  changes in our operating expenses  and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
estimating future revenues is difficult  and our failure to do so accurately may lead to a reduced market price for our stock and reduced profitability 
estimating future revenues is difficult because we ship our products soon after an order is received and  as such  we do not have a significant order backlog 
thus  quarterly license revenues depend heavily upon orders received and shipped within the same quarter 
moreover  we historically have recorded to of our total quarterly revenues in the third month of the quarter  with a concentration of revenues in the second half of that month 
we expect that this concentration of revenues  which is attributable in part to the tendency of some customers to make significant capital expenditures at the end of a fiscal quarter and to sales patterns within the software industry  will continue for the foreseeable future 
our expense levels are based  in significant part  upon our expectations as to future revenues and are largely fixed in the short term 
we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected shortfall in revenues 
any significant shortfall in revenues in relation to our expectations could have an immediate and significant effect on our profitability for that quarter and may lead to a reduced market price for our stock 
because of the lengthy and unpredictable sales cycle associated with our large software transactions  we may not succeed in closing transactions on a timely basis or at all  which would adversely affect our revenues and operating results 
transactions for our solutions often involve large expenditures  and the sales cycles for these transactions are often lengthy and unpredictable 
factors affecting the sales cycle include customers budgetary constraints  the timing of customers budget cycles  and customers internal approval processes 
we may not succeed in closing such large transactions on a timely basis or at all  which could cause significant variability in our revenues and results of operations for any particular period 
if our results of operations and cash flows fall below the expectations of securities analysts  or below the targeted guidance range that we have provided  our stock price may decline 
a limited number of customers has accounted for a significant percentage of our revenues  which may decline if we cannot maintain or replace these customer relationships 
historically  a limited number of customers has accounted for a significant percentage of our revenues 
in  and  our three largest customers accounted for  and of revenues  respectively 

table of contents we anticipate that our results of operations in any given period will continue to depend to a significant extent upon revenues from a small number of large customers 
in addition  we anticipate that such customers will continue to vary over time  so that the achievement of our long term goals will require us to obtain additional significant customers on an ongoing basis 
our failure to enter into a sufficient number of large licensing agreements during a particular period could have a material adverse effect on our revenues 
the us and canadian federal governments account for a significant percentage of our revenues  which may decline or be subject to delays  which would adversely affect our operating results 
the extended government vertical governments  including healthcare accounted for of our software revenue in sustaining and growing revenues in the government market will depend  in large part  on the following the adoption rate of our products within government departments and agencies  the timing and amount of budget appropriations for information technology and specifically information security  the timing of adoption of information security policies and regulations  including  but not limited to hippa and the gramm leach bliley act  and our ability to develop and maintain the appropriate business relationships with partners with whom the government contracts with for information security projects 
a decline  or delay in the growth of this market could reduce demand for our products  adversely affecting our revenues and results of operations 
the outbreak of war  significant threat of war  or a terrorist act could adversely affect our business 
historically  the outbreak of war has had an adverse affect upon the economy 
in the event of war or significant terrorist act  any of the following may occur government spending could be reprioritized to wartime activities 
the extended government vertical governments  including healthcare accounted for of our software revenue in  global enterprise spending budgets could be cut or delayed resulting in lower demand for our products  or widespread and unprecedented acts of cyber terrorism could cause disruption of communications and technology infrastructures  which could impact our customers of products and could have unforeseen economic impacts 
a decline or delay in economic spending due to the outbreak of war  significant threat of war or a terrorist act could reduce demand for our products  materially adversely affecting our revenues and results of operations 
if the enterprise information technology budgets and the digital identity security market do not continue to grow  demand for our products and services will be adversely affected 
the market for digital identity security solutions is at an early stage of development 
continued growth of the digital identity security market will depend  in large part  on the following the continued expansion of internet usage and the number of organizations adopting or expanding intranets and extranets  the rate of adoption of internet based business applications such as web services  
table of contents the ability of network infrastructures to support an increasing number of users and services  the public recognition of the potential threat posed by computer hackers and other unauthorized users  and the continued development of new and improved services for implementation across the internet  intranets and extranets 
a decline in the growth of this market could reduce demand for our products  adversely affecting our revenues and results of operations 
a breach of security at one of our customers  whether or not due to our products  could harm our reputation and reduce the demand for our products 
the processes used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks and intranets are rapidly evolving 
a well publicized actual or perceived breach of network or computer security at one of our customers  regardless of whether such breach is attributable to our products  third party technology used within our products or any significant advance in techniques for decoding or cracking encrypted information  could adversely affect the market s perception of us and our products  and could have an adverse effect on our reputation and the demand for our products 
in addition  the security level of our products is dependent upon the processes and procedures used to install and operate our products 
failure on the part of our customers to properly install and operate our products  could cause a security breach  which could adversely affect the market s perception of us and our products  and could have an adverse effect on our reputation and the demand for our products 
as our products contain errors or bugs  sales of our products would likely decline if some of these bugs or the number of bugs were significant 
like virtually all software systems  our products contain errors  failures or bugs that our existing testing procedures have not detected 
the errors may become evident at any time during the life of our products 
the discovery of any errors  failures or bugs in any products  including third party technology incorporated into our products  may result in adverse publicity  product returns  the loss or delay of market acceptance of our products  and third party claims against us 
accordingly  the discovery of any errors  failures or bugs would have a significant adverse effect on the sales of our products and our results of operations 
our revenues may decline if we cannot compete successfully in an intensely competitive market 
we target our products at the rapidly evolving market for digital identity security solutions 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger installed bases and significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and sales resources than we do 
as a result  they may be able to react more quickly to emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements  or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products 
in addition  certain of our current competitors in particular segments of the security marketplace may in the future broaden or enhance their offerings to provide a more comprehensive solution competing more fully with our functionality 

table of contents increased competition and increased market volatility in our industry could result in lower prices  reduced margins or the failure of our products and services to achieve or maintain market acceptance  any of which could have a serious adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business will not be successful if we do not keep up with the rapid changes in our industry 
the emerging market for digital identity security products and related services is characterized by rapid technological developments  frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards 
to be competitive  we have to continually improve the performance  features and reliability of our products and services  particularly in response to competitive offerings  and be first to market with new products and services or enhancements to existing products and services 
our failure to develop and introduce new products and services successfully on a timely basis and to achieve market acceptance for such products and services could have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may have difficulty managing our operations  which could adversely affect our ability to successfully grow our business 
our ability to manage future growth  if any  will depend upon our ability to continue to implement and improve operational  financial and management information systems on a timely basis  and expand  train  motivate and manage our work force 
our personnel  systems  procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our operations 
the geographic dispersal of our operations  including the separation of our headquarters in addison  texas  from our research and development facilities in ottawa  canada  and santa clara  california and from our european headquarters in reading  united kingdom  may make it more difficult to manage our growth 
if we fail to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel  our business may be harmed 
our future success depends upon our ability to continue to attract and retain highly qualified scientific  technical  sales and managerial personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  particularly in the field of cryptography  and there can be no assurance that we can retain our key scientific  technical  sales and managerial employees or that we can attract  motivate or retain other highly qualified personnel in the future 
if we cannot retain or are unable to hire such key personnel  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be significantly adversely affected 
we face risks associated with our international operations  which  if not managed properly  could have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in the future  we may establish additional foreign operations  hire additional personnel and establish relationships with additional partners internationally 
this expansion would require significant management attention and financial resources and could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
although our international sales currently are primarily denominated in us dollars  we may increasingly denominate sales in foreign currencies in the future 
in addition  our international business may be subject to the following risks difficulties in collecting international accounts receivable  difficulties in obtaining us export licenses  especially for products containing encryption technology  potentially longer payment cycles for customer payments  increased costs associated with maintaining international marketing efforts  
table of contents introduction of non tariff barriers and higher duty rates  difficulties in enforcement of contractual obligations and intellectual property rights  difficulties managing personnel and operations in remote locations  and increased complexity in global corporate tax structure 
any one of these could significantly and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if the laws regarding exports of our products further limit or otherwise restrict our business  we could be prohibited from shipping our products to restricted countries  which would result in a loss of revenues 
some of our products are subject to export controls under laws of the us  canada and other countries 
the list of products and countries for which exports are restricted  and the relevant regulatory policies  are likely to be revised from time to time 
if we cannot obtain required government approvals under these regulations  we may not be able to sell products abroad or make products available for sale internationally via computer networks such as the internet 
furthermore  us governmental controls on the exportation of encryption products and technology may in the future restrict our ability to freely export some of our products with the most powerful information security encryption technology 
we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights  which could make us less competitive and cause us to lose market share 
our future success will depend  in part  upon our intellectual property rights and our ability to protect these rights 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  nondisclosure agreements  shrink wrap licenses and other contractual provisions to establish  maintain and protect our proprietary rights 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized third parties may copy aspects of our products  obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary  or infringe upon our patents 
policing piracy and other unauthorized use of our products is difficult  particularly in international markets and as a result of the growing use of the internet 
in addition  third parties might successfully design around our patents or obtain patents that we would need to license or design around 
finally  the protections we have obtained may not be sufficient because some courts have held that shrink wrap licenses  because they are not signed by the licensee  are not enforceable  our trade secrets  confidentiality agreements and patents may not provide meaningful protection of our proprietary information  and we may not seek additional patents on our technology or products and such patents  even if obtained  may not be broad enough to protect our technology or products 
our inability or failure to protect our proprietary rights could have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we have been subject to  and may in the future become subject to  intellectual property infringement claims that could be costly and could result in a diversion of management s attention 
as the number of security products in the industry and the functionality of these products further overlaps  software developers and publishers may increasingly become subject to claims of infringement or 
table of contents misappropriation of the intellectual property or proprietary rights of others 
from time to time  we have received notices from third parties either soliciting our interest in obtaining a license under one or more patents owned or licensed by these third parties or suggesting that our products may be infringing one or more patents owned or licensed by these third parties 
from time to time  we have received notices from various customers stating that we may be responsible for indemnifying such customers pursuant to indemnification obligations in product license agreements with such customers for alleged infringement of patents assigned to a third parties 
to date  we are not aware that any customer has filed an action against us for indemnification 
in addition  third parties may assert infringement or misappropriation claims against us in the future 
defending or enforcing our intellectual property could be costly and could result in a diversion of management s attention  which could have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
a successful claim against us could also have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations for the period in which damages are paid 
additionally  as a result of a successful claim  we could potentially be enjoined from using technology that is required for our products to remain competitive which could in turn have an adverse effect on our results of operations for subsequent periods 
we may lose access to technology that we license from outside vendors  which loss could adversely affect our ability to sell our products 
we rely on outside licensors for patent and or software license rights in technology that is incorporated into and is necessary for the operation of our products 
for example  our ability to provide web server certificates in the future is dependent upon a licensing agreement we have with baltimore technologies  one of our primary competitors 
our success will depend in part on our continued ability to have access to such technologies that are or may become important to the functionality of our products 
any inability to continue to procure or use such technology could have a significant adverse effect on our ability to sell some of our products 
we have entered into complex contracts  which require on going monitoring and administration 
failure to monitor and administer these contracts properly may result in liability or damages 
we enter into complex contractual agreements with our customers  suppliers and partners 
some of these contracts contain clauses  which if not properly monitored and administered may be breached  and result in damages 
these damages could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
future acquisitions or investments could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees  increase our expenses and adversely affect our results of operations 
it is possible  as part of our future growth strategy  that we will from time to time acquire or make investments in companies  technologies  product solutions or professional services offerings 
with respect to these acquisitions  we would face the difficulties of assimilating personnel and operations from the acquired businesses and the problems of retaining and motivating key personnel from such businesses 
in addition  these acquisitions may disrupt our ongoing operations  divert management from day to day business  increase our expenses and adversely impact our results of operations 
any future acquisitions would involve certain other risks  including the assumption of additional liabilities  potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and incurrence of debt 
in addition  these types of transactions often result in charges to earnings for such items as amortization of goodwill or in process research and development expenses 
our stock price is volatile and may continue to be volatile in the future 
the trading price of our common stock has been  and is expected to continue to be  highly volatile and may be significantly and adversely affected by factors such as actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results  announcements of technological innovations  
table of contents new products or new contracts by us or our competitors  developments with respect to patents  copyrights or propriety rights  conditions and trends in the security industry  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  and general market conditions and other factors 
nortel networks ownership of approximately of our voting stock could have the effect of impeding a change of control  and the sale of shares of entrust common stock held by nortel networks could negatively impact our share price 
as of december   nortel networks limited  through its subsidiary  nortel networks inc  beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding voting stock 
this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control that other stockholders may find favorable 
nortel networks also has the right to sell its shares under rule of the securities act of or through the exercise of demand registration rights 
nortel networks decisions to sell its shares could negatively affect our share price 
provisions of our charter and bylaws may delay or prevent transactions that are in your best interests 
our charter and bylaws contain provisions  including a staggered board of directors that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us  or may discourage bids to do so 
these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock and could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or could discourage a third party from acquiring  a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
our board of directors also has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or may discourage a third party from acquiring  a majority of our outstanding voting stock

some of these investments are subject to interest rate risk  whereby a change in market interest rates will cause the principal amount of the underlying investment to fluctuate 
therefore  depreciation in principal value of an investment is possible in situations where the investment is made at a fixed interest rate and the market interest rate then subsequently increases 
we try to manage this risk by maintaining our cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments with high quality financial institutions and investment managers 
we also restrict the investments to primarily securities with short term maturities  such that  at december   the majority of our marketable investments had maturities of less than twelve months from that date 
as a result  we believe that our exposure to market risk related to interest rates is minimal 
the following table presents the cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments that we held at december  and  that would have been subject to interest rate risk  and the related ranges of maturities as of those dates december  december  maturity maturity within months months months months within months months months months in thousands investments classified as cash and cash equivalents investments classified as held to maturity marketable investments total amortized cost fair value risk associated with exchange rates we are subject to foreign exchange risk as a result of exposures to changes in currency exchange rates  specifically between the united states and canada  the united kingdom  and the european union 
however  this exposure is not considered to be material due to the fact that the united kingdom and european operations are not significant  and the canadian operations are naturally hedged against exchange rate fluctuations since both revenues and expenses are denominated in canadian dollars 
therefore  an unfavorable change in the exchange rate for the canadian subsidiary would result in lower revenues when translated into us dollars  but the expenses would be lowered in a corresponding fashion 
as a result  we do not engage in formal hedging activities  but we do periodically review the potential impact of this risk to ensure that the risk of significant potential losses remains minimal 
risk associated with equity investments we have invested in several privately held companies  most of which are technology companies in the start up or development stage  or are companies with technologies and products that are targeted at geographically distant markets 
if the demand for the technologies and products offered by these privately held companies materializes slowly  to a minimum extent  or not at all in the relevant markets  we could lose all or substantially all of our investments in these companies 
to date  we have recorded losses of million from impairments 
table of contents and a realized gain of million from dispositions in connection with these investments 
we recorded million of these impairments in on april   we increased our investment in the voting capital of entrust japan from an ownership share of less than to approximately by converting a previous cash advance of  and by exchanging cash of approximately  entrust software product valued at approximately million and distribution rights for certain entrust products for the japanese market  for additional shares in entrust japan 
our increased investment followed additional investments made by toyota and secom in the fourth quarter of we believe that because of our additional investment  as of the second quarter of  we have the potential ability to exercise significant influence over the operations of entrust japan 
therefore  in the second quarter of  we began accounting for this investment in entrust japan under the equity method  in accordance with the provisions of apb no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock and arb no 
 consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  on the step by step acquisition method  we recorded a retroactive adjustment to consolidated accumulated deficit to record our share of the post acquisition losses of entrust japan of prior years of  as required by this accounting guidance 
this retroactive adjustment is attributable to our pro rata share of losses recorded by entrust japan during the period in which we owned less than of their voting stock  to the extent of our previous investment 
in addition  we recorded our share of post acquisition losses of entrust japan  in the amount of  in our consolidated losses for these losses are attributable to our pro rata share of entrust japan s losses in  while we had an equity ownership of approximately of their voting stock 
during  entrust japan exceeded the performance targets established at the date of increased investment 
however  due to entrust japan s history of operating losses  it is possible that all or substantially all of the remaining million equity investment in entrust japan at december  may be expensed through our operating earnings in future quarters as a result of our recognition of our equity share of losses in entrust japan 
as of december   we believe that there had not been an impairment of our investment in entrust japan 
however  there are risks associated with joint venture investments  including failure to agree on budgets  market plans  staffing decisions and changes in strategic direction by one of the partners 
if any one of these risks occurred  the value of our investment could be adversely affected
