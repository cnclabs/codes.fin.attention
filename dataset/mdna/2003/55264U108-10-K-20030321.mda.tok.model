item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the information set forth under general in item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing under item of this report 
general we had net income of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
part of the increase is due to million in merger expenses  net of related tax benefits  incurred in the period 
net income excluding merger expenses increased by million  or to million in from million in fully diluted earnings per share for the year ended december  was per share compared to per share for the profitability of our operations depends primarily on our net interest income  which is the difference between total interest earned on interest earning assets and total interest paid on interest bearing liabilities 
our net income is affected by our provision for loan losses as well as other income and other expenses 
the provision for loan losses reflects the amount that we believe is adequate to cover probable credit losses in the loan portfolio 
non interest income or other income consists of loan service fees  deposit service fees  net lease financing income  trust and brokerage fees  net gains losses on the sale of securities available for sale  increase in cash surrender value of life insurance and other operating income 
other expenses include salaries and employee benefits along with occupancy and equipment expense  computer services expense  advertising and marketing expense  professional and legal  intangibles amortization expense and other operating expenses including merger expenses 
net interest income is affected by changes in the volume and mix of interest earning assets  the level of interest rates earned on those assets  the volume and mix of interest bearing liabilities and the level of interest rates paid on those interest bearing liabilities 
the provision for loan losses is dependent on changes in the loan portfolio and management s assessment of the collectibility of the loan portfolio  as well as economic and market conditions 
other income and other expenses are impacted by growth of operations and growth in the number of accounts through both acquisitions and core banking business growth 
growth in operations affects other expenses as a result of additional employees  branch facilities and promotional marketing expense 
growth in the number of accounts affects other income  including service fees as well as other expenses such as computer services  supplies  postage  telecommunications and other miscellaneous expenses 
net interest income the following table presents  for the periods indicated  the total dollar amount of interest income from average interest earning assets and the related yields  as well as the interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities  and the related costs  expressed both in dollars and rates dollars in thousands year ended december  average balance interest yield rate average balance interest yield rate average balance interest yield rate interest earning assets loans loans exempt from taxes taxable investment securities investment securities exempt from federal income taxes federal funds sold other interest bearing deposits total interest earning assets non interest earning assets total assets interest bearing liabilities deposits now and money market deposit savings deposit time deposits short term borrowings long term borrowings total interest bearing liabilities non interest bearing deposits other non interest bearing liabilities stockholders equity total liabilities and stockholders equity net interest income interest rate spread net interest margin on a fully tax equivalent basis net interest margin non accrual loans are included in average loans 
interest income includes loan origination fees of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
non taxable loan and investment income is presented on a fully tax equivalent basis assuming a tax rate 
interest rate spread represents the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities and is presented on a fully tax equivalent basis 
net interest margin represents net interest income as a percentage of average interest earning assets 
our net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis increased million  or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis decreased million due to a basis point decline in yield on average interest earning assets to 
the decrease in yield was partially offset by a million  or increase in average earning assets  comprised of a million  or increase in average loans  a million  or decline in federal funds sold and a million  or decline in average investment securities 
interest expense declined by million due to a basis point decrease in the cost of funds to  which was partially offset by a million  or increase in average interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest margin expressed on a fully tax equivalent basis rose basis points to in the year ended december  from in due to better pricing obtained by us on loans and deposits in a declining rate environment during for the year ended december   net interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis increased million to million from million for the year ended december  the increase in net interest income resulted from a decrease in interest expense of million  or  which exceeded the thousand  or  decline in interest income on a fully tax equivalent basis 
interest income decreased due to a basis point decline in fully tax equivalent yield on average earning assets to 
the decrease in yield was partially offset by a million  or  increase in average interest earning assets  comprised of a million  or  increase in average loans offset by a million  or  decline in average total investment securities 
interest expense declined due to a basis point decline in the cost of funds to  which was partially offset by a million  or  increase in average interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest margin expressed on a fully tax equivalent basis declined by two basis points to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  volume and rate analysis of net interest income the following table presents the extent to which changes in volume and interest rates of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have affected our interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated 
information is provided in each category with respect to i changes attributable to changes in volume changes in volume multiplied by prior period rate  ii changes attributable to changes in rates changes in rates multiplied by prior period volume and iii change attributable to a combination of changes in rate and volume change in rates multiplied by the changes in volume in thousands 
changes attributable to the combined impact of volume and rate have been allocated proportionately to the changes due to volume and the changes due to rate 
year ended december  compared to compared to change due to volume change due to rate total change change due to volume change due to rate total change interest earning assets loans loans exempt from federal income taxes taxable investment securities investment securities exempt from federal income taxes federal funds sold other interest bearing deposits total increase decrease in interest income interest bearing liabilities now and money market deposit accounts savings deposits time deposits short term borrowings long term borrowings total increase decrease in interest expense increase in net interest income non taxable loan and investment income is presented on a fully tax equivalent basis assuming a rate for the year ended december  and december   respectively 
other income other income increased million  or to million for the year ended december  from million in net lease financing increased by million  primarily due to million in additional revenues generated as a result of the lasalle acquisition and a thousand increase in net lease gains for the year ended december  compared to deposit service fees increased by million  primarily due to increases in monthly service charges and nsf and overdraft fees of million and thousand  respectively 
other operating income grew by million  largely due to thousand in gains on the origination and sale of residential mortgage loans in the period and increases in gain on sale of other real estate and atm fees of thousand and thousand  respectively 
increase in cash surrender value of life insurance grew by million due to the additional million invested in january trust and brokerage fees increased by million due to increases in income from trust services and investment services income of million and thousand  respectively 
other income increased million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  loan service fees increased by million due to greater volumes and higher income realized on interest only securities 
net gains on available for sale securities increased by million in as none were realized during deposit service fees grew million to million due to increased volumes of monthly service charges and overdraft and non sufficient funds fees 
trust and brokerage fees grew by thousand  or due to increased commissions on investment products 
increase in cash surrender value of life insurance grew by thousand while other operating income declined by million primarily due to lower gains on sale of other real estate owned 
other expenses other expense decreased by million  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  due to million in merger expenses incurred in the period 
excluding merger expenses recorded in  other expense increased by million  or 
within the category  salaries and employee benefits increased by million due to the lincolnwood and lasalle acquisitions and our continued growth and investment in personnel 
computer services increased by million due to the outsourcing of processing activities and the addition of lincolnwood 
professional and legal expense increased by million  largely due to a million accrual in for an unfavorable appellate court ruling related to rent payments claimed to be owed by us pursuant to a land lease agreement under which we are lessee 
during the first quarter of  the appellate court reversed the decision of a lower court  which had found that we were not liable for these payments under the lease agreement and had directed summary judgement in our favor 
in october  the illinois supreme court denied our petition for leave to appeal the appellate court ruling  effectively eliminating the possibility that this ruling will be reversed 
in february  the circuit court denied hearing our counterclaim  thereby foreclosing our opportunities at the lower court level 
we await a status hearing for consideration of the attorneys fees and rent calculation issues 
the accrual reflects the amount pertaining to rent expense incurred through december  goodwill amortization expense declined by million  or basic and fully diluted earnings per share  due to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
occupancy and equipment expenses declined by million due to a reduction in depreciation expense partially resulting from the outsourcing of the data processing activities during december for the year ended december   other expenses increased by million to million from million in merger expenses incurred in fourth quarter of million account for most of this increase 
salaries and employee benefits grew by million to million  from million in due to our continued investment in people and employees added through our may acquisition of fsl holdings  inc offsetting these increases were declines in other operating expense  occupancy and equipment expense and advertising and marketing expense of million  thousand and thousand  respectively 
income taxes income tax expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the effective tax rate decreased to for the year ended december  compared to in due to the non deductibility of certain merger costs and the valuation reserve established in the fourth quarter of for state net operating loss carryforwards 
income tax expense for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the effective tax rate increased to for the year ended december   from in due to the non deductibility of certain merger costs and uncertainty relative to the realization of state net operating loss carryforwards 
see note of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for our income tax accounting policy 
income tax expense recorded in the consolidated income statement involves interpretation and application of certain accounting pronouncements and federal and state tax codes  and is  therefore  considered a critical accounting policy 
we undergo examination by various regulatory taxing authorities 
such agencies may require that changes in the amount of tax expense or valuation allowance be recognized when their interpretations differ from those of management  based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations 
see note of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for more income tax information 
balance sheet total assets increased million  or to billion at december  from billion at december  net loans increased by million  or largely due to the acquisition of lincolnwood  which had net loans of million at the april  acquisition date  as well as continued growth in our loan portfolio 
investment securities available for sale increased by million  or primarily due to the acquisition of lincolnwood  which had investment securities available for sale of million at the acquisition date 
cash surrender value of life insurance increased by million  or due to an additional investment of million made in january net lease investments increased by million  or due to the lasalle acquisition  while goodwill increased by million due to goodwill generated in the lincolnwood and lasalle acquisitions 
total liabilities increased by million  or to billion at december  from billion at december  total deposits grew by million  or largely due to million in deposits assumed by us in the acquisition of lincolnwood 
company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities increased by million due to trust preferred securities issued in august long term borrowings increased by million  or primarily due to million of notes payable added through the lasalle acquisition 
short term borrowings declined by million  or due to million in repayments of federal home loan bank advances  which were partially offset by additional federal funds purchased of million 
total stockholders equity increased million  or to million at december  compared to million at december  the growth was primarily due to net income in  a million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income  and the issuance of million in additional common stock in conjunction with the acquisition of lasalle 
these items were partially offset by million  or per share cash dividends paid during investment securities the primary purpose of the investment portfolio is to provide a source of earnings for liquidity management purposes  and to control interest rate risk 
in managing the portfolio  we seek safety of principal  liquidity  diversification and maximized return on funds

the following table sets forth the amortized cost and fair value of investment securities  by type of security as indicated in thousands at december  at december  amortized cost fair value amortized cost fair value securities available for sale us treasury securities us government agencies states and political subdivisions mortgage backed securities corporate bonds equity securities debt securities issued by foreign governments investment in equity lines of credit trusts total securities available for sale us treasury securities and securities of us government agencies generally consist of fixed rate securities with maturities of three months to three years 
states and political subdivisions investment securities consist of investment grade and local non rated issues with maturities of less than five years 
the average term of mortgage backed securities generally ranges between five and ten years  however  certain mortgage backed securities include maturities longer than ten years 
some corporate bonds have terms of five to ten years or longer 
investment securities held to maturity declined by million as of december   as our held to maturity portfolio was reclassified as available for sale during upon the implementation of sfas no 
the fair value of such investment securities was million as of the transfer date 
there were no securities of any single issuer  other than us government agencies and mortgage backed securities  which had a book value in excess of of our stockholders equity at december  the following table sets forth certain information regarding contractual maturities and the weighted average yields of our securities portfolio at december  dollars in thousands due in one year or less due after one year through five years due after five years through ten years due after ten years balance weighted average yield balance weighted average yield balance weighted average yield balance weighted average yield us treasury securities us government agencies states and political subdivision mortgage backed securities corporate bonds equity securities debt securities issued by foreign governments investments in equity lines of credit trusts total yield is reflected on a fully tax equivalent basis utilizing a tax rate 
these securities are presented based upon contractual maturities 
loan portfolio the following table sets forth the composition of our loan portfolio dollars in thousands at december  amount percent amount percent amount percent amount percent amount percent commercial commercial loans collateralized by assignment of lease payments commercial real estate residential real estate construction real estate installment and other gross loans allowance for loan losses net loans gross loan balances at december      and are net of unearned income  including net deferred loans fees of million  million  million  million  and million  respectively 
net loans increased by million  or to billion at december  from billion at december  the increase was largely due to the acquisition of lincolnwood  which had net loans of million at the acquisition date  as well as continued growth within our loan portfolio 
the increase in our portfolio in over was due primarily to growth in the commercial real estate portfolio and lease banking business and approximately million in loans acquired through the fsl acquisition of which million were subsequently sold 
increases in our loan portfolio for the years through were primarily due to internal loan growth as well as the avondale merger and damen financial corporation acquisition in loan maturities the following table sets forth the maturity or repricing information for commercial and construction real estate loans outstanding at december  in thousands due in one year or less due after one year through five years due after five years fixed rate floating rate fixed rate floating rate fixed rate floating rate total commercial loans  commercial loans collateralized by assignment of lease payments construction real estate loans asset quality the following table sets forth the amounts of non performing loans and non performing assets at the dates indicated dollars in thousands at december  non accruing loans loans days or more past due  still accruing interest total non performing loans other real estate owned other repossessed assets total non performing assets total non performing loans to total loans allowance for loan losses to non performing loans total non performing assets to total assets non performing loans non performing loans include loans accounted for on a non accrual basis  accruing loans contractually past due days or more as to interest and principal and loans whose terms have been renegotiated to provide reduction or deferral of interest or principal because of a deterioration in the financial position of the borrower 
management reviews the loan portfolio for problem loans on an ongoing basis 
during the ordinary course of business  management becomes aware of borrowers that may not be able to meet the contractual requirements of loan agreements 
these loans are placed under close supervision with consideration given to placing the loan on non accrual status  increasing the allowance for loan losses and if appropriate partial or full charge off 
after a loan is placed on non accrual status  any current year interest previously accrued but not yet collected is reversed against current income 
if interest payments are received on non accrual loans  these payments will be applied to principal and not taken into income 
loans will not be placed back on accrual status unless back interest and principal payments are made 
if interest on non accrual loans had been accrued  such income would have amounted to approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  none of these amounts were included in interest income during these periods 
our general policy is to place loans days past due on non accrual status 
non accrual loans are further classified as impaired when underlying collateral is not sufficient to cover the loan balance and it is probable that we will not fully collect all principal and interest 
non performing assets also consist of other repossessed assets and other real estate owned 
other real estate owned represents properties acquired through foreclosure or other proceedings and is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value less the estimated cost of disposal 
other real estate owned is evaluated regularly to ensure that the recorded amount is supported by its current fair value 
valuation allowances to reduce the carrying amount to fair value less estimated costs of disposal are recorded as necessary 
revenues and expenses from the operations of other real estate owned and changes in the valuation are included in other income and other expenses on the income statement 
at december   total non performing assets increased million to million from million at december  due to a million increase in non performing loans which was partially offset by declines in other real estate and other repossessed assets of thousand and thousand  respectively 
at december   non performing assets increased million to million from million at december  due to increases in non performing loans and other real estate of million and thousand  respectively and partially offset by a thousand decline in other repossessed assets 
allowance for loan losses management believes the allowance for loan losses accounting policy is critical to the portrayal and understanding of our financial condition and results of operations 
as such  selection and application of this critical accounting policy involves judgements  estimates  and uncertainties that are susceptible to change 
in the event that different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  and depending upon the severity of such changes  the possibility of materially different financial condition or results of operations is a reasonable likelihood 
we maintain our allowance for loan losses at a level that management believes will be adequate to absorb probable losses on existing loans based on an evaluation of the collectibility of loans and prior loss experience 
we use a risk rating system to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
with this system  each loan  with the exception of those included in large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans  is risk rated between one and nine  by the originating loan officer  senior credit management  loan review or any loan committee  with one being the best case and nine being a loss or the worst case 
loan loss reserve factors are multiplied against the balances in each risk rating category to determine an appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses 
loans with risk ratings between five and eight are monitored much closer by the officers 
control of our loan quality is continually monitored by management and is reviewed by our board of directors when they meet from time to time 
we consistently apply our methodology for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  but may adjust our methodologies and assumptions based on historical information related to charge offs and management s evaluation of the current loan portfolio 
the following table presents an analysis of the allowance for loan losses for the years presented dollars in thousands year ended december  balance at beginning of year decreases resulting from sale of subsidiary additions from acquisition purchase of loans provision for loan losses charge offs commercial commercial loans collateralized by assignment of lease payments commercial real estate residential real estate construction real estate installment and other total charge offs recoveries commercial commercial loans collateralized by assignment of lease payments commercial real estate residential real estate construction real estate installment and other total recoveries net charge offs balance at december  total loans at december  ratio of allowance to total loans ratio of net charge offs to average loans the company maintains its allowance for loan losses at a level that management believes will be adequate to absorb probable losses on existing loans based on an evaluation of the collectibility of loans  prior loss experience  and the value of underlying collateral 
net charge offs totaled million in  a decrease of million from million in in the second quarter of  we added million to the allowance with the acquisition of lincolnwood 
in the first quarter of  we added million of pooled home equity lines of credit to the loan portfolio through the purchase of a interest in our securitization trust and added million to the allowance for loan losses for these loans 
in the second quarter of  million was added to the allowance with the acquisition of fsl 
the provision for loan losses increased by million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in annual provision was primarily due to continued weakness in the overall economic environment and an increase in impaired loans during the following table sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan losses for the years presented and the percentage of loans in each category to total loans 
an allocation for a loan classification is only for internal analysis of the adequacy of the allowance and is not an indication of expected or anticipated losses dollars in thousands at december  amount percent amount percent amount percent amount percent amount percent commercial commercial loans collateralized by assignment of lease payments commercial and residential real estate construction real estate installment and other unallocated total additions to the allowance for loan losses  which are charged to earnings through the provision for loan losses  are determined based on a variety of factors  including specific reserves on problem loans  current loan risk ratings  delinquent loans  historical loss experience and economic conditions in our market area 
in addition  federal regulatory authorities  as part of the examination process  periodically review our allowance for loan losses 
the regulators may require us to record additions to the allowance level based upon their assessment of the information available to them at the time of examination 
although management believes the allowance for loan losses is sufficient to cover probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio  there can be no assurance that the allowance will prove sufficient to cover actual future loan losses 
potential problem loans we utilize an internal asset classification system as a means of reporting problem and potential problem assets 
at each scheduled meeting of the boards of directors of our subsidiary banks  a watch list is presented  showing significant loan relationships listed as special mention  substandard  and doubtful 
an asset is classified substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged  if any 
substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
assets classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full  on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions and values  highly questionable and improbable 
assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and viewed as non bankable assets and have been charged off 
assets that do not currently expose us to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories  but possess weaknesses that may or may not be within the control of the customer are deemed to be special mention 
our determination as to the classification of our assets and the amount of our valuation allowances is subject to review by the subsidiary banks primary regulators  which can order the establishment of additional general or specific loss allowances 
there can be no assurance that regulators  in reviewing our loan portfolio  will not request us to materially increase our allowance for loan losses 
the office of the comptroller of the currency  in conjunction with the other federal banking agencies  has adopted an interagency policy statement on the allowance for loan losses 
the policy statement provides guidance for financial institutions on both the responsibilities of management for the assessment and establishment of adequate allowances and guidance for banking agency examiners to use in determining the adequacy of general valuation guidelines 
generally  the policy statement recommends that institutions have effective systems and controls to identify  monitor and address asset quality problems  management has analyzed all significant factors that affect the collectibility of the portfolio in a reasonable manner  and management has established acceptable allowance evaluation processes that meet the objectives set forth in the policy statement 
management believes it has established an adequate allowance for probable loan losses 
we analyze our process regularly  with modifications made if needed  and reports those results four times per year at meetings of our board of directors 
however  there can be no assurance that regulators  in reviewing our loan portfolio  will not request us to materially increase our allowance for loan losses at the time 
although management believes that adequate specific and general loan loss allowances have been established  actual losses are dependent upon future events and  as such  further additions to the level of specific and general loan loss allowances may become necessary 
potential problem loans are loans included on the watch list presented to the boards of directors that do not meet the definition of a non performing loan  but where known information about possible credit problems of borrowers causes management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with present loan repayment terms 
the aggregate principal amounts of potential problem loans as of december  and december  were approximately million and million  respectively 
potential problem loans increased million in primarily due to continued weakness in the overall economic environment 
loans rated special mention contributed million to this increase 
as of december   we had approximately million in performing lease loans collectively kmart loans under which kmart corporation was the lessee 
approximately million of these loans were direct financing leases included in our lease loan portfolio 
kmart corporation filed for bankruptcy protection on january  the kmart loans are secured by revenue producing equipment with an original cost of million that was purchased and installed during the second half of after filing for bankruptcy protection  kmart corporation closed a number of its retail store locations  including some in which this equipment was located 
at that time  kmart had informed us that all of our equipment located in closed stores had been moved to stores that would remain open  but to our knowledge  kmart has not affirmed or rejected our leases in bankruptcy court 
on january   kmart announced  as part of its reorganization plan  that its board approved the closure of of its remaining  stores 
shortly thereafter  a bankruptcy court granted final approval for kmart to close stores 
nine of the stores announced for closure will remain open due to lease concessions and renegotiations 
it is unclear how the additional store closures will affect the use of our equipment or the performance of the related lease loans 
while the kmart loans are currently performing in accordance with their terms  no assurance can be given that this will continue to be the case and such performance may depend on the terms of a reorganization plan for kmart 
no assurances can be made that a loss related to these loans will not be incurred 
interest only receivables in  and  avondale federal savings bank which we purchased in securitized certain home equity lines of credit to investors with limited recourse  retaining the right to service the underlying loans 
the securitizations were done using qualified special purpose entities securitization trusts 
upon the sale  the net carrying amount of the loans were removed from the balance sheet  and certain retained residual interests were recorded 
the retained interests included rights to service the loans that were sold the servicing rights and the rights to future cash flows the interest only receivables arising after the investors in the securitization trusts received their contractual return 
in addition  we retained a security interest in the securitization trusts  reflecting the excess of the total amount of loans transferred to the trusts over the portion represented by certificates sold to investors 
through the avondale merger  we acquired servicing rights related to these loans 
we receive annual servicing fees that approximate of the outstanding loan balance 
the investors and their securitization trusts have no recourse to our other assets for failure of debtors to pay when due 
most of our retained interest in the securitization trusts is generally restricted until investors have been fully paid and is subordinate to investors interest 
the retained interest is included with securities available for sale and is reflected as investments in equity lines of credit trust 
we estimate the fair value of these securities by using prices paid for similar securities 
since the projected income from the servicing rights approximates our estimated cost to service the loans  no asset was recorded 
income from servicing is recognized as earned pursuant to the terms of the servicing agreement and to the extent cash collections from the borrowers exceed payments to the investors 
cash collections in excess of the servicing rights income that is earned is next applied to the interest only receivables 
the value allocated to the interest only receivables is reduced and interest income is recorded assuming a constant yield based upon the discount rate used to estimate its fair value 
at the end of the estimated life of the securitization  the carrying value of the interest only receivables will be fully amortized 
because our retained residual interests are subordinated to the interests of the securitization investors  there is risk that the carrying value of the interest only receivables will not be fully recovered  resulting in a loss charged to earnings 
in addition  since actual credit losses may exceed projected credit losses over the life of the securitization  there is a risk that the value of our retained participation interest will not be fully realized  resulting in a loss charged to earnings 
recourse against us for credit losses is limited to the amount of the sales proceeds that were not remitted by the securitization trust at the time of the initial sale of the loans 
at each reporting period  the fair value of the interest only receivables are re evaluated based upon current estimates and assumptions of the net present value of residual future cash flows net of remaining expected credit losses 
if this re evaluation results in fair values that are less than the amortized carrying value of the interest only receivables and if remaining projected cash flows are less than previously estimated  the carrying value is written down to fair value 
if the write down is determined to be other than temporary  the amount of the write down is charged against earnings for the current period 
finally  at each reporting period  new interest only receivable amortization schedules are revised based upon current estimates  assumptions  adjusted carrying values and revised constant yields 
judgements and assumptions that are most critical to the application of this accounting policy are estimated defaults  delinquencies and credit losses  projected prepayment speeds and discount rates 
these assumptions are based upon demonstrated credit and prepayment performance of the underlying loans 
these are  in turn  most highly influenced by general economic conditions  with the greatest adverse affect during economic downturns and periods of rapidly falling interest rates 
changes in assumptions and conditions could result in unexpected write downs of the residual interests as well as interest accruals and accretion that are less than historically experienced 
see also note of the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements 
at december   interest only receivables were million 
the value of interest only receivables is subject to substantial credit  prepayment  and interest rate risk on the transferred financial assets 
on a quarterly basis  we perform a review to determine the fair value of our interest only receivables  as these receivables are accounted for as investment securities available for sale 
as part of the review  we review our assumptions of prepayment speeds  discount rates and the remaining anticipated credit losses 
the following table shows the results of our assumptions used to estimate the fair value at december  dollars in thousands interest only receivables pools adjustable adjustable estimated fair value prepayment speed remaining weighted average life in years expected remaining credit losses residual cash flows discounted at loans outstanding at december  rates for these loans are adjusted based on the prime rate as published in the wall street journal 
unrealized holding gains at december  totaled thousand and million  for and  respectively 
the remaining weighted average life in years of prepayable assets is calculated by summing a the principal collections expected in each future year multiplied by b the number of years until collection  and then dividing that sum by the initial principal balance 
this is not explicitly assumed but it reflects the overall effect of prepayment assumptions 
assumed remaining credit losses over the life remaining on the loans outstanding at december  are thousand and million for and  respectively 
the estimated credit loss percentage is derived by dividing the remaining credit losses by the related loan balance outstanding in the pool 
sources of funds general 
deposits  short term and long term borrowings  including company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities  loan and investment security repayments and prepayments  proceeds from the sale of securities  and cash flows generated from operations are the primary sources of our funds for lending  investing  leasing and other general purposes 
loan repayments are a relatively predictable source of funds except during periods of significant interest rate declines  while deposit flows tend to fluctuate with prevailing interests rates  money markets conditions  general economic conditions and competition 
deposits 
we offer a variety of deposit accounts with a range of interest rates and terms 
our core deposits consist of checking accounts  now accounts  money market accounts  savings accounts and non public certificates of deposit 
these deposits  along with public fund deposits  brokered deposits  and short term and long term borrowings are used to support our asset base 
our deposits are obtained predominantly from the geographic trade areas surrounding each of our office locations 
we rely primarily on customer service and long standing relationships with customers to attract and retain deposits  however  market interest rates and rates offered by competing financial institutions significantly affect our ability to attract and retain deposits

we have access to a variety of borrowing sources and use short term and long term borrowings to support our asset base 
short term borrowings include federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  us treasury demand notes  federal home loan bank advances and correspondent bank lines of credit 
we also offer a deposit account that sweeps balances in excess of an agreed upon target amount into overnight repurchase agreements 
as business customers have grown more sophisticated in managing their daily cash position  demand for the sweep product has increased 
short term borrowings decreased by million to million at december  compared to million at december the following table sets forth certain information regarding our short term borrowings at the dates and for the periods indicated dollars in thousands at or for the year ended december  federal funds purchased average balance outstanding maximum outstanding at any month end during the period balance outstanding at end of period weighted average interest rate during the period weighted average interest rate at end of the period securities sold under agreements to repurchase average balance outstanding maximum outstanding at any month end during the period balance outstanding at end of period weighted average interest rate during the period weighted average interest rate at end of the period us treasury demand notes average balance outstanding maximum outstanding at any month end during the period balance outstanding at end of period weighted average interest rate during the period weighted average interest rate at end of the period federal home loan bank advances average balance outstanding maximum outstanding at any month end during the period balance outstanding at end of period weighted average interest rate during the period weighted average interest rate at end of the period correspondent bank lines of credit average balance outstanding maximum outstanding at any month end during the period balance outstanding at end of period weighted average interest rate during the period weighted average interest rate at end of the period long term borrowings include notes payable to other banks to support a portfolio of equipment that we own and lease to other companies  as well as general debt incurred to fund corporate acquisitions

liquidity management is monitored by the asset liability management committee and boards of directors of each our subsidiary banks  which review historical funding requirements  current liquidity position  sources and stability of funding  marketability of assets  options for attracting additional funds  and anticipated future funding needs  including the level of unfunded commitments 
our banks primary sources of funds are retail and commercial deposits  short term and long term borrowings  public funds and funds generated from operations 
funds from operations include principal and interest payments received on loans and securities 
while maturities and scheduled amortization of loans and securities provide an indication of the timing of the receipt of funds  changes in interest rates  economic conditions and competition strongly influence mortgage prepayment rates and deposit flows  reducing the predictability of the timing on sources of funds 
our banks have no required regulatory liquidity ratios to maintain  however  they each adhere to a liquidity policy  approved by their board of directors  who set certain guidelines for liquidity purposes 
this policy requires that the banks maintain the following liquidity ratios liquidity ratio defined as cash  short term investments  marketable securities and investment grade scheduled lease loan payments due in one year or less divided by deposits plus short term liabilities greater than dependency ratio defined as net potentially volatile liabilities divided by total earning assets less short term investments should not exceed for more than days 
loans excluding lease loans where the related lessee has outstanding securities rated investment grade or where the related lessee would be viewed under our underwriting policies as an investment grade company to deposits less than loans including all lease loans to deposits less than 
at december   our banks were in compliance with the foregoing policy 
generally  when the banks liquidity ratios fall outside policy guidelines  loans are sold to provide a source of funds and reduce the volume of total loans 
in addition to the liquidity policy to which our banks are subject  our bylaws currently provide that  unless our board of directors  by a vote of two thirds of the entire board  approves otherwise  we  on a consolidated basis  may not have a ratio of loans excluding lease loans where the related lessee has outstanding securities rated investment grade or where the related lessee would be viewed under our underwriting policies as an investment grade company to deposits in excess of  or a ratio of loans including all lease loans to deposits in excess of 
at december   our banks had outstanding loan origination commitments and unused commercial and retail lines of credit of million 
our banks anticipate that they will have sufficient funds available to meet current origination and other lending commitments 
certificates of deposit that are scheduled to mature within one year totaled billion at december  and december   respectively 
we expect to retain a substantial majority of these certificates of deposit 
in the event that additional short term liquidity is needed  our banks have established relationships with several large regional banks to provide short term borrowings in the form of federal funds purchases 
while  at december   there were no firm lending commitments in place  our banks have borrowed  and management believes that they could again borrow  million for a short time from these banks on a collective basis 
additionally  mb financial bank is a member of the federal home loan bank of chicago  illinois and union bank  na is a member of the federal home loan bank of topeka  kansas and both banks have the ability to borrow from their respective federal home loan banks 
as a contingency plan for significant funding needs  the asset liability management committee may also consider the sale of investment securities  selling securities under agreement to repurchase or the temporary curtailment of lending activities 
corporation liquidity 
our main sources of liquidity at the holding company level are dividends from our subsidiary banks and a line of credit maintained with a large regional correspondent bank in the amount of million 
as of december   we had million undrawn and available under our line of credit 
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and other potential funding needs at december  in thousands time deposits long term debt operating leases total thereafter total commitments to extend credit long term debt includes company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities 
our subsidiary banks are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal and state banking agencies  which affect their ability to pay dividends to us 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on our financial statements 
additionally  our bylaws effectively limit the amount of dividends our banks may pay to us by currently requiring each bank to maintain total risk based capital  tier risk based capital and tier leverage capital ratios of  and  respectively  unless our board of directors  by a vote of two thirds of the entire board  approves otherwise 
the minimum ratios required for a bank to be considered well capitalized for regulatory purposes are  and  respectively 
at december   our subsidiary banks could pay a combined million in dividends and comply with our bylaws regarding minimum regulatory capital ratios 
in addition to adhering to our bylaws  there are regulatory restrictions on the ability of national banks to pay dividends 
see item business supervision and regulation 
capital resources our subsidiary banks are subject to the risk based capital regulations administered by the banking regulatory agencies 
the risk based capital guidelines are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banks to account for off balance sheet exposure and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets 
under the regulations  assets and off balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories  each with appropriate weights 
the resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk weighted assets and off balance sheet items 
under the prompt corrective action regulations  to be adequately capitalized a bank must maintain minimum ratios of total capital to risk weighted assets of  tier capital to risk weighted assets of  and tier capital to total assets of 
failure to meet these capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary  actions by regulators  which  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on the banks financial statements 
as of december   the most recent notification from the federal banking regulators categorized each of our subsidiary banks as well capitalized 
a well capitalized institution must maintain a minimum ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets of at least  a minimum ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets of at least  a minimum ratio of tier capital to total assets of at least and must not be subject to any written order  agreement or directive requiring it to meet or maintain a specific capital level 
there are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed our banks capital classification 
on a consolidated basis  we must maintain a minimum ratio of tier capital to total assets of  a minimum ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets of and a minimum ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets of 
see item business supervision and regulation capital adequacy and prompt corrective action 
in addition  our bylaws currently require us  on a consolidated basis  to maintain these ratios at or above  and  respectively  unless our board of directors  by a vote of two thirds of the entire board  approves otherwise 
as of december   we and each of our subsidiary banks were well capitalized under the capital adequacy requirements to which each of us are subject

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset liability management our net interest income is subject to interest rate risk to the extent that it can vary based on changes in the general level of interest rates 
it is our policy to maintain an acceptable level of interest rate risk over a range of possible changes in interest rates while remaining responsive to market demand for loan and deposit products 
the strategy we employ to manage our interest rate risk is to measure our risk using an asset liability simulation model and adjust the maturity of securities in our investment portfolio to manage that risk 
also  to limit risk  we generally do not make fixed rate loans or accept fixed rate deposits with terms of more than five years 
interest rate risk can also be measured by analyzing the extent to which the repricing of assets and liabilities are mismatched to create an interest sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific period if it will mature or reprice within that period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  therefore  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income 
conversely  during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap position would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
the following table sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december  that we anticipate  based upon certain assumptions  to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
except as stated below  the amount of assets and liabilities shown which reprice or mature during a particular period were determined based on the earlier of the term to repricing or the term to repayment of the asset or liability 
the table is intended to provide an approximation of the projected repricing of assets and liabilities at december  based on contractual maturities and scheduled rate adjustments within a three month period and subsequent selected time intervals 
the loan amounts in the table reflect principal balances expected to be reinvested and or repriced because of contractual amortization and rate adjustments on adjustable rate loans 
loan and investment securities contractual maturities and amortization reflect modest prepayment assumptions 
while now  money market and savings deposit accounts have adjustable rates  it is assumed that the interest rates on these accounts will not adjust immediately to changes in other interest rates 
therefore  the information in the table is calculated assuming that now  money market and savings deposits will reprice as follows  and  respectively  in the first three months    and  respectively  in the next nine months  and  and  respectively  after one year dollars in thousands time to maturity or repricing days days years over years total interest earning assets interest bearing deposits with banks federal funds sold investment securities available for sale loans held for sale loans total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities now and money market deposit accounts savings deposits time deposits short term borrowings long term borrowings company obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities total interest bearing liabilities rate sensitive assets rsa rate sensitive liabilities rsl cumulative gap gap rsa rsl rsa total assets rsl total assets gap total assets gap rsa certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types of assets may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
therefore  we do not rely solely on a gap analysis to manage our interest rate risk  but rather we use what we believe to be the more reliable simulation model relating to changes in net interest income 
based on simulation modeling at december  and  our net interest income would change over a one year time period due to changes in interest rates as follows dollars in thousands change in net interest income over one year horizon changes in levels of interest rates at december  at december  dollar change percentage change dollar change percentage change our simulations assume the following changes in interest rates are immediate 
changes in net interest income between december  and december  reflect changes in the composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  related interest rates  repricing frequencies  and the fixed or variable characteristics of the interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities
