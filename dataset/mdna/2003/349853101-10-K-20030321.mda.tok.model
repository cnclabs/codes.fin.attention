in circumstances in which management is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to the company for example  bankruptcy filings  accounts turned over for collection or litigation  the company records a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount the company reasonably 
table of contents believes will be collected 
for all other customers  the company recognizes reserves for bad debts based on the length of time the receivables are past due 
specifically  amounts that are days or more past due are reserved at 
if circumstances change ie  higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to the company  the estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to the company could be reduced by a material amount 
allowance for revenue adjustments the company s allowance for revenue adjustments consists of amounts reserved for billing rate changes that are not captured upon load initiation 
these adjustments generally arise when the sales department contemporaneously grants small rate changes spot quotes to customers that differ from the standard rates in the system  when freight requires dimensionalization or is reweighed resulting in a different required rate  when billing errors occur  and when data entry errors occur 
when appropriate  permanent rate changes are initiated and reflected in the system 
the company monitors the manual revenue adjustments closely through the employment of various controls that are in place to ensure that revenue recognition is not compromised or that fraud does not occur 
during  average revenue adjustments per month were approximately  on average revenue per month of million less than of monthly revenue 
in order to estimate the allowance for revenue adjustments related to ending accounts receivable  the company prepares an analysis that considers average monthly revenue adjustments and the average lag for identifying and quantifying these revenue adjustments 
based on this analysis  the company establishes an allowance for approximately days dependent upon experience in the last twelve months of average revenue adjustments  adjusted for rebates and billing errors 
the lag is periodically adjusted based on actual historical experience 
additionally  the average amount of revenue adjustments per month can vary in relation to the level of sales or based on other factors such as personnel issues that could result in excessive manual errors or in excessive spot quotes being granted 
both of these significant assumptions are continually evaluated for validity

using data obtained from this monitoring and the company s assumptions about the emerging trends  management develops information about the size of ultimate claims based on its historical experience and other available market information 
the most significant assumptions used in the estimation process include determining the trend in loss costs  the expected consistency in the frequency and severity of claims incurred but not yet reported to prior 
table of contents year claims  changes in the timing of the reporting of losses from the loss date to the notification date  and expected costs to settle unpaid claims
