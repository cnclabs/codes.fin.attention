item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following is a summary of certain information contained in this report and is qualified in its entirety by the detailed information and financial statements that appear elsewhere herein 
except for the historical information contained herein  the matters set forth in this report include forward looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of these forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially 
these risks and uncertainties are detailed throughout the report and will be further discussed from time to time in the company s periodic reports filed with the commission 
the forward looking statements included in the report speak only as of the date hereof 
the financial performance of fiscal year was a considerable improvement over the prior two years 
the improvement is attributable to two primary factors 
first  ready mix inc had their best year ever and the expansion plans that contributed to losses in and produced increased revenue and increased profit on much improved margins 
rmi revenue has grown since year end second  highway contracts on which claims have been filed were completed prior to and did not have any additional material losses in during the year  considerable progress was achieved in progressing the claims through the mandatory claim review process 
for the five projects in dispute with the new mexico state highway and transportation department nmshtd  all but one have now been heard by the state claims review board review board  the third and final step in the administrative review process required before a contractor would resort to litigation 
the fifth new mexico project will go before the review board in april at any point in the review process  or even after litigation may be initiated  it is possible that the company and the nmshtd may seek to open settlement discussions 
the clark county  nevada claim is scheduled to be heard by a three member arbitration panel in the fall of and it is conceivable that the binding arbitration will be completed before year end 
non payment of claim costs has been the primary cause for the company s decreased working capital and weakened financial condition  which in turn  has decreased the company s bonding capacity 
due to the company s bonding capacity constraint the company s backlog at december  of million declined from the preceding year s million 
the decreased bonding capacity continues to limit the company s ability to bid on contracts for which the company would historically compete 
these circumstances create a very real challenge to maintain  let alone increase  backlog 
company management continually looks at all reasonable and available options to improve cash balances and working capital  including the sale or disposition of assets  cost cutting and containment  personnel reductions  financing alternatives or attracting capital 
to the degree that the company succeeds in that effort  bonding capacity may improve 
results of operations the following table sets forth statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated years ended december  revenue cost of revenue gross profit general and administrative expenses income loss from operations interest income interest expense other income expense net income loss 
table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue and backlog 
revenue decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  
the decrease was the result of a million decrease in construction service revenue offset by a million increase in revenue generated from construction materials production and manufacturing sold to non affiliates 
backlog decreased to million at december  compared to million at december  revenue is impacted in any one period by the backlog at the beginning of the period 
because so much of the company s business stems from competitively bid public works  backlog will fluctuate depending upon the amount and type of contracts that the company bids on and wins 
bid bonds provided by the company s surety company are required on most of the contracts that the company bids  therefore  any restrictions or limitations in the extension of surety credit can impact the amount and type of contracts available to be bid by the company 
recent limitations to the company s surety credit have contributed to the company s declining backlog 
surety credit limits may be improved as the company s financial performance improves  but there can be no assurance that surety credit will improve as there also exist insurance industry and individual insurance company dynamics that are unrelated to the company s performance

the increase in the construction services gross profit margin was the result of reductions in costs related to claims and costs overruns on certain projects and by increased profit recognition related to several projects nearing completion at december  gross profit margins are affected by a variety of factors including construction delays and difficulties due to weather conditions  availability of materials  the timing of work performed by other subcontractors and the physical and geological condition of the construction site

impact of inflation the company believes that inflation has not had a material impact on its operations 
however  substantial increases in labor costs  worker compensation rates and employee benefits  equipment costs  material or subcontractor costs could adversely affect the operations of the company for future periods 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
we believe our most critical accounting policies are the revenue recognition and cost estimation on certain contracts for which we use a percentage of completion accounting method  our allowance for doubtful accounts and the allowance for obsolete inventory 
the revenue recognition and cost estimation accounting method is applied by our construction services operations to heavy construction projects executed under multi year contracts with various customers 
approximately  and of total net revenue was recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting during  and  respectively 
revenues and costs from fixed price and modified fixed price construction contracts are recognized for each contract on the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date to the estimated total of direct costs 
direct costs include  among other things  direct labor  field labor  equipment rent  subcontracting  direct materials  and direct overhead 
general and administrative expenses are accounted for as period costs and are  therefore  not included in the calculation of the estimates to complete construction contracts in progress 
project losses are provided in the period in which such losses are determined  without reference to the percentage of completion 
as contracts can extend over one or more accounting periods  revisions in costs and earnings estimated during the course of the work are reflected during the accounting period in which the facts that required such revisions become known 
the asset costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts represents revenue recognized in excess of amounts billed 
the liability billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts represents billings in excess of revenues recognized 
the complexity of the estimation process and all issues related to the assumptions  risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the percentage of completion method of accounting affects the amounts reported in our financial statements 
a number of internal and external factors affect our percentage of completion estimates  including labor rate and efficiency variances  estimated future material prices and customer specification changes 
if our business conditions were different  or if we used different assumptions in the application of this accounting policy  it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported in our financial statements 

table of contents we are also required to estimate the collectibility of our account receivables 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realization of these receivables  including the current creditworthiness of each customer and the related aging of the past due balances 
our provision for bad debts during the years ended december  and amounted to  and  respectively 
we determine our reserve by using percentages applied to certain aged receivable categories and percentages of certain types of revenue generated 
in addition  we are required to state our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to the future demand requirements and compare these with the current inventory levels 
our reserve requirements generally increase as our projected demand requirements decrease due to market conditions and longer than expected usage periods 
at december  and  inventories of  and  respectively  are net of reserves of  and respectively 
it is possible that significant changes in required inventory reserves may continue to occur in the future if there is a further decline in market conditions 
summary of contractual obligations and commercial commitments contractual obligations at december   and the effects such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods  are summarized as follows payments due by period less than after total year years years years contractual obligations long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases total contractual obligations amount of commitment expiration per period total amounts less than over committed year years years years other commercial commitments line of credit recent accounting pronouncements in june  financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the statement requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  the entity capitalizes a cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement 
the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in june  fasb issued statement no 
sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  effective for activities that are initiated after december   with early application encouraged 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies 
table of contents emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring

sfas no 
 acquisitions of certain financial institutions  an amendment of fasb statements no 
and and fasb interpretation no 
 effective for acquisitions on or after october  sfas no 
 and fasb interpretation no 
 provided interpretive guidance on the application of the purchase method to acquisitions of financial institutions 
except for transactions between two or more mutual enterprises  this statement removes acquisitions of financial institutions from the scope of both sfas no 
and fasb interpretation and requires that those transactions be accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
thus  the requirement in paragraph of sfas no 
to recognize and subsequently amortize any excess of the fair value of liabilities assumed over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired as an unidentifiable intangible asset no longer applies to acquisitions within the scope of sfas no 
in addition  sfas no 
amends sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  to include in its scope long term customer relationship intangible assets of financial institutions such as depositor and borrower relationship intangible assets and credit cardholder intangible assets 
consequently  those intangible assets are subject to the same undiscounted cash flow recoverability test and impairment loss recognition and measurement provisions that statement requires for other long lived assets that are held and used 
the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin expands on the accounting guidance of sfas no 
 and and incorporates without change the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 which is being superceded 
fin elaborates on existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees  including standby letters of credit 
it also clarifies that guarantees must be recognized as an initial liability for fair value  or market value  of the obligations assumed under the guarantee and that this information must be disclosed in interim and annual financial statements 
fin applies on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the company does not anticipate the adoption of fin to have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations

in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the company is required to follow the prescribed format and provide the additional disclosures required by sfas no 
in its annual financial statements for the year ended december  and must also provide the disclosures in its quarterly reports containing condensed financial statements for interim periods beginning with the quarterly period ended march  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations in january  fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin which requires the consolidation of variable interest entities  as defined 
fin is applicable to financial statements to be issued by the company after  however  disclosures are required currently if the company expects to consolidate any variable interest entities 
the company does not currently believe that any material entities will be consolidated with the company as a result of fin known and anticipated future trends and contingencies with continued improvement in profitability and working capital  it is anticipated that the company s bonding limits will increase proportionately  thereby allowing the company to bid on and perform more and larger projects 
conversely  if the company fails to maintain or further enhance the improving trends started in  bonding capacity could decline 
any decline in bonding below existing levels would require significant reorganization of personnel and resources 

table of contents the company believes that government  at all levels  will continue to be the primary source of funding for infrastructure work 
the national transportation legislation  tea  established a total budget authority of billion over the six year period tea ensured that tax revenue deposited into the highway trust fund would be spent on transportation improvements by guaranteeing billion for highways and billion for transit and by further stipulating that appropriators can spend trust fund dollars only on transportation 
annual spending authorizations under tea have been consistent with anticipated levels  however  a component of the tea legislation called revenue aligned budget authority raba  may increase or decrease funding proportionate to tax proceeds increases or decreases 
just months ago  declines in tax revenues  due to the recent recession  created a downward adjustment in funding from the raba component of tea and it looked as though the bush administration was going to cut highway funding by approximately billion from to debate over highway funding for tea s final year of appears to be reaching a close and it appears that the funding level will rest somewhere between the billion approved by the us senate or the billion supported by the house 
interim resolutions until final spending authorization is passed have allowed funding to continue at the annual rate of billion 
over the next few months until funding authority is finalized  state departments of transportation may not let as many contracts until they are fully aware of the funding available to them 
the competitive bidding process will continue to be the dominant method for determining contract award 
however  other innovative bidding methods will be tried and may gain favor  namely a plus b contracts  where the bidders proposals are selected on both price and scheduling criteria 
design build projects are becoming more common and are likely to increase in frequency 
design build projects also tend to be of more worth to the owner when the contract size is substantial  usually million or more 
in light of the rising needs for infrastructure work throughout the nation and the tendency of the current needs to out pace the supply of funds  it is anticipated that alternative funding sources will continue to be sought 
funding for infrastructure development in the united states is coming from a growing variety of innovative sources 
an increase of funding measures is being undertaken by various levels of government to help solve traffic congestion and related air quality problems 
sales taxes  fuel taxes  user fees in a variety of forms  vehicle license taxes  private toll roads and quasi public toll roads are examples of how transportation funding is evolving 
transportation norms are being challenged by federally mandated air quality standards 
improving traffic movement  eliminating congestion  increasing public transit  adding or designating high occupancy vehicle hov lanes to encourage car pooling and other solutions are being considered in order to help meet epa imposed air quality standards 
there is also a trend toward local and state legislation regulating growth and urban sprawl 
the passage of such legislation and the degree of growth limits imposed by it could dramatically affect the nature of the company s markets 
seasonality the construction industry is seasonal  generally due to inclement weather occurring in the winter months 
accordingly  the company may experience a seasonal pattern in its operating results with lower revenue in the first and fourth quarters of each calendar year than other quarters 
quarterly results may also be affected by the timing of bid solicitations by governmental authorities  the stage of completion of major projects and revenue recognition policies 
results for any one quarter  therefore  may not be indicative of results for other quarters or for the year 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk that losses may occur in the values of financial instruments as a result of movements in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
the company does not have foreign currency exchange rate and commodity price market risk 
interest rate risk from time to time the company temporarily invests its excess cash and restricted cash in interest bearing securities issued by high quality issuers 
the company s management monitors risk exposure to monies invested in securities in its financial institutions 
due to the short time the investments are outstanding and their general liquidity  these instruments are classified as cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheet and do not represent a material interest rate risk to the company 
the company s primary market risk exposure for changes in interest rates relates to the company s long term debt obligations 
the company manages its exposure to changing interest rates principally through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt 

table of contents the company evaluated the potential effect that near term changes in interest rates would have had on the fair value of its interest rate risk sensitive financial instruments at december  assuming a basis point increase in the prime interest rate at december  the potential increase in the fair value of the company s debt obligations would have been approximately  at december  see notes and in the accompanying consolidated financial statement
