results of operations overview the sections of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contain forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of which involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results may differ significantly from results discussed in the forward looking statements due to a number of important factors  including  but not limited to the company s extremely limited operations  the uncertainties of clinical trial results and product development  the company s dependence on third parties for licensing and other revenue and risks of technological change and competition 
since its inception through december   the company has incurred ongoing losses from operations and has cumulative losses as of december  totaling  through year end  the company has not recorded any revenue from the sale of products 
revenue recorded through december  was earned in connection with license rights  contract research and the granting of certain short term rights 
as a result  inflation has not materially affected the company s revenues and income from continuing operations 
in august  autoimmune and deseret laboratories  inc entered into a joint venture by forming an entity called colloral llc to manufacture  market and sell colloral as a nutraceutical 
autoimmune s interest in colloral llc is greater than  but autoimmune does not have control of colloral llc 
therefore  the investment is accounted for using the equity method 
to the extent that colloral llc generates revenues in excess of cumulative losses  autoimmune will record income 
in february  colloral llc began marketing colloral through direct mail solicitation of individuals who had previously expressed interest in obtaining the product 
it is anticipated that sales channels and promotional support will be expanded in the future  but there can be no assurance that the company will derive revenues from this arrangement 
accordingly  the company might remain in the development stage in the future and may continue to incur substantial losses

liquidity and capital resources the company s needs for funds have historically fluctuated from period to period as it has increased or decreased the scope of its research and development activities 
since inception  the company has funded these needs almost entirely through sales of its equity securities 
its current needs have been significantly reduced as a result of the termination of research  development and administrative employees and other operating expenses in as of december   the company had an outstanding contractual obligation to the brigham and women s hospital to sponsor research totaling  in addition  autoimmune holds an interest in an entity called colloral llc  which is manufacturing  marketing and selling colloral as a nutraceutical 
autoimmune has no obligation to make additional capital contributions to colloral llc 
to the extent that colloral llc generates revenues in excess of cumulative losses and makes distributions  autoimmune will obtain income 
the company s working capital and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the strategic direction that the company and its shareholders choose  the level of resources that the company devotes to the development of its patented products  the extent to which it proceeds by means of collaborative relationships with pharmaceutical or nutraceutical companies and its competitive environment 
based upon its budget for the calendar year  the company believes that current cash and marketable securities and the interest earned from the investment thereof will be sufficient to meet the company s operating expenses and capital requirements for at least five years 
at the appropriate time  the company may seek additional funding through public or private equity or debt financings  collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical companies or from other sources 
if additional funds are necessary but not available  the company will have to reduce certain activities  which could include areas of research  product development  manufacturing or marketing activity  or otherwise modify its business strategy 
such a reduction would have a material adverse effect on the company 
in order to preserve principal and maintain liquidity  the company s funds through year end have been invested in us treasury obligations and other short term instruments 
as of december   the company s cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled  current liabilities at december  were  in the future  the company plans to invest a portion of its funds in high grade corporate bonds to increase the yield it receives on its investments 
off balance sheet arrangements autoimmune has not created  and is not party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt or operating parts of its business that are not consolidated into its financial statements 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements revenue is recognized in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
revenue is recognized when the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and risk of loss has passed  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
contract and license fee revenue is primarily generated through collaborative license and development agreements with strategic partners for the development and commercialization of the company s product candidates 
the terms of the agreements typically include non refundable license fees  funding of research and development  payments based upon achievement of certain milestones  or royalties on net product sales 
revenue arrangements where multiple products or services are sold together under one contract are evaluated to determine if each element represents a separate earnings process 
in the event that an element of such multiple element arrangement does not represent a separate earnings process  revenue from this element is recognized over the term of the related contract 
where the company has continuing performance obligations under the terms of a collaborative arrangement or associated with non refundable license fees  revenue is recognized over the period the company completes its performance obligations 
under the terms of one agreement  the company and brigham women s hospital have indemnified a subsidiary of elan against any claim  demand or action arising from any misrepresentation made to the subsidiary elan about patent rights and warranties  up to the amounts previously received by the company under the agreement 
the company does not consider this a performance obligation that would preclude or defer revenue recognition 
option fees representing payments to be made to the company for a right to evaluate and negotiate the terms of a potential licensing arrangement are recognized when the options are granted because such fees are non refundable and the company has no further obligations 
revenues from milestone payments related to arrangements under which the company has no continuing performance obligations are recognized upon achievement of the related milestone 
revenues from milestone payments related to arrangements under which the company has continuing performance obligations are recognized as revenue upon achievement of the milestone only if all of the following conditions are met the milestone payments are non refundable  substantive effort is involved in achieving the milestone  and the amount of the milestone is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with achievement of the milestone 
if any of these conditions are not met  the milestone payments are deferred and recognized as revenue over the term of the arrangement as the company completes its performance obligations 
revenue from service contracts is earned as the related services are performed 
marketable securities are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below cost basis is determined to be other than temporary 
the company employs a methodology in evaluating whether a decline in fair value below cost basis is other than temporary that considers available evidence regarding its marketable securities 
in the event that the cost basis of a security exceeds its fair value  the company evaluates  among 
table of contents other factors the duration of the period that  and extent to which  the fair value is less than the cost basis  the financial health of and business outlook for the issuer of the securities  including industry and sector performance  changes in technology and operational and financing cash flow factors  overall market conditions and trends  and the company s intent and ability to hold the investment 
once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  a write down is recorded and a new cost basis in the security is established 
assessing the above factors involves inherent uncertainty 
accordingly  write downs  if recorded  could be materially different from the actual market performance of marketable securities in the company s portfolio  if  among other things  relevant information related to its marketable securities was not publicly available or other factors not considered would have been relevant to the determination of impairment
