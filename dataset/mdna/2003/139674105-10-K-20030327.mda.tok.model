on march   the company completed a purchase and assumption transaction with wachovia bank  na  formerly first union national bank wachovia and acquired six of wachovia s offices in georgia which included real estate  loans and deposits 
the transaction resulted in approximately million in intangible assets  primarily core deposit intangibles  which are being amortized over a year period 
the company purchased approximately million in loans and assumed deposits of approximately million 
on march   the company completed its acquisition of first bankshares of west point  inc  and its subsidiary  first national bank of west point 
at the time of the acquisition  first national bank of west point had approximately million in assets with one office in west point  georgia  and two offices in the greater valley area of alabama 
first bankshares of west point  inc  merged with the company  and first national bank of west point merged with capital city bank 
the company issued shares and in cash for each of the  outstanding shares of first bankshares of west point  inc  resulting in the issuance of  shares of company common stock and the payment of million in cash for a total purchase price of approximately million 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase and resulted in approximately million of intangible assets  primarily goodwill 
the company is headquartered in tallahassee and  as of december   had offices covering counties in florida  four counties in georgia and one county in alabama

the increase in earnings was attributable to growth in operating revenues due to improvements in net interest income of and noninterest income of 
the net interest margin increased basis points over to a level of  attributable to a basis point reduction in the company s cost of funds 
growth in noninterest income resulted from increased mortgage banking revenues reflecting the higher volume of fixed rate residential mortgages sold to the secondary market  a sale of selected long term adjustable rate mortgage loans and an increase in service charge fees 
the loan sale recorded in the fourth quarter generated an after tax gain of approximately per diluted share 
these and other significant factors are discussed throughout the financial review

changes which are not solely due to volume changes or solely due to rate changes have been attributed to rate changes 
interest income includes the effects of taxable equivalent adjustments using a tax rate to adjust interest on tax exempt loans and securities to a taxable equivalent basis 
for the year  taxable equivalent interest income decreased million  or  over  compared to an increase of million  or  in over new loan production and repricing of existing earning assets produced a basis point reduction in the yield on earning assets  which declined from for to for this compares to a basis point reduction in over the unfavorable impact of declining yields was partially mitigated by growth in earning assets of million and an overall improvement in the mix 
as shown in table  the loan portfolio was the largest contributor to the net reduction in interest income 
in the current rate environment  portfolio repricing will continue to put pressure on interest income  but may be partially or completely offset by earning asset growth 
interest expense decreased million  or  over  compared to an increase of million  or  in over the general decline in interest rates produced favorable rate variances on interest bearing liabilities throughout the year 
this was further enhanced by a favorable shift in mix  as certificates of deposit generally a higher cost deposit product declined relative to total deposits 
certificates of deposit  as a percent of total average deposits  declined from in to in lower interest rates and a favorable shift in mix led to a decline in the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities in of basis points compared to late in the third quarter  the company obtained a million advance from the federal home loan bank to fund anticipated future loan growth 
the advance carries a weighted average rate of 
initially  this transaction will adversely impact the margin as the monies will be invested in overnight funds until deployed into the loan portfolio 
the company s interest rate spread defined as the taxable equivalent yield on average earning assets less the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities increased basis points in and decreased basis points in the significant increase in is attributable to management s ability to rapidly adjust the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities relative to the decline in yield on earning assets 
the decrease in was attributable to the lower earning asset yield 
the company s net interest margin defined as taxable equivalent interest income less interest expense divided by average earning assets was in  compared to in and in in  the lower rates paid on interest bearing liabilities and the higher volume of earning assets resulted in a basis point increase in the margin 
repricing of maturing certificates of deposit and continued loan growth are anticipated to have a favorable impact on the net interest margin during the upcoming year 
however  this may be partially or completely offset by unfavorable repricing variances associated with loans and securities and any further changes in the federal reserve s target rate on overnight funds 
a further discussion of the company s earning assets and funding sources can be found in the section entitled financial condition 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses was million in  compared to million in and million in the decrease in the provision reflects the company s lower level of charge offs and stable credit quality 
the company experienced improvement in the credit quality of its consumer loan portfolio reflecting recent adjustments to its underwriting criteria 
in  consumer loan net charge offs declined both in terms of absolute dollars and as a percentage of total net charge offs 
net charge offs remain at historically low levels relative to the size of the portfolio 
in  the decrease of  is largely due to lower gross charge offs and improved recovery efforts 
the company s nonperforming assets ratio decreased to from at year end  and the net charge off ratio decreased to 
versus 
in at december   the allowance for loan losses totaled million compared to million in at year end  the allowance represented of total loans 
management considers the allowance to be adequate based on the current level of nonperforming loans and the estimate of losses inherent in the portfolio at year end 
see the section entitled financial condition and tables and for further information regarding the allowance for loan losses 
selected loss coverage ratios are presented below provision for loan losses as a multiple of net charge offs x x x pre tax income plus provision for loan losses as a multiple of net charge offs x x x noninterest income in  noninterest income increased million  or  and represented of taxable equivalent operating revenue  compared to an increase of million  or  and  respectively  in the increase in the level of noninterest income is attributable primarily to growth in service charge income on deposit accounts  mortgage banking revenues  and other income 
the increase in was primarily attributable to all categories except data processing revenues 
factors affecting noninterest income are discussed below 
service charges on deposit accounts increased million  or  in  compared to an increase of million  or  in service charge revenues in any one year are dependent on the number of accounts  primarily transaction accounts  the level of activity subject to service charges and the collection rate 
the increase in reflects an increase in the number of accounts primarily attributable to the georgia acquisitions and the introduction of a new overdraft protection program in the fourth quarter of a full year versus a partial year in of the overdraft protection program will result in higher revenues in the increase in is primarily attributable to the georgia acquisitions 
data processing revenues decreased  or  in versus a decrease of  or  in the data processing center provides computer services to both financial and non financial clients in north florida and south georgia 
the decrease in was primarily a result of a decline in revenues from financial clients 
the company added a financial client late in the fourth quarter of  increasing the number being processed to six 
in  processing revenues for non financial entities represented approximately of total processing  compared to in the company completed its systems conversion to a third party provider for all financial clients during the first quarter of management does not anticipate a significant increase in data processing revenues during the decrease in total processing revenues for was primarily the result of a decline in revenues for financial clients 
in  asset management fees decreased  or  versus an increase of  or  in fees lost due to distributions and the decline in stock market values over the past year have outpaced the incremental revenues attributable to new business development 
at year end  assets under management totaled approximately million  reflecting growth of million  or 
this growth was attributable to the generation of new accounts in existing markets  including new georgia markets acquired in at year end  assets under management totaled million  reflecting growth of million  or over the company continues to be among the leaders in the production of residential mortgage loans in most of its markets 
in  mortgage banking revenues increased million  or  compared to an increase of million  or in the company generally sells all fixed rate residential loan production into the secondary market 
the low interest rates have produced a high level of fixed rate production and increased mortgage banking revenues 
the further decline in interest rates during continued a trend of higher levels of fixed rate mortgage production in excess of of total production 
during the fourth quarter  the company sold million of residential real estate loans generating a pre tax gain of approximately  the level of interest rates  origination volume and percent of fixed rate production is expected to impact the company s ability to maintain the current level of mortgage banking revenues throughout the increase in revenue during reflects the declining rate environment experienced throughout the year  which produced a high level of fixed rate production 
other noninterest income increased  or  in versus an increase of million  or in the increase in was attributable primarily to retail brokerage fees and atm debit credit card transaction fees 
retail brokerage fees increased  or over the company continues to strategically place investment advisors in its office network and expand its customer relationships through sales of investment management and brokerage products 
atm debit credit cards increased  or  due to higher transaction volume 
the increase was primarily attributable to increased atm debit credit card fees  accounts receivable financing  credit related insurance revenue and safe deposit fees 
noninterest income as a percent of average assets increased to in  compared to in and in  driven by service charge income  mortgage banking revenues and retail brokerage fees 
noninterest expense noninterest expense for was million  an increase of million  or  over  compared with an increase of million  or  in factors impacting the company s noninterest expense during and are discussed below 
the company s aggregate compensation expense in totaled million  an increase of million  or  over the increase is primarily attributable to the addition of the georgia and alabama offices  performance based compensation profit participation  commissions and incentives  increased pension costs and higher healthcare insurance premiums 
the higher pension cost is a result of an increase in the number of plan participants and the lower than expected return on plan assets resulting from the general stock market decline in recent years 
pension costs are expected to increase in by approximately 
healthcare premiums are expected to continue to increase due to additional participants and rising costs from healthcare providers 
in  aggregate compensation increased million  or  over this increase was primarily due to the addition of associates from the georgia acquisitions  higher commissions related to mortgage banking  increased pension costs and higher healthcare insurance premiums 
occupancy expense including furniture  fixtures and equipment increased by  or  in  compared to million  or in the increase in was primarily due to the addition of nine offices added with the georgia acquisitions and the completion of the data processing systems conversion 
the increase in depreciation was attributable to the assets added through acquisitions and the implementation of a new data processing system 
additional increases were experienced in office leases and building maintenance repairs 
the increase in was attributable to higher depreciation  maintenance  and utilities associated with the georgia acquisitions 
other noninterest expense increased million  or  in  compared to million  or  in the increase in was attributable to higher legal costs of  primarily resulting from merchant credit card processing see section entitled other in liquidity and capital resources for further discussion  increased professional fees associated with external audit  tax and pension consulting of  increased processing expenses of  associated with customization of a newly implemented data processing system  increased atm processing and trust account processing  increased contributions of  attributable to increased funding for capital city bank group foundation  inc  increased telephone costs of  resulting from georgia acquisitions and line upgrades to the existing wide area network  and higher miscellaneous expense of million attributable to loan underwriting closing costs  other losses cash short  credit card interchange fees  seminars education  and other miscellaneous 
the increase in was attributable to higher legal costs of  associated with merchant credit card processing see section entitled other in liquidity and capital resources for further discussion  increased telephone costs of  due to the georgia acquisitions and systems conversion  increased advertising costs of  higher intangible amortization of  that resulted from georgia acquisitions  commission service fees of  higher postage costs of  and higher credit card interchange costs of million 
the net noninterest expense ratio defined as noninterest income minus noninterest expense  net of intangible amortization and conversion merger related expenses  as a percent of average assets was in  compared to in and in the company s efficiency ratio expressed as noninterest expense  net of intangible amortization and conversion merger related expenses  as a percent of taxable equivalent operating revenues was  and in  and  respectively 
income taxes the consolidated provision for federal and state income taxes was million in  compared to million in and million in the increase in the tax provision was a result of higher taxable income and a decline in tax exempt income 
the decrease in the tax provision from was primarily attributable to lower taxable income 
the effective tax rate was in  in  and in these rates differ from the combined federal and state statutory tax rates due primarily to tax exempt income 
the increase in the effective tax rate for is primarily attributable to an increase in state taxable income as well as a decline of tax exempt income relative to pre tax income 
tax exempt income net of the adjustment for disallowed interest as a percent of pre tax income was in  in  and in the decline during the past three years was primarily a result of growth in pre tax income  maturities in the tax exempt security portfolio and management s decision to use these proceeds to fund loan growth  rather than replace maturities in the portfolio 
see section entitled financial condition for further discussion 
financial condition average assets totaled billion  an increase of million  or  in versus the comparable period in average earning assets increased to billion in  a million  or  increase over throughout  there has been a favorable shift in mix of earning assets as the company continues to experience net loan growth 
loan growth was primarily funded through existing liquidity and the maturity of investment securities

loans as a percent of average earning assets increased to for the year  compared to for the comparable period of at december   this percentage had decreased to  primarily a result of a million loan sale consummated in november 
loan growth has occurred in all loan categories during the last three quarters of with the exception of residential family 
the decline in residential family was a result of the high level of refinancing activity that occurred in fixed rate loan production was generated from the refinancing activity and sold in the secondary market 
the loan sale increased short term liquidity and will be used to fund future loan growth 
management anticipates moderate to strong loan production during the first quarter of in the majority of its markets 
although management is continually evaluating alternative sources of revenue  lending is a major component of the company s business and is key to profitability 
while management strives to identify opportunities to increase loans outstanding and enhance the portfolio s overall contribution to earnings  it can do so only by adhering to sound lending principles applied in a prudent and consistent manner 
thus  management will not relax its underwriting standards in order to achieve designated growth goals

allowance for loan losses management maintains the allowance for loan losses at a level sufficient to provide for the estimated credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
credit losses arise from the borrowers inability and willingness to repay  and from other risks inherent in the lending process including collateral risk  operations risk  concentration risk and economic risk 
as such  all related risks of lending are considered when assessing the adequacy of the loan loss reserve 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision charged to expense 
loans are charged against the allowance when management believes collection of the principal is unlikely 
the allowance for loan losses is based on management s judgment of overall loan quality 
this is a significant estimate based on a detailed analysis of the loan portfolio 
the balance can and will change based on changes in the assessment of the portfolio s overall credit quality 
management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis 
loans that have been identified as impaired are reviewed for adequacy of collateral  with a specific reserve assigned to those loans when necessary 
impaired loans are defined as those in which the full collection of principal and interest in accordance with the contractual terms is improbable 
impaired loans generally include those that are past due for days or more and those classified as doubtful in accordance with the company s risk rating system 
loans classified as doubtful have a high possibility of loss  but because of certain factors that may work to strengthen the loan  its classification as a loss is deferred until a more exact status may be determined 
not all loans are considered in the review for impairment  only loans that are for business purposes exceeding  are considered 
the evaluation is based on current financial condition of the borrower or current payment status of the loan 
the method used to assign a specific reserve depends on whether repayment of the loan is dependent on liquidation of collateral 
if repayment is dependent on the sale of collateral  the reserve is equivalent to the recorded investment in the loan less the fair value of the collateral after estimated sales expenses 
if repayment is not dependent on the sale of collateral  the reserve is equivalent to the recorded investment in the loan less the estimated cash flows discounted using the loan s effective interest rate 
the discounted value of the cash flows is based on the anticipated timing of the receipt of cash payments from the borrower 
the reserve allocations assigned to impaired loans are sensitive to the extent market conditions or the actual timing of cash receipts change 
once specific reserves have been assigned to impaired loans  general reserves are assigned to the remaining portfolio 
general reserves are assigned to commercial purpose loans exceeding  that are not impaired  but that have weaknesses requiring closer management attention 
general reserves are also assigned to commercial purpose loans exceeding  that do not exhibit weaknesses requiring closer monitoring 
finally  general reserves are assigned to large groups of smaller balance homogenous loans  including commercial purpose loans less than  consumer loans  credit card loans and residential mortgage loans 
large commercial purpose loans exhibiting specific weaknesses are detailed in a monthly problem loan report 
these loans are divided into ten different pools based on various risk characteristics and the underlying value of collateral taken to secure specific loans within the pools 
these classified loans are monitored for changes in risk ratings that are assigned based on the bank s asset classification policy  and for the ultimate disposition of the loan 
the ultimate disposition may include upgrades in risk ratings  payoff of the loan  or charge off of the loan 
this migration analysis results in a charge off ratio by loan pool of classified loans that is applied to the balance of the pool to determine general reserves for specifically identified problem loans 
this charge off ratio is adjusted for various environmental factors including past due and nonperforming trends in the loan portfolio  the micro and macro economic outlook  and credit administration practices as determined by independent parties 
general reserves are assigned to large commercial purpose loans exceeding  that do not exhibit weaknesses and pools of smaller balance homogenous loans based on calculated overall charge off ratios over the past three years 
the charge off ratios applied are adjusted as detailed above  with further consideration given to the highest charge off experience of the bank dating back to the last national recession 
the allowance for loan losses is compared against the sum of the specific reserves assigned to problem loans plus the general reserves assigned to pools of loans that are not specific problem loans 
adjustments are made when appropriate 
an unallocated reserve is reflected in as a result of a change in policy regarding the methodology of calculating a required reserve 
in previous years  the allowance for loan losses was compared to the highest end of a range of required calculated reserves 
this year  a most likely reserve value was determined within the computed range of required calculated reserve  with the actual allowance for loan losses compared to the most likely reserve value 
the unallocated reserve is monitored on a regular basis and adjusted based on qualitative factors

while there can be no assurance that the company will not sustain loan losses in a particular period that are substantial in relation to the size of the allowance  management s assessment of the loan portfolio would not indicate a likelihood of this occurrence 
it is management s opinion that the allowance at december  is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio at year end 
table provides an allocation of the allowance for loan losses to specific loan types for each of the past five years 
the reserve allocations  as calculated using the above methodology  are assigned to specific loan categories corresponding to the type represented within the components discussed 
the greatest losses experienced by the company have occurred in the consumer loan portfolio  including credit cards 
as such  the greatest amount of the allowance is allocated to consumer loans despite its relatively small balance 
management is making changes in the underwriting of consumer loans throughout the company and in the management of the credit card portfolio in an effort to reduce the charge offs associated with consumer purpose loans 
risk element assets risk element assets consist of nonaccrual loans  renegotiated loans  other real estate  loans past due days or more  potential problem loans and loan concentrations 
table depicts certain categories of the company s risk element assets as of december for each of the last five years 
potential problem loans and loan concentrations are discussed within the narrative portion of this section 
the company s nonperforming loans increased  or  from a level of million at december   to million at december  during  loans totaling approximately million were added  while loans totaling million were removed from nonaccruing status 
of the million removed   consisted of principal reductions  million represented loans transferred to other real estate  million consisted of loans brought current and returned to an accrual status and loans refinanced  and  was charged off 
where appropriate  management has allocated specific reserves to absorb anticipated losses 
the majority of the company s charge offs in were in the consumer portfolio where loans are charged off based on past due status and are not recorded as nonaccruing loans 
approximately of the company s nonaccrual loans are secured by family residential properties or residential lots 
these loans are believed to have little exposure to credit loss as evidenced by the relatively small amount of charge offs experienced in nonaccrual loans 
the housing markets in the areas served by the company continue to be strong despite the general decline in the economy 
all nonaccrual loans exceeding  not secured by family residential properties are reviewed quarterly for impairment 
loans are considered impaired when it is probable that all principal and interest will not be collected according to the contractual terms 
when a loan is considered impaired  it is reviewed for exposure to credit loss 
if credit loss is probable  a specific reserve is allocated to absorb the anticipated loss

nonperforming assets loans plus other real estate 




nonperforming assets capital reserve nonperforming loans for computation of this percentage  capital refers to shareowners equity plus the allowance for loan losses 
interest on nonaccrual loans is generally recognized only when received 
cash collected on nonaccrual loans is applied against the principal balance or recognized as interest income based upon management s expectations as to the ultimate collectibility of principal and interest in full 
if interest on nonaccruing loans had been recognized on a fully accruing basis  interest income recorded would have been  higher for the year ended december restructured loans are those with reduced interest rates or deferred payment terms due to deterioration in the financial position of the borrower 
other real estate totaled million at december   versus million at december  this category includes property owned by capital city bank which was acquired either through foreclosure procedures or by receiving a deed in lieu of foreclosure 
during  the company added properties totaling million  and partially or completely liquidated properties totaling million  resulting in a net decrease in other real estate of approximately  management does not anticipate any significant losses associated with other real estate 
potential problem loans are defined as those loans which are now current but where management has doubt as to the borrower s ability to comply with present loan repayment terms 
potential problem loans totaled million at december  the increase in past due loans was due to one relationship which subsequently has been brought to a current status 
loan concentrations are considered to exist when there are amounts loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar activities which cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions and such amounts exceed of total loans 
due to the lack of diversified industry within the markets served by the bank and the relatively close proximity of the markets  the company has both geographic concentrations as well as concentrations in the types of loans funded 
furthermore  due to the nature of the company s markets  a significant portion of the portfolio has historically been secured with real estate 
while the company has a majority of its loans secured by real estate  the primary type of real estate collateral is family residential properties 
at december   approximately of the portfolio consisted of real estate loans 
residential properties comprise approximately of the real estate portfolio 
the real estate portfolio  while subject to cyclical pressures  is not typically speculative in nature and is originated at amounts that are within or below regulatory guidelines for collateral values 
management anticipates no significant reduction in the percentage of real estate loans to total loans outstanding 
management is continually analyzing its loan portfolio in an effort to identify and resolve its problem assets as quickly and efficiently as possible 
as of december   management believes it has identified and adequately reserved for such problem assets 
however  management recognizes that many factors can adversely impact various segments of its markets  creating financial difficulties for certain borrowers 
as such  management continues to focus its attention on promptly identifying and providing for potential losses as they arise 
investment securities in  the company s average investment portfolio decreased million  or  from and million  or  from compared to as a percentage of average earning assets  the investment portfolio represented in  compared to in in both years  the decline in the portfolio was attributable to the maturities of investment securities in all categories  which in anticipation of future loan growth  were not replaced during the period 
in december  some liquidity was invested into the securities portfolio  with plans of investing more in early in  liquidity levels will be closely monitored to determine if additional investments should be purchased 
in  average taxable investments decreased million  or  while tax exempt investments decreased million  or 
although the tax reform act of significantly reduced the tax benefits associated with tax exempt securities  management will continue to purchase bank qualified municipal issues when it considers the yield to be attractive and the company can do so without adversely impacting its tax position 
as of december   the company may purchase additional tax exempt securities without adverse tax consequences 
the investment portfolio is a significant component of the company s operations and  as such  it functions as a key element of liquidity and asset liability management 
as of december   all securities are classified as available for sale 
classifying securities as available for sale offers management full flexibility in managing its liquidity and interest rate sensitivity without adversely impacting its regulatory capital levels 
securities in the available for sale portfolio are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses associated with these securities recorded  net of tax  in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss component of shareowners equity 
at december   shareowners equity included a net unrealized gain of million  compared to a gain of million at december  it is neither management s intent nor practice to participate in the trading of investment securities for the purpose of recognizing gains and therefore the company does not maintain a trading portfolio

the company experienced a steep decline in certificates of deposit beginning in the second quarter of and continuing through average certificates of deposit as a percent of average total deposits have declined from in to in this was primarily a result of increased competition and the relative low level of interest rates 
this decline was partially offset by growth of nonmaturity deposits which created a favorable shift in the deposit mix and a positive impact on the bank s cost of funds 
deposits may continue to decline slightly during the first quarter primarily as a result of continued run off in the certificate of deposit portfolio

management monitors the company s financial position in an effort to ensure the company has ready access to sufficient liquid funds to meet normal transaction requirements  take advantage of investment opportunities and cover unforeseen liquidity demands 
in addition to core deposit growth  sources of funds available to meet liquidity demands include cash received through ordinary business activities ie  collection of interest and fees  federal funds sold  loan and investment maturities  bank lines of credit for the company  approved lines for the purchase of federal funds by ccb and federal home loan bank advances 
the company ended with approximately million in liquidity generated through million in borrowings advanced from the federal home loan bank and the million loan sale in november 
liquidity is expected to decline as the company purchases investment securities and funds loan growth 
as of december   the company had a million credit facility under which all the funds were currently available 
the facility offers the company an unsecured  revolving line of credit for a period of three years which matures in november upon expiration of the revolving line of credit  the outstanding balance may be converted to a term loan and repaid over a period of seven years 
the term loan is to be secured by stock of a subsidiary bank equal to at least of the principal balance of the term loan 
the company  at its option  may select from various loan rates including prime  libor or the lenders cost of funds rate cof  plus or minus increments thereof 
the libor or cof rates may be fixed for a period of up to six months 
the company also has the option to select fixed rates for periods of one through five years 
as of december   the company did not have any debt outstanding on the line of credit 
the company s credit facility imposes certain limitations on the level of the company s equity capital  and federal and state regulatory agencies have established regulations which govern the payment of dividends to a bank holding company by its bank subsidiaries 
as of year end  the company was in compliance with all of these contractual and or regulatory requirements 
a further discussion of the company s credit facility can be found in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
at december   the company had million in long term debt outstanding to the federal home loan bank of atlanta 
the debt consists of loans 
the interest rates are fixed and the weighted average rate at december  was 
required annual principal reductions approximate million  with the remaining balances due at maturity ranging from to during the third quarter  the company borrowed million from the federal home loan bank to fund the recent growth in loan demand and the continued decline in certificates of deposit 
the borrowing consists of four separate advances with maturities ranging from to months and a weighted average rate of 
of this amount  million was classified as long term 
the remaining long term debt consists of million used to match fund longer term  fixed rate loan products  which management elected not to fund internally from an asset liability perspective 
the debt is secured by family residential mortgage loans 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information as to the company s long term debt 
the company does not currently engage in the use of derivative instruments to hedge interest rate risks 
however  the company is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risks in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
at december   the company had million in commitments to extend credit and million in standby letters of credit 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer so long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
the company uses the same credit policies in establishing commitments and issuing letters of credit as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
if commitments arising from these financial instruments continue to require funding at historical levels  management does not anticipate that such funding will adversely impact its ability to meet on going obligations 
in the event these commitments require funding in excess of historical levels  management believes current liquidity  available lines of credit from the federal home loan bank  investment security maturities and the company s million credit facility provide a sufficient source of funds to meet these commitments 
it is anticipated capital expenditures will approximate million over the next twelve months 
the capital expenditures are expected to consist primarily of five new offices in existing markets  office equipment and furniture  and technology purchases 
management believes these capital expenditures can be funded internally without impairing the company s ability to meet its on going obligations

the ratio of shareowners equity to total assets at year end was  and  in  and  respectively 
the company is subject to risk based capital guidelines that measure capital relative to risk weighted assets and off balance sheet financial instruments 
capital guidelines issued by the federal reserve board require bank holding companies to have a minimum total risk based capital ratio of  with at least half of the total capital in the form of tier capital 
as of december   the company exceeded these capital guidelines with a total risk based capital ratio of and a tier ratio of  compared to and  respectively  in in addition  a tangible leverage ratio is now being used in connection with the risk based capital standards and is defined as tier capital divided by average assets 
the minimum leverage ratio under this standard is for the highest rated bank holding companies which are not undertaking significant expansion programs 
an additional to may be required for other companies  depending upon their regulatory ratings and expansion plans 
on december   the company had a leverage ratio of compared to in see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information as to the company s capital adequacy 
at december   the company s common stock had a book value of per diluted share compared to in beginning in  book value has been impacted by the net unrealized gains and losses on investment securities available for sale 
at december   the net unrealized gain was million compared to a net unrealized gain in of million 
the current unrealized gain is a result of the decline in interest rates over the past two years 
on march   the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of its outstanding common stock 
the purchases will be made in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
the company acquired  shares during and  shares during on january   the company s board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional  shares of its outstanding common stock 
from march  through february   the company repurchased  shares at an average purchase price of per share 
the company offers an associate incentive plan under which certain associates are eligible to earn shares of ccbg stock based upon achieving established performance goals 
in  the company issued  shares  valued at approximately  under this plan 
the company also offers stock purchase plans at a reduced price to its associates and directors 
in   shares  valued at approximately  were issued under these plans 
the board of directors approved a dividend reinvestment and optional stock purchase plan for the company in december in and  shares for this plan were purchased in the open market  and thus there were no newly issued shares under this plan 
the company offers a k plan which enables associates to defer a portion of their salary on a pre tax basis 
the plan covers substantially all of the company s associates who meet the minimum age requirement 
the plan is designed to enable participants to elect to have an amount withheld from their compensation in any plan year and placed in the k plan trust account 
matching contributions from the company can be made up to of the participant s compensation 
during and  no contributions were made by the company 
the participants may choose to invest their contributions into fifteen investment funds  including ccbg common stock 
the purchase of ccbg common stock is strictly voluntary  and there are no restrictions on the sale of ccbg common stock held in the k plan 
dividends adequate capital and financial strength is paramount to the stability of the company and its subsidiary bank 
cash dividends declared and paid should not place unnecessary strain on the company s capital levels 
when determining the level of dividends the following factors are considered 
compliance with state and federal laws and regulations  
the company s capital position and its ability to meet its financial obligations  
projected earnings and asset levels  
the ability of the bank and ccbg to fund dividends 
although a consistent dividend payment is believed to be favorably viewed by the financial markets and shareowners  the board of directors will declare dividends only if the company is considered to have adequate capital 
future capital requirements and corporate plans are considered when the board considers a dividend payment 
dividends declared and paid totaled 
per share in during the fourth quarter of the quarterly dividend was raised from 
per share to 
per share 
the company declared dividends of 
per share in and 
per share in the dividend payout ratio was  and for  and  respectively 
dividends declared per share in represented a increase over inflation the impact of inflation on the banking industry differs significantly from that of other industries in which a large portion of total resources are invested in fixed assets such as property  plant and equipment 
assets and liabilities of financial institutions are virtually all monetary in nature  and therefore are primarily impacted by interest rates rather than changing prices 
while the general level of inflation underlies most interest rates  interest rates react more to changes in the expected rate of inflation and to changes in monetary and fiscal policy 
net interest income and the interest rate spread are good measures of the company s ability to react to changing interest rates and are discussed in further detail in the section entitled earnings analysis 
other prior to  capital city bank maintained several relationships with various independent service organizations isos in connection with its card processing operations 
during late and early  a small number of one of the iso s merchants generated a large amount of charge backs 
the bank and the iso were previously named defendants in one merchant lawsuit citing the improper use of merchant reserve balances 
that lawsuit was dismissed 
while no outstanding litigation currently exists  the bank may be exposed to litigation in the future 
management does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these issues will have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
the bank no longer maintains merchant service relationships with these isos 
accounting policies critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  which require the company to make various estimates and assumptions see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that  of its significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is established through a charge to the provision for loan losses 
provisions are made to reserve for estimated losses in loan balances 
the allowance for loan losses is a significant estimate and is evaluated quarterly by the company for adequacy 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce a different required allowance  and thereby a larger or smaller provision recognized as expense in any given reporting period 
a further discussion of the allowance for loan losses can be found in the section entitled allowance for loan losses and note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
intangible assets intangible assets consist primarily of goodwill and core deposit assets that were recognized in connection with various acquisitions 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the fair market value of their identifiable net assets 
the company performs an impairment review on an annual basis to determine if there has been impairment of its goodwill 
the company has determined that no impairment existed at december  impairment testing requires management to make significant judgments and estimates relating to the fair value of its identified reporting units 
significant changes to these estimates may have a material impact on the company s reported results 
core deposit assets represent the premium the company paid for core deposits 
core deposit intangibles are amortized on the straight line method over various periods ranging from years  with the majority being amortized over approximately years 
generally  core deposits refer to nonpublic  nonmaturing deposits including noninterest bearing deposits  now  money market and savings 
the company makes certain estimates relating to the useful life of these assets  and rate of run off based on the nature of the specific assets and the customer bases acquired 
if there is a reason to believe there has been a permanent loss in value  management will assess these assets for impairment 
any changes in the original estimates may materially affect reported earnings

 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others the interpretation  which addresses the disclosure to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees 
the interpretation also requires the recognition of a liability by a guarantor at the inception of certain guarantees 
the interpretation requires the guarantor to recognize a liability for the non contingent component of the guarantee  this is the obligation to stand ready to perform in the event that specified triggering events or conditions occur 
the initial measurement of this liability is the fair value of the guarantee at inception 
the recognition of the liability is required even it is not probable that payments will be required under the guarantee or if the guarantee was issued with a premium payment or as part of a transaction with multiple elements 
the company has adopted the disclosure requirements of the interpretation in note and will apply the recognition and measurement provisions for all guarantees entered into or modified after december  to date  the company has not entered into or modified any guarantees pursuant to the provisions of the interpretation

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk overview market risk management arises from changes in interest rates  exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the company has risk management policies to monitor and limit exposure to market risk and does not actively participate in exchange rates  commodities or equities 
in asset and liability management activities  policies are in place that are designed to minimize structural interest rate risk 
interest rate risk management the normal course of business activity exposes ccbg to interest rate risk 
fluctuations in interest rates may result in changes in the fair market value of the company s financial instruments  cash flows and net interest income 
ccbg s asset liability management process manages the company s interest rate risk 
the financial assets and liabilities of the company are classified as other than trading 
an analysis of the other than trading financial components  including the fair values  are presented in table this table presents the company s consolidated interest rate sensitivity position as of year end based upon certain assumptions as set forth in the notes to the table 
the objective of interest rate sensitivity analysis is to measure the impact on the company s net interest income due to fluctuations in interest rates 
the asset and liability values presented in table may not necessarily be indicative of the company s interest rate sensitivity over an extended period of time 
the company is currently liability sensitive  which generally indicates that  in a period of rising interest rates  the net interest margin will be adversely impacted as the velocity and or volume of liabilities being repriced exceeds assets 
the opposite is true in a falling rate environment 
however  as general interest rates rise or fall  other factors such as current market conditions and competition may impact how the company responds to changing rates and thus impact the magnitude of change in net interest income 
nonmaturity deposits offer management greater discretion as to the direction  timing and magnitude of interest rate changes and can have a material impact on the company s interest rate sensitivity 
in addition  the relative level of interest rates as compared to the current yields rates of existing assets liabilities can impact both the direction and magnitude of the change in net interest margin as rates rise and fall from one period to the next
