table of contents in august  webmethods acquired active software  inc active in a transaction that was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
we have combined our financial statements for prior periods as if the merger had occurred at the beginning of all prior periods presented 
fiscal year overview we decreased our net loss to million in our fiscal year ended march   from million in the previous year 
our net loss of million included a negative foreign currency impact of approximately  during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended march   we achieved profitability with quarterly net income of  while our total revenue increased slightly  to million for fiscal year from for fiscal year  our ability to increase software license revenue  our principal source of revenue  continued to be impacted by the economic downturn and reduced information technology spending 
in fiscal year  license revenue decreased by million to million  which was a significantly smaller decrease than in fiscal year  when license revenue decreased by million to million 
many enterprises continue to be cautious  and information technology it purchases are subjected to more rigorous internal reviews and approvals which often result in longer sales cycles  the postponement of it projects or customers placing smaller orders 
we maintained our intense focus on expense management throughout fiscal year this resulted in a reduction from fiscal year in total sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative expenses  in all cases excluding stock based compensation and warrant charge  as applicable 
in october  we reduced our headcount by approximately  or 
we sell our integration platform to global customers through our direct sales force augmented by system integrators  our relationships with application software partners  and to a lesser extent  resellers 
we license our software to customers primarily on a perpetual basis and to a lesser extent  on a renewable term basis 
as of march   we had over customers  compared to over customers as of march  we believe one of our competitive differentiators is our strong partnership with application software companies and system integrators 
under our partnerships with application software vendors  the partner may resell or embed our software with their applications under limited use licenses for a license or royalty fee 
leading enterprise application software vendors with whom we have strong relationships include broadvision  i technologies  jd edwards  sap ag and siebel systems 
our application and system integrator partners actively assist us in selling the full webmethods integration platform to their customers  making us the logical choice for enterprise wide integration initiatives 
we believe our partners influenced  directly or indirectly  a substantial portion of our license revenue during fiscal year  and we expect this leverage to continue 
under certain partnership arrangements  we may share license fees derived from joint selling opportunities with our partner 
in other partnership arrangements  we may pay a sales assistance fee to a partner who performs or assists in certain sales activities  and that fee usually is paid once payment from the joint customer of license fees is received 
during fiscal year  we expanded our partnership with informatica to make business activity monitoring more easily attainable and announced our integration of the jboss application server directly into the webmethods integration platform 
we believe our strong focus and track record of ensuring that our software is successfully put into production production event is a strong competitive advantage and differentiator 
during fiscal year  our global customer services group reported and documented over separate production events as compared to such events in the prior year 
in many instances during fiscal year  these customers deployed our software within weeks or less 
ensuring that our customers successfully implement our software in a timely manner enables them to achieve a greater return on their investment and  in many cases  encourages them to purchase additional software for other integration projects and serve as a reference customer for us in our future sales efforts 

table of contents we believe the software integration market will continue to provide opportunity for long term growth 
our focus on customer success and satisfaction has resulted in an increasing number of referenceable customers and productions events 
over of our license revenue in fiscal year came from our existing customers 
we strive to provide the most comprehensive integration platform available  and will continue to invest to ensure an advantageous positioning relative to our competition resulting in recognized industry and technology leadership and increasing market share 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosures 
we evaluate our estimates  on an on going basis  including those related to allowances for bad debts  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ for these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we enter into arrangements  which may include the sale of licenses of our software  professional services and maintenance or various combinations of each element 
we recognize revenue based on statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended  and modified by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
sop modified sop by requiring revenue to be recognized using the residual method if certain conditions are met 
revenue is recognized based on the residual method when an agreement has been signed by both parties  the fees are fixed or determinable  collection of the fees is probable  delivery of the product has occurred  vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for any undelivered element  and no other significant obligations remain 
revenue allocated to the undelivered elements is deferred using vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the elements and the remaining portion of the fee is allocated to the delivered elements generally the software license 
see note in the consolidated financial statements for a more comprehensive discussion of our revenue recognition policies 
judgments we make regarding these items  including collection risk  can materially impact the timing of recognition of license revenue  especially for perpetual software licenses 
policies related to revenue recognition require difficult judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple sources of authoritative guidance 
these sources may publish new authoritative guidance which might impact current revenue recognition policies 
we continue to evaluate our revenue recognition policies as new authoritative interpretations and guidance are published  and where appropriate  may modify our revenue recognition policies 
application of our revenue recognition policy requires a review of our license and professional services agreements with customers and may require management to exercise judgment in evaluating whether delivery has occurred  payments are fixed and determinable  collection is probable  and where applicable  if vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for undelivered elements of the contract 
in the event judgment in the application of our revenue recognition policies is incorrect  the revenue recognized by webmethods could be impacted 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses which may result from the inability of our customers to make required payments to us 
these allowances are established through analysis of 
table of contents the credit worthiness of each customer with a receivable balance  determined by credit reports from third parties  published or publicly available financial information  customers specific experience including payment practices and history  inquiries  and other financial information from our customers 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce materially different allowance balances 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
at march  and  the allowance for doubtful accounts was  and  respectively 
goodwill and intangibles assets we record goodwill and intangible assets when we acquire other companies 
the allocation of acquisition cost to intangible assets and goodwill involves the extensive use of management s estimates and assumptions  and the result of the allocation process can have a significant impact on our future operating results 
financial accounting standards board no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  which was issued during fiscal year and adopted by us on april   eliminated the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their useful lives while goodwill and indefinite lived assets are not amortized under sfas  but are periodically tested for impairment 
in accordance with sfas  all of our goodwill is associated with our corporate reporting unit  as we do not have multiple reporting units 
on an annual basis  we will evaluate whether an impairment of the goodwill may exist 
goodwill is tested for impairment using a two step process 
the first step is to identify a potential impairment and the second step measures the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
goodwill is deemed to be impaired if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value 
see recently issued accounting pronouncements  for more information 
foreign currency effects the functional currency for our foreign operations is the local currency 
the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries have been translated into united states dollars 
asset and liability accounts have been translated using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date 
revenue and expense accounts have been translated using the average exchange rate for the period 
the gains and losses associated with the translation of the financial statements resulting from the changes in exchange rates from period to period have been reported in other comprehensive income or loss 
to the extent assets and liabilities of the foreign operations are realized or the foreign operations are expected to pay back the intercompany debt in the foreseeable future  amounts previously reported in other comprehensive income or loss would be included in net income or loss in the period in which the transaction occurs 
transaction gains or losses  other than intercompany debt deemed to be of a long term nature  are included in net income or loss in the period in which they occur 
accounting for income taxes we have recorded a tax valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is expected to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made

some of the software licenses granted by us contain provisions that indemnify licensees of our software from damages and costs resulting from claims alleging that the our software infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party 
we have historically received only a limited number of requests for indemnification under these provisions and have not been required to make material payments pursuant to these provisions

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks  including changes in interest rates affecting the return on our investments and foreign currency fluctuations 
we have established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk 
we maintain our funds in money market accounts  corporate bonds  commercial paper  and us government agency securities 
our exposure to market risk due to fluctuations in interest rates relates primarily to our interest earnings on our cash deposits 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk inasmuch as their fair value will fall if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from the levels prevailing as of march   the fair value of the portfolio would not decline by a material amount 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to mitigate risks 
however  we do have an investment policy that would allow us to invest in short term and long term investments such as money market instruments and corporate debt securities 
our policy attempts to reduce such risks by typically limiting the maturity date of such securities to no more than twenty four months with a maximum average maturity to our whole portfolio of such investments at twelve months  placing our investments with high credit quality issuers and limiting the amount of credit exposure with any one issuer 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
our exposure to market risk due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to the intercompany balances with our subsidiaries located in australia  united kingdom  france  germany  japan  the netherlands  korea  hong kong and singapore 
transaction gains or losses have not been significant in the past  and there is no hedging activity on foreign currencies 
we would not experience a material foreign exchange loss based on a hypothetical adverse change in the price of the euro  great britain pound  singapore dollar  australian dollar  or yen against the us dollar 
consequently  we do not expect that a reduction in the value of such accounts denominated in foreign currencies resulting from even a sudden or significant fluctuation in foreign exchange rates would have a direct material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
notwithstanding the foregoing  the direct effects of interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on the value of certain of our investments and accounts  and the indirect effects of fluctuations in foreign currency could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for example  international demand for our products is affected by foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  interest rate fluctuations may affect the buying patterns of our customers 
furthermore  interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations have broad influence on the general condition of the us foreign and global economics  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition results of operations and cash flows
