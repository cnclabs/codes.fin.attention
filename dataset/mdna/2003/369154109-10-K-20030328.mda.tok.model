during  gbc continued to evaluate its organization and created two new business groups commercial and consumer ccg and industrial and print finishing ipfg 
the ccg was created through the combination of the former document finishing and office products groups and is responsible for marketing the company s binding  laminating  visual display writing boards  bulletin boards  easels  etc  and other products for use by consumers and commercial customers 
the ipfg  which is comprised of the former films group and what was the automated products division of the document finishing group  targets print for pay and other finishing customers who use gbc s professional grade finishing equipment and supplies 
gbc s internal management reporting was not modified in to reflect the new business groups  therefore  the company s segment reporting continues to be p resented based upon four primary disagregated business groups document finishing  films  office products and europe 
the groups revenues are primarily derived from office products group products customers channels visual display products indirect desktop binding and laminating machines binding and laminating supplies desktop accessories and document shredders document finishing group products customers channels binding and punching equipment direct approximately binding supplies indirect approximately custom and stock binders and folders maintenance and repair services films group products customers channels thermal and pressure sensitive laminating films primarily direct mid range and commercial high speed laminators large format digital print laminators europe group products customers channels the europe group distributes the office products and document finishing group s products to customers in europe indirect approximately direct approximately the office product group s products are sold through indirect channels including office products superstores  contract commercial stationers  wholesalers  mail order  and retail dealers

between and  gbc grew rapidly through a series of acquisitions 
while the acquired entities contributed a significant amount of revenue to gbc  they also added significant new infrastructure and high debt levels 
further  integration of the acquisitions proved more difficult than management expected 
recognizing these issues  in  the company began implementation of a multi phase process with the goal of returning gbc to long term profitability 
the first phase of the program included rationalization of sku s and facilities  as well as headcount reductions

this program is based upon a continuous improvement process which uses the principles of simplification  segmentation and intense focus 
the goals of this program include a focusing on greater profitability and long term revenue growth  b streamlining and improving worldwide infrastructure  and c generating cash to increase financial flexibility 
the program has produced positive results in and is expected to continue with further operational and financial improvements in  although there can be no assurance that such improvement will continue and to what extent 
the savings from this program have helped to offset the effect of a challenging sales environment  fund investments related to new sales  marketing and product development initiatives  and reduce the company s debt levels

the remainder of the decline was in supply items which were affected by the company s prior decision to reduce the compensa tion of its sales force for supply sales 
the films group s sales decreased by million or in the decrease was primarily due to lower sales of commercial laminating films to the group s north america publishing industry customers  along with weakness in the group s digital print finishing business 
sales to publishing customers were negatively impacted by weak industry demand 
the digital print finishing business was affected by lower spending for advertising  trade shows  and media presentations 
the weakness experienced in the north american publishing and digital print finishing business was somewhat offset by higher sales in the european commercial films business which increased 
net sales in europe  after considering the impact of currency fluctuations  were roughly flat in when compared to the decrease in sales of the other segment was primarily due to currency fluctuations in the asia pacific countries 
gross margins  costs and expenses the company s overall gross profit margin percentage in was compared to in despite significantly reduced manufacturing volumes  and with the exception of the films group  the gross profit margin percentage in each group was flat in compared to this was achieved through continued implementation of supply chain and other cost management programs  along with effective scaling of manufacturing to meet demand

the rate was significantly impacted by restructuring and other special charges incurred in and the relatively low level of pre tax earnings in see note to the consolidated financial statements for more details 
net loss income gbc reported a net loss of million in  or per basic and diluted share compared to net income of million  or per basic and diluted share in the net loss was primarily the result of a the inventory rationalization and write down charges of million  b an increase in restructuring charges of million  c other charges of million 
in addition  in reduced operating income was lower than due to the lower level of sales and gross profit achieved by certain business units 
these items were partially offset in by lower interest expense compared to liquidity and capital resources credit facility management assesses the company s liquidity in terms of its overall debt capacity and ability to generate cash from operations to fund its operating activities  capital needs and debt service requirements 
significant factors affecting liquidity are cash flows generated from operating activities  capital expenditures  interest and debt service requirements  adequate bank lines of credit and financial flexibility to attract long term capital with satisfactory terms 
gbc s primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are internally generated cash flows  and borrowings under gbc s revolving credit facility 
gbc s primary source of liquidity is a multicurrency revolving credit facility established on january  with a group of international financial institutions the facility which was initially amended and restated on november   and further amended and restated on january  gbc reduced the size of the facility through the second amendment and restatement by million  from million to million comprised of a million multicurrency revolving credit facility and term loans totaling million 
the maturity date on approximately million of the facility was extended until january   and the maturity date on approximately million of the term loans was extended to july  the january amendment provided for significantly higher interest rates than those payable under the previous amended and restated facility  a reflection of bank credit market conditions at the time of the amendment and the extended maturity 
interest rates on the facility are variable and are set at libor plus  except for the term loans expiring on july  which carry a rate of libor plus 
gbc has entered into interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of its floating rate interest exposure under the facility related to libor 
as of december   approximately million of borrowings under the facility were hedged 
the one month libor rate at december  was approximately 
a significant increase in libor would result in increased interest expense on the unhedged portion of gbc s floating rate debt 
in december  gbc amended the facility to provide the flexibility to create additional credit facilities with new potential lenders 
the company now has the ability to obtain additional financing by leveraging assets that are not secured by the facility 
the great majority of any proceeds received from any such financing would be used to make additional prepayments on the facility 
during  the company made voluntary prepayments totaling million which reduced the amount outstanding under the term loans that mature on january  also  in december  gbc voluntarily reduced the size of the revolving credit portion of the facility to million from million 
as a result of these actions  the size of the facility at december  was a total of million  and outstanding borrowings at that time totaled million 
under the terms of the facility  the size of the revolving credit portion of the facility will be further reduced to million on july  credit facility financial covenants gbc is subject to certain financial covenants under the facility 
under the most restrictive covenants  gbc must meet certain minimum ebitda as defined below targets  as well as leverage and interest coverage ratios 
in addition  the amount of credit availability is based on a borrowing base comprised of certain of the company s trade receivables and inventory 
there also are restrictions on dividend payments  acquisitions  additional indebtedness  and capital expenditures 
substantially all of the assets of general binding corporation and its domestic subsidiaries remain pledged as collateral  as well as a portion of the equity in certain foreign subsidiaries 
the most restrictive financial covenants under the facility require the company to meet the following targets and ratios minimum ebitda levels ebitda is specifically defined in the facility and relates to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
the facility also provides for the addback of certain expenses defined as programs incurred by the company to execute its operational excellence program 
the facility required that gbc achieve a minimum cumulative trailing four quarter ebitda of million as of the end of each quarter ending march  through september   and requires a minimum of million of ebitda as of the end of each quarter thereafter 
minimum leverage ratios there are two leverage ratio tests under the facility 
these ratios are computed by dividing the cumulative four quarter trailing ebitda as defined under the facility into the company s total debt and its senior debt total debt less subordinated debt 
the facility requires that gbc s leverage ratios as of the end of each quarter be no higher than total debt senior debt q to to q and q to to q to to q to to q and q to to thereafter to to maximum interest coverage ratio interest coverage is defined under the facility as the cumulative trailing four quarter ebitda as defined under the facility divided by interest expense 
as of the end of each quarter  gbc must maintain a ratio higher than to until the maturity date 
as of december  and during the year then ended  gbc was in compliance with all covenants under the facility 
based upon its current financial forecast  the company expects to remain in compliance with the covenants under the facility 
the financial forecast assumes that there will be no further significant deterioration of worldwide economic conditions and that certain objectives of the operational excellence program will be achieved 
if the economic prospects in the markets in which gbc does business and or certain goals and objectives of the operational excellence program are not met  it is possible that the company will fail one or more of its covenants 
in that situation  if gbc were unable to obtain an amendment to the facility or a waiver in the event of a major covenant violation  the company s liquidity would be adversely impacted to a significant degree 
credit facility borrowing base availability the facility includes an million multicurrency borrowing facility that gbc uses to fund its working capital requirements 
the company s borrowing capacity under the facility is limited by a borrowing base  which is specifically defined in the facility and is computed as of eligible trade receivables and of eligible inventory 
eligible receivables are generally defined as current domestic and canadian receivables reduced by certain obligations of the company  and eligible inventory is generally defined as inventory owned by gbc s domestic and canadian operations 
at december   gbc s borrowing base was adequate to support gbc s expected future working capital requirements 
if  however  there were to be a significant deterioration in the quality of gbc s eligible receivables or inventory  there can be no assurance that adequate liquidity would be available under the facility 
credit facility maturity the maturity date on approximately million of the facility is january  the company is currently working with a number of financial institutions to arrange financing to replace the facility on or prior to the january  maturity date 
while management believes it can be successful in obtaining satisfactory financing to replace the facility  there can be no assurance that such financing will be available 
if the company is unable to obtain satisfactory financing to replace the facility it will be forced to adopt alternatives strategies that might include further restructuring  asset sales or seeking additional equity capital 
there can be no assurance that any of these strategies could be effected on satisfactory terms  if at all 
cash flow and other cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for in  net receivables  inventory and accounts payable and accrued liabilities used million in cash  compared to where million was generated 
net income tax refunds of million in  compared to net income tax payments of million in  along with higher segment operating earnings in  partially offset the working capital decrease 
net cash used in investing activities was million during  as compared to million in a reduction in capital expenditures of million from to accounted for most of the change 
net cash used in financing activities was million during  compared to million of cash provided by financing activities during in the latter part of  management increased the company s borrowings under the facility above normal levels to ensure adequate liquidity while finalizing the amendment of the facility 
approximately million of borrowings were repaid in january upon the amendment of the facility 
excluding these additional borrowings at december   gbc would have reported a reduction in debt of approximately million during gbc has been restricted from paying dividends since the amendment and restatement of the facility  and therefore no dividends were paid during  and as a result of recent unfavorable asset returns and a decline in market interest rates  at december  the company recorded a reduction of approximately million to other comprehensive income oci  which is a component of stockholders equity  in order to establish an additional minimum liability for one of its defined benefit pension plans 
this adjustment had no impact on the company s results of operations 
as required by sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  if the accumulated benefit obligation abo relating to a pension plan exceeds the fair value of the plans assets  the company s established liability for the plan must be at least equal to the unfunded abo 
depending on market conditions and interest rate movements in the future  additional charges to oci might be required based on valuations performed at future measurement dates 
based on the most recent valuation of the plan  gbc will be required to make additional annual contributions in the amount of approxim ately million to fund the plan shortfall 
this additional contribution could increase or decrease in future years based upon market conditions 
gbc sources many of its laminating machines from gmp co 
ltd gmp  a company whose manufacturing facility is located in the republic of korea 
gbc also has an equity ownership interest in gmp of approximately 
while gbc has a long term supply contract with gmp  there can be no assurance that gmp will be able to continue to fulfill any or all of its obligations to the company 
gmp s ability to fulfill gbc s requirements for laminating machines could be affected by korean and other regional and worldwide economic  political and governmental conditions 
additionally  gmp has a highly leveraged capital structure 
in order to ensure the continuation of its operations  gmp will need to obtain adequate sources of financing 
there can be no assurance that such financing will continue to be available 
gbc has recently accelerated its payment terms to gmp to provide them with liquidity assistance 
it is not certain if gbc will continue to provide such assistance in the future 
if gmp wer e unable to supply gbc with laminating machines  there are alternative sources available 
however  changing suppliers for the laminating machines manufactured by gmp would require lead times of a duration that could result in a disruption of supply 
if gbc s supply chain were disrupted  the company s results of operations and its financial position would be negatively impacted 
gbc s investment in gmp at december  is approximately million 
if gmp were to fail or be unable to fulfill its obligations to gbc  the company could have to write off all or parts of its investment in gmp 
while such a write off would be non cash in nature  it would negatively impact gbc s ability to remain in compliance with certain financial covenants under the facility 
contractual financial obligations gbc s primary contractual cash obligations consist of principal payments on debt obligations and operating lease obligations 
the table below summarizes gbc s contractual obligations at december  in millions payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt operating leases total excludes related interest 
commercial financial commitments at december   gbc had commercial financial commitments of approximately million consisting of standby letters of credit which primarily support domestic workers compensation claims and a real estate operating lease on one of the company s facilities 
the terms of the letters of credit expire during and early credit concentration gbc has several customers of the office products group which  in the normal course of business  make significant purchases from the company 
trade receivable balances from these customers have ranged from million 
as a result  at any point in time  gbc may have a significant concentration of its accounts receivable balance among this customer group 
to mitigate the credit risk among this group of customers  management closely monitors trends in the office products market  as well as the financial condition and payment trends of these customers 
however  should one or more of those customers fail  such failure could have a material adverse affect on gbc s financial position and results of operations 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk gbc is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates which may affect the results of its operations and financial condition 
gbc seeks to manage these risks through its regular operating and financing activities  and when deemed appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
gbc does not use any derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes and is not a party to any leveraged financial instruments 
the methods used by gbc to assess and mitigate the market risks discussed herein should not be considered projections of future events and exposures 
foreign exchange risk management as a result of gbc s global activities  the company has assets  liabilities  loans and cash flows denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
from time to time  gbc utilizes a foreign exchange risk management program to manage its foreign exchange exposures to help minimize the adverse impact of currency movements 
certain loans and cash flows in the us and in foreign countries are currently hedged through foreign currency forward contracts 
the majority of gbc s exposures to currency movements are in europe  the asia pacific region  canada and mexico  and the significant hedging transactions related to these areas outstanding as of december  are presented below 
all of the outstanding contracts have maturity dates in increases and decreases in the fair market values of the forward agreements are completely offset by changes in the values of the net underlying foreign currency transaction exposures

unrealized gains of approximately million related to hedges of intercompany inventory purchases have been recorded in other comprehensive income 
interest rate risk management as a result of gbc s funding program for its global activities  gbc has various debt obligations that pay interest on the basis of fixed and floating rates 
gbc utilizes an interest rate management program to reduce its exposures to floating interest rates and achieve a desired risk profile 
to accomplish this objective  gbc currently hedges these exposures by using interest rate swap and cap agreements 
the table below provides information about gbc s derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including interest rate swaps  interest rate caps and debt obligations

new accounting standards as of january   the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and sfas no 
accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities 
these statements establish accounting and reporting standards for certain derivative financial instruments and hedging activities including certain derivative instruments imbedded in other contracts and require gbc to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure them at fair market value 
gbc s existing derivative instruments are primarily designated as cash flow hedges to hedge cash flows related to future variable rate interest payments  cash flows in foreign currencies with respect to settlement of intercompany payables by gbc s foreign subsidiaries  and foreign currency cash flows related to the financing of gbc s foreign operations 
gbc implemented both sfas no 
s and as of january  hedge accounting has been applied to all of gbc s derivative instruments except the foreign currency cash flow hedges related to intercompany loans between gbc s foreign and domestic subsidiaries 
the adjustments to gbc s balance sheet and income statement as a result of adopting these standards were not significant 
effective january   gbc has implemented eitf issue no 
accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
this pronouncement specifies when companies are required to record the cost of certain sales incentives and how the costs are to be classified in the income statement 
previously  gbc recorded the costs of such sales incentives as selling expenses in its income statement  these costs are now recorded as a reduction in sales 
the prior year s results have been restated for this change 
there has been no change to operating income as the result of the implementation of this standard  however  operating margins have increased 
effective january   gbc implemented sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
with the adoption of sfas no 
s and  goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its useful life 
rather  goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
under the new rules  an acquired intangible asset would be separately recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights or if the intangible asset can be sold  transferred  licensed  rented  or exchanged  regardless of the acquirer s intent to do so 
implementation of this standard resulted in the elimination of approximately million of amortization expense of goodwill during in addition  gbc recorded a gross goodwill impairment charge of million and an offsetting tax benefit of million in this charge is non cash and has no impact on the company s operations 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no  accounting for costs associated with exit and disposal activities 
this statement revises the accounting for exit and disposal activities under eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity  by spreading out the reporting of expenses related to restructuring activities 
commitment to a plan to exit an activity or dispose of long lived assets will no longer be sufficient to record a one time charge for most anticipated costs 
instead  companies will record exit or disposal costs when they are incurred and can be measured at fair value  and they will subsequently adjust the recorded liability for changes in estimated cash flows 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective prospectively for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  companies may not restate previously issued financial statements for the effect of the provisions of sfas no 
 and liabilities that a company previously recorded under eitf issue are grandfathered 
gbc does not believe that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees of indebtedness of others fin no 

the initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation  which require a guarantor to recognize a liability at the inception of a guarantee at fair value  are effective on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after january  gbc does not believe that the adoption of fin no 
will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock compensation transition and disclosure sfas no 
 which amends sfas no 
the new standard provides alternative methods for transition to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation from the intrinsic method 
gbc currently accounts for stock based employee compensation under the intrinsic method and has not made a determination as to when  or if  the company would change to the fair value based method 
sfas no 
also amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require more prominent and frequent disclosures in financial statements about the effects of stock based compensation 
the required disclosures have been adopted in the company s consolidated financial statements 
related party transactions as discussed in notes and to the consolidated financial statements  gbc and lane industries  inc the company s majority shareholder have entered into tax allocation agreements  which determine gbc s us federal and us state income liabilities 
other related party transactions are detailed in gbc s proxy statement 
no related party transactions had a material impact on gbc s financial position  cash flow  or results of operations 
critical accounting policies the following accounting policies are considered to be critical to the understanding of gbc s financial statements because their application requires management judgement 
the company s reported financial results rely upon estimations and assumptions which are uncertain 
for all of these policies  management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and even the best estimates may require adjustment 
allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns the provision for doubtful accounts is established based upon historical losses on trade receivables  the aging of customer account balances  and the creditworthiness of specific customers 
historically  gbc has not realized significant losses on trade receivables 
as discussed under credit concentration  certain of gbc s customers routinely carry significant trade receivable balances 
deterioration of the creditworthiness of such customers could have a significant negative impact on the financial results of gbc 
an allowance for potential sales returns is established as revenue is recognized 
this allowance is based upon historical trends for specific customer groups 
additionally  the company monitors the sell through information provided by significant resellers of its products 
the allowance is adjusted periodically based upon such information 
management believes that the allowance adequately provides for future returns  however  market changes and customer strategies could impact this estimate in the future 
allowance for slow moving and obsolete inventory gbc s inventory is valued at manufactured cost or purchase cost 
an allowance is established to adjust the cost of inventory to its net realizable value 
the allowance is based upon historical and estimated future sales of specific inventory items 
changes in future demand for products or inaccurate estimates of demand for new products could have a significant impact on the company s allowance 
additionally  a decision by major resellers of gbc s products to no longer carry these products could have a significant impact on the company s future results 
long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets  the company reviews potential impairment of long lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
during and  provisions were established for certain assets impacted by restructuring activities 
during  the company decided to dispose of its investment in an indian joint venture  in which it owned less than interest 
the company recognized a non cash loss of million in connection with this transaction  which is included in other expenses on its statements of income 
in accordance with sfas no 
 gbc tested its goodwill balances to determine whether these assets were impaired 
based upon the testing performed  gbc recorded a non cash impairment charge of million million after tax effective january   primarily related to the impairment of goodwill in the office products group 
the company will perform its annual impairment test at january of each fiscal year 
in addition  sfas no 
also requires that previously recognized intangible assets  other than goodwill  be reassessed to determine the appropriateness of the estimated useful lives of these assets 
intangible assets determined to have finite lives are amortized over those lives and intangible assets that have indefinite lives are not amortized 
as of december   there have been no events or circumstances which would warrant a revision to the remaining useful lives of these assets
