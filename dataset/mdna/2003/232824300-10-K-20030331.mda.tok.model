significant events in in september  in an effort to reduce expenses and position cytogen for stronger long term growth in oncology  we restructured our axcell biosciences subsidiary 
management intends that the plan  which included a reduction of axcell s workforce  will allow continued research related to the role of novel proteins and signal transduction pathways in disease progression through both external collaborations and internal data mining 
while axcell continues to pursue opportunities in the area of signal transduction research  the restructuring reinforces our corporate objectives of developing and marketing oncology products 
in october  we entered into a five year agreement with matritech inc to be the sole distributor for matritech s nmp bladderchek test to urologists and oncologists  in the united states 
retention of exclusivity rights depends upon meeting certain minimum annual purchases 
nmp bladderchek is a point of care test for bladder cancer that requires only a few drops of a patient s urine 
nmp bladderchek returns results in thirty minutes and provides urologists with an adjunct technology to cystoscopy  a clinical procedure for the visual identification of tumors in the bladder  for improved detection and early diagnosis 
during november  we began promoting nmp bladderchek to urologists in the united states  using our in house urologic focused sales force 
on october   upon the receipt of approval of our stockholders at a duly called and held special meeting of stockholders  our board of directors authorized and implemented a reverse stock split of our issued  outstanding and authorized shares of common stock at a ratio of one for ten 
as a result of the reverse split  one new share of common stock was issued for every ten shares of common stock held by stockholders of record as of the close of business on october  the reverse split was intended  in part  to help increase the market price of our common stock above the minimum per share as required by the nasdaq national market s maintenance listing standards

in january  we provided draximage with notice of termination for each of our license and distribution agreement and product manufacturing and supply agreement with respect to both of draximage s brachyseed i and brachyseed pd products 
we launched brachyseed i and brachyseed pd in february and may  respectively 
effective january   we no longer accept or fill new orders for the brachyseed i and brachyseed pd products 
results of operations years ended december   and revenues total revenues were million in  million in and million in the increase in from and was primarily due to higher product related revenues from increased sales of prostascint and brachyseed  partially offset by lower license and contract revenues 
in january  we served notice of termination for each of our license and distribution agreement and product manufacturing and supply agreement with draximage with respect to the brachyseed i and brachyseed pd products 
as a result  effective january   we no longer accept or fill new orders for the brachyseed products 
product related revenues  including product sales and royalty revenues  accounted for  and of revenues in  and  respectively 
license and contract revenues accounted for the remainder of revenues 
product related revenues were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in from and was due primarily to an increase in the sale of prostascint and brachyseed i and pd effective january   we discontinued selling and marketing the brachyseed products 
sales from prostascint were million  million and million in  and  respectively  and accounted for  and of the product related revenues  respectively 
beginning in july  we assumed sole responsibility for selling and marketing prostascint from bard urological division of cr bard inc  our former co marketing partner 
we believe that future growth and market penetrations of prostascint is dependent upon  among other things  the implementation and continued research of new product applications  such as i combining or fusing prostascint with ct computed tomography or mri magnetic resonance imaging scans in a digital overlay fusion imaging  ii using prostascint scans to guide therapy image guided therapy  which is not limited to enhancing the placement of brachytherapy seeds  but can also be applied to cryosurgery and external beam radiation  such as intensity modulated radiation therapy imrt  an advanced and more powerful form of therapy that uses computers to focus radiation more precisely on the target  and iii competitive reimbursement by federal and private agencies 
there can be no assurance  however  that such initiatives will significantly increase the sale of prostascint 
sales of brachyseed were million in  compared to  in and accounted for of product related revenues during  compared to of product related revenues during we launched brachyseed i in february and brachyseed pd in may the increase in over the prior period was due to increased market penetration of brachyseed products  the agreements for which were subsequently terminated as described above 
as a result  effective january   we no longer accept or fill new orders for the brachyseed i and brachyseed pd royalties from quadramet were million  million and million in  and  respectively  and accounted for  and of product related revenues  respectively 
we believe that the future growth and market penetration of quadramet is largely dependent upon  among other things i new clinical data supporting the expanded and earlier use of quadramet in various cancers and in combination with other therapies  such as chemotherapy and bisphophonates  ii establishing the use of quadramet at higher doses to target and treat primary bone cancers  and iii increased marketing and sales penetration to radiation and medical oncologists 
quadramet is currently marketed by our marketing partner  berlex laboratories inc although we believe that berlex is an advantageous marketing partner  there can be no assurance that quadramet will achieve greater market penetration on a timely basis or result in significant revenues for us 
sales from oncoscint cr ov were   and  in  and  respectively 
the market for oncoscint cr ov for diagnosis of colorectal disease has been negatively affected by positron emission tomography or pet scans which have shown the same or higher sensitivity than oncoscint cr ov 
accordingly  we discontinued selling oncoscint at the end of in order to focus on our other oncology products

we began introducing nmp bladderchek to urologists during november effective january   we adopted us securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements sab which requires up front  non refundable license fees to be deferred and recognized over the performance period 
the cumulative effect of adopting sab resulted in a one time  non cash charge of million or per share in  which reflects the deferral of an up front license fee received from berlex  net of associated costs  related to the licensing of quadramet recognized in and a license fee for certain applications of psma to a joint venture formed by cytogen and progenics recognized in previously  we had recognized up front license fees when we had no obligations to return the fees under any circumstances

at this time  advanced magnetics does not intend to develop code for oncology imaging 
costs of product sales were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in from was due primarily to an increase in sales of brachyseed and a  charge to reserve for excess inventory for oncoscint and prostascint  partially offset by lower facility related costs associated with the manufacturing of prostascint 
the decrease in compared to was due primarily to lower manufacturing costs that result from better manufacturing yields for prostascint  partially offset by costs associated with the purchase of brachyseeds  which became commercially available in effective january   we no long accept or fill orders for the brachyseed products

the increase in from and was due primarily to a charge of  related the restructuring of axcell in september  and a stock based compensation charge for a key employee  partially offset by decreased spending in legal and professional fees in insurance reimbursement during  we received a one time payment of  from an insurance claim filed by us in to recover the loss of product resulting from the rupture of a tube during the manufacture of a batch of prostascint

assuming the state of new jersey continues to fund this program  which is uncertain  the actual amount of net operating losses and tax credits we may sell will also depend upon the allocation among qualifying companies of an annual pool established by the state of new jersey 
because the market value of our common stock held by non affiliates of the company is less than million  we are ineligible to utilize a registration statement on form s for primary offerings in which our common stock is offered for cash on our behalf 
we cannot guarantee you that the market value of our common stock held by non affiliates will ever increase above million  and as a result  that we will thereby regain eligibility to utilize a form s registration statement for such primary offerings

as of march   the parties are in the process of negotiating the annual budget for the joint venture and have agreed that the operating budget for will be no less than the operating expenses for the joint venture

our capital and operating requirements may change depending upon various factors  including i whether we and our strategic partners achieve success in manufacturing  marketing and commercialization of our products  ii the amount of resources which we devote to clinical evaluations and the expansion of marketing and sales capabilities  iii results of clinical trials and research and development activities  and iv competitive and technological developments  in particular  we expect to incur significant costs for the development of our psma technologies 
our financial objectives are to meet our capital and operating requirements through revenues from existing products and licensing arrangements 
to achieve our strategic objectives  we may enter into research and development partnerships and acquire  in license and develop other technologies  products or services 
certain of these strategies may require payments by us in either cash or stock in addition to the costs associated with developing and marketing a product or technology 
however  we believe that  if successful  such strategies may increase long term revenues 
there can be no assurance as to the success of such strategies or that resulting funds will be sufficient to meet cash requirements until product revenues are sufficient to cover operating expenses  if ever 
to fund these strategic and operating activities  we may sell equity or debt securities as market conditions permit or enter into credit facilities 
we have incurred negative cash flows from operations since our inception  and have expended  and expect to continue to expend in the future  substantial funds to implement our planned product development efforts  including acquisition of products and complementary technologies  research and development  clinical studies and regulatory activities  and to further our marketing and sales programs 
we expect that our existing capital resources should be adequate to fund our operations and commitments into the first quarter of we cannot assure you that our business or operations will not change in a manner that would consume available resources more rapidly than anticipated 
we expect that we will have additional requirements for debt or equity capital  irrespective of whether and when we reach profitability  for further product development costs  product and technology acquisition costs  and working capital 
our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on numerous factors  including i the successful commercialization of our products  ii the costs associated with the acquisition of complementary products and technologies  iii progress in our product development efforts and the magnitude and scope of such efforts  iv progress with clinical trials  v progress with regulatory affairs activities  vi the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  vii competing technological and market developments  and viii the expansion of strategic alliances for the sales  marketing  manufacturing and distribution of our products 
to the extent that the currently available funds and revenues are insufficient to meet current or planned operating requirements  we will be required to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financing  strategic alliances with corporate partners and others  or through other sources 
there can be no assurance that the financial sources described above will be available when needed or at terms commercially acceptable to us 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  further scale back or eliminate certain aspects of our operations or attempt to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  product candidates  products or potential markets 
if adequate funds are not available  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be materially and adversely affected 
critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
note to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k includes a summary of our significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the following is a brief discussion of the more significant accounting policies and methods used by us 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of our products upon shipment 
we do not grant price protection to customers 
quadramet royalties are recognized when earned 
the securities and exchange commission has issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  which provides guidance on the recognition of up front  non refundable license fees 
accordingly  we defer up front license fees and recognize them over the estimated performance period of the related agreement  when we have continuing involvement 
since the term of the performance periods is subject to management s estimates  future revenues to be recognized could be affected by changes in such estimates 
accounts receivable our accounts receivable balances are net of an estimated allowance for uncollectible accounts 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while we believe our reserve estimate to be appropriate  we may find it necessary to adjust our allowance for uncollectible accounts if the future bad debt expense exceeds our estimated reserve 
we are subject to concentration risks as a limited number of our customers provide a high percent of total revenues  and corresponding receivables 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  as determined using the first in  first out method  which most closely reflects the physical flow of our inventories 
our products and raw materials are subject to expiration dating 
we regularly review quantities on hand to determine the need for reserves for excess and obsolete inventories based primarily on our estimated forecast of product sales 
our estimate of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated our reserve for excess and obsolete inventories 
carrying value of fixed and intangible assets our fixed assets and certain of our acquired rights to market our products have been recorded at cost and are being amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of those assets 
if indicators of impairment exist  we assess the recoverability of the affected long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets can be recovered through undiscounted future operating cash flows 
if impairment is indicated  we measure the amount of such impairment by comparing the carrying value of the assets to the present value of the expected future cash flows associated with the use of the asset 
adverse changes regarding future cash flows to be received from long lived assets could indicate that an impairment exists  and would require the write down of the carrying value of the impaired asset at that time 
during  we recorded a non cash charge of million to impairment of intangible assets  which represents the write off of the carrying value of the licensing fees associated with brachyseed i and brachyseed pd  as the carrying value will not be recoverable 
in october  we entered into a five year agreement with matritech inc to be the sole distributor for matritech s nmp bladderchek point of care test to urologists and oncologists in the united states 
retention of exclusivity rights depends upon meeting certain minimum annual purchases 
we paid matritech  upon the execution of the agreement  which was recorded as other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet for the respective period and is being amortized over the five year estimated performance period of the agreement 
we determined that we did not have any impairment regarding matritech s license fee at december  commitments as outlined in notes  and of the notes to our consolidated financial statements  we have entered into various contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  less than to to after contractual obligation year years years years total long term debt   capital lease obligations    facility leases     other operating leases    manufacturing and research and development contracts      minimum royalty payments      total      in addition to the above  we are obligated to make certain royalty payments based on sales of the related product and certain milestone payments if our collaborative partners achieved specific development milestones or commercial milestones as outlined in notes and of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
in subsequent periods  we expect to provide funding for the development of the psma technologies through our joint venture with progenics at even higher levels than the current year 
such funding amount may vary dependent upon  among other things  the results of the clinical trials and research and development activities  competitive and technological developments  and market opportunities 
recently enacted accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board isssued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for exit or disposal activities 
sfas addresses significant issues regarding the recognition  measurement and reporting of costs associated with exit and disposal activities  including restructuring activities

sfas is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not have operations subject to risks of foreign currency fluctuations  nor do we use derivative financial instruments in our operations or investment portfolio 
as of december   the company had million of debt outstanding with a fixed interest rate of 
we do not have exposure to market risks associated with changes in interest rates  as we have no variable interest rate debt outstanding 
changes in interest rates could expose us to market risk associated with a fixed interest rate debt 
we do not believe that this note will have material exposure to market risks associated with interest rates
