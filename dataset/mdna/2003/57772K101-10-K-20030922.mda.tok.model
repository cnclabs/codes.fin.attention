item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies 
dependence on new products and process technologies the company s future success will continue to depend on its continued ability to introduce new products and to develop new process technologies 
semiconductor design and process technology are subject to rapid technological change  requiring a high level of expenditures for research and development 
design and process development for the portions of the semiconductor market in which the company participates are particularly challenging 
the success of new product introductions is dependent on several factors  including proper new product selection  timely product introduction  achievement of acceptable production yields  and market acceptance 
from time to time  maxim has not fully achieved its new product introduction and process development goals 
there can be no assurance that the company will successfully develop or implement new process technologies or that new products will be introduced on a timely basis or receive substantial market acceptance 
in addition  the company s growth is dependent on its continued ability to penetrate new markets where the company has limited experience and competition is intense 
there can be no assurance that the markets being served by the company will grow for example  older markets do saturate and decline  that the company s existing and new products will meet the requirements of such markets  that the company s products will achieve customer acceptance in such markets  that competitors will not force prices to an unacceptably low level or take market share from the company  or that the company can achieve or maintain profitability in these markets 
manufacturing risks the fabrication of integrated circuits is a highly complex and precise process 
minute impurities  contaminants in the manufacturing environment  difficulties in the fabrication process  defects in the masks used in the wafer manufacturing process  manufacturing equipment failures  wafer breakage  or other factors can cause a substantial percentage of wafers to be rejected or numerous dice on each wafer to be nonfunctional 
the company has from time to time experienced lower than expected production yields and reliability problems  which have delayed product shipments and adversely affected gross margins 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience a decrease in manufacturing yields or reliability problems  or that the company will be able to maintain acceptable manufacturing yields and reliability in the future 
the number of shippable dice per wafer for a given product is critical to the company s results of operations 
to the extent the company does not achieve acceptable manufacturing yields or experiences delays in its wafer fabrication  assembly or final test operations  its results of operations could be adversely affected 
during periods of decreased demand  fixed wafer fabrication costs could have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition  gross margins  and results of operations 
the company is currently in the process of upgrading and expanding certain of its wafer manufacturing capacity at its existing wafer manufacturing facilities in order to convert to eight inch wafers and develop new processes  which are necessary for the successful entry into significantly large markets  in anticipation of increased customer demand for its products 
should the company be unsuccessful in completing this expansion on time or should customer demand fail to increase and the company no longer needs the additional capacity  the company s financial position and results of operations could be adversely impacted 
the company manufactures approximately of its wafer production requirements internally 
given the nature of the company s products  it would be very difficult and costly to arrange for independent manufacturing facilities to supply such products 
any prolonged inability to utilize one of the company s manufacturing facilities as a result of fire  natural disaster  unavailability of electric power or otherwise  would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
competition the company experiences intense competition from a number of companies  some of which have significantly greater financial  manufacturing  and marketing resources than the company and some of which have greater technical resources than the company and have intellectual property rights to which the company is not privy 
to the extent that the company s proprietary products become more successful  competitors will offer second source products for some of those products  possibly causing some erosion of profit margins 
see item  business competition 
dependence on independent distributors and sales representatives a significant portion of the company s sales is realized through independent electronics distributors and a limited portion of the company s sales is realized through independent sales representatives that are not under the control of the company 
dallas semiconductor continues to have a larger percentage of their sales through the distribution channel than the maxim only business 
these independent sales organizations generally represent product lines offered by several companies and thus could reduce their sales efforts applied to the company s products or terminate their representation of the company 
payment terms for foreign distributors are substantially longer  either according to contract or by practice  than for us customers 
the company generally requires foreign distributors to provide a letter of credit to the company in an amount equal to the credit limit set for accounts receivable from such foreign distributors 
the letter of credit provides for collection on accounts receivable from the foreign distributor should the foreign distributor default on their accounts receivable to the company 
the company does not require letters of credit from any of its domestic distributors and is not protected against accounts receivable default or bankruptcy by these distributors 
the inability to collect open accounts receivable could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
termination of a significant distributor  whether at the company s or the distributor s initiative  could be disruptive to the company s current business 
if the company were unable to find suitable replacements  terminations by significant distributors or representatives could have a material adverse impact on the company 
see item  business sales and marketing 
dependence on independent foundries  subcontractors  thailand test facility and philippines test and shipping facility although the company has an internal capability to fabricate most of its wafers  maxim remains dependent on outside silicon foundries for a small but important portion of its wafer fabrication 
none of the foundries currently used by maxim is affiliated with maxim 
as is typical in the semiconductor industry  from time to time  the company has experienced disruptions in the supply of processed wafers from these foundries due to quality problems  failure to achieve satisfactory electrical yields  and capacity limitations 
procurement from foundries is done by purchase order and contracts 
if these foundries are unable or unwilling to produce adequate supplies of processed wafers conforming to the company s quality standards  the company s business and relationships with its customers for the limited quantities of products produced by these foundries would be adversely affected 
finding alternate sources of supply or initiating internal wafer processing for these products would not be economically feasible 
maxim relies on assembly subcontractors located in the philippines  malaysia  thailand  hong kong  singapore  taiwan and south korea to separate wafers into individual integrated circuits and package them 
the company performs wafer sort operations for about half of its wafers and final testing for about two thirds of its products at a philippines facility owned by the company 
during fiscal year  the company transferred a significant portion of the testing of dallas semiconductor product to the company s test facility located in cavite  the philippines 
in the past  south korea and the philippines have experienced political disorders  labor disruptions  and natural disasters 
although the company has been affected by these problems  none has materially affected the company s revenues or costs to date 
however  similar problems in the future or more aggravated consequences of current problems  could affect deliveries to maxim of assembled  tested product  possibly resulting in substantial delayed or lost sales and or increased expense 
the thailand test facility performs less than one third of the company s final testing for its products but would not provide sufficient capacity to make up for a significant disruption in the philippines test facility 
reliability problems experienced by the company s assemblers could cause serious problems in delivery and quality resulting in potential product liability to the company 
the company performs substantially all of its final testing at its facilities in the philippines and thailand 
given the nature of the company s test operations  it would be very difficult and costly to arrange for independent testing facilities to supply such test services 
any prolonged inability to utilize one of the company s testing facilities as a result of fire  natural disaster  unavailability of electric power or otherwise  would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
as previously noted  once testing has been completed on the company s product  finished product from the company s test facility located in samutprakarn province  thailand is shipped to the company s finished goods location at its test facility in cavite  the philippines 
finished product is either shipped directly from cavite  the philippines to customers worldwide or to other company locations for sale to end customers or distributors 
see item  business manufacturing 
should there be disruption for any reason to the shipping operations in cavite  the philippines  the company might not be able to meet its revenue plan in the fiscal period impacted 
failure to meet the revenue plan may materially adversely impact the company s results of operations 
availability and quality of materials  supplies  and subcontract services the semiconductor industry has experienced a very large expansion of fabrication capacity and production worldwide over time 
as a result of increasing demand from semiconductor manufacturers  availability of certain basic materials and supplies  such as polysilicon  silicon wafers  ultra pure metals  lead frames and molding compounds  and of subcontract services  like epitaxial growth and ion implantation and assembly of integrated circuits into packages  have from time to time  over the past few years  been in short supply and may be expected to come into short supply again if overall industry demand increases in the future 
maxim devotes continuous efforts to maintain availability of all required materials  supplies  and subcontract services 
however  maxim does not have long term agreements providing for all of these materials  supplies  and services  and shortages could occur as a result of capacity limitations or production constraints on suppliers that could have a materially adverse effect on maxim s ability to achieve its planned production 
a number of dallas semiconductor products  including nonvolatile static random access memory products srams  real time clocks  and ibutton tm products use components such as static memory circuits  batteries  pc boards  and crystals that are purchased from third parties 
the company anticipates that from time to time supplies of these components may not be sufficient to meet all customer requested delivery dates for products containing the components 
as a result of any such shortages  future sales and earnings from products using these components could be adversely affected 
additionally  significant fluctuations in the purchase price for these components could affect gross margins for the products involved 
suppliers could also discontinue the manufacture of such purchased products or could have quality problems that could affect the company s ability to meet customer commitments 
quality problems experienced by suppliers could be impossible to reproduce or detect in a controlled environment  or could inadvertently not be detected by the company s quality control procedures 
should this occur  such defects may become part of the company s finished product which would ultimately be sold to customers 
if such defects cause quality control problems in the manufacture of customers end products or cause direct or indirect damages to either the company s customers or the ultimate end users  the company may be liable for increased production costs at its customers and both direct and indirect damages caused by the defective products 
such liability could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operation and financial condition 
in addition  suppliers of semiconductor manufacturing equipment are sometimes unable to deliver test and or fabrication equipment to a schedule or equipment performance specification that meets the company s requirements 
delays in delivery of equipment needed for planned growth could adversely affect the company s ability to achieve its manufacturing and revenue plans in the future 
protection of proprietary information the company relies upon both know how and patents to develop and maintain its competitive position 
there can be no assurance that others will not develop or patent similar technology or reverse engineer the company s products or that the confidentiality agreements upon which the company relies will be adequate to protect its interests 
other companies have obtained patents covering a variety of semiconductor designs and processes  and the company might be required to obtain licenses under some of these patents or be precluded from making and selling the infringing products  if such patents are found to be valid 
there can be no assurance that maxim would be able to obtain licenses  if required  upon commercially reasonable terms 
see item  business patents  licenses  and other intellectual property rights  and item  trends  risks and uncertainties intellectual property litigation and claims 
intellectual property litigation and claims the company is subject to various legal proceedings see item  legal proceedings and other similar claims that involve possible infringement of patent or other intellectual property rights of third parties 
maxim is currently a defendant in a lawsuit brought by linear technology corporation in which linear alleges that maxim has willfully infringed linear technology corporation s patent relating to control circuits and methods for maintaining high efficiencies over broad current ranges in a switching regulator circuit 
linear technology corporation seeks unspecified actual and treble monetary damages and a permanent injunction against maxim 
in addition to the above  from time to time  the company receives notices that its products or processes may be infringing the intellectual property rights of others 
see item  business patents  licenses  and other intellectual property rights 
if one or more of the company s products or processes were determined to infringe any such intellectual property rights  a court might enjoin the company from further manufacture and or sale of the affected products 
the company would then need to obtain a license from the holders of the rights and or to reengineer the company s products or processes in such a way as to avoid the alleged infringement 
in any of those cases  there can be no assurance that the company would be able to obtain any necessary license on commercially reasonable terms or that the company able to reengineer its products or processes to avoid infringement 
an adverse result in litigation arising from such a claim could involve an injunction to prevent the sales of a material portion of the company s products  a reduction or the elimination of the value of related inventories  and the assessment of a substantial monetary award for damages related to past sales which could have a material adverse effect on the company s result of operations and financial condition 
insurance the company has insurance contracts with independent insurance companies that provide certain of its employees with health medical and dental benefits  long term disability income coverage  life insurance coverage  and fiduciary insurance coverage for employees and company funds invested under the employee retirement income and security act 
the company also has insurance contracts with independent insurance companies that provide coverage related to certain property insurance  employee  third party liability  worker s compensation insurance  and automobile insurance 
the company is self insured with respect to medical benefits for most of its domestic united states employees subject to stop loss insurance limitations 
in addition  the company has insurance contracts that provide officer and director liability coverage for the company s officers and directors 
other than the specific areas mentioned above  the company is self insured as it relates to most other risks and exposures 
based on management s assessment and judgment  the company has determined that it is more cost effective to self insure these risks than to incur the insurance premium costs 
the risks and exposures the company self insures include  but are not limited to  fire  property and casualty  natural disaster  product defects  political risk  general liability  patent infringement  and employment issues 
should there be catastrophic loss from events such as fires  explosions  or earthquakes  among many other risks  or adverse court or similar decisions in any area in which the company is self insured  the company s financial condition  results of operations  and liquidity may be materially adversely affected 
see item  legal proceedings 
customer supply agreements the company enters into contracts with certain customers whereby the company commits to supply quantities of specified parts at a predetermined scheduled delivery date 
should the company be unable to supply the customer with the specific part at the quantity and product quality desired at the scheduled delivery date  the customer may incur additional production costs 
in addition  the customer may incur lost revenues due to a delay in receiving the parts necessary to have the end product ready for sale to its customers or due to product quality issues which may arise 
under the customer supply agreements  the company may be liable for direct additional production costs or lost revenues 
the company tries to limit such liabilities 
however  if products were not shipped on time  the company may be liable for damages 
such liability  should it arise  may have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operation and financial condition 
foreign trade and currency exchange many of the materials and manufacturing steps in the company s products are supplied by foreign companies or by the company s operations abroad  such as its test operations in the philippines and thailand 
approximately of the company s net revenues in fiscal year were from foreign customers 
accordingly  both manufacturing and sales of the company s products may be adversely affected by political or economic conditions abroad 
in addition  various forms of protectionist trade legislation are routinely proposed in the united states and certain foreign countries 
a change in current tariff structures or other trade policies could adversely affect the company s foreign manufacturing or marketing strategies 
currency exchange fluctuations could also increase the cost of components manufactured abroad and the cost of the company s products to foreign customers or decrease the costs of products from the company s foreign competitors 
although export sales are subject to government regulation  those regulations have not caused the company significant difficulties to date 
see item  business manufacturing  and item  business sales and marketing 
dependence on key personnel the company s success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of its president  john f 
gifford  its other executive officers  and key management and technical personnel  particularly its experienced engineers and business unit managers  and on its ability to continue to attract  retain  and motivate qualified personnel 
the competition for such employees is intense 
the loss of the services of mr 
gifford or several of the company s executive officers could have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  there could be a material adverse effect on the company should the turnover rates for engineers and other key personnel increase significantly or should the company be unable to continue to attract qualified personnel 
the company does not maintain any key person life insurance policy on any of its officers or employees

maxim integrated products  inc et al  in the federal district court for the northern district of california 
on june   a complaint was filed by linear technology corporation ltc naming the company and certain other unrelated parties as defendants 
the complaint alleges that each of the defendants  including the company  has willfully infringed  induced infringement and contributorily infringed ltc s united states patent  relating to control circuits and methods for maintaining high efficiencies over broad current ranges in a switching regulator circuit  all of which has allegedly damaged ltc in an unspecified amount 
the complaint further alleges that the company s actions have been  and continue to be  willful and deliberate and seeks a permanent injunction against the company as well as unspecified actual and treble damages including costs  expenses  and attorneys fees 
the company answered the complaint on october   denying all of ltc s substantive allegations and counterclaiming for a declaration that ltc s patent is invalid and not infringed 
on september   the federal district court for the northern district of california issued an order dismissing the patent litigation action by ltc 
the court found that the company did not infringe any of the claims of the asserted patent 
the company had moved for summary judgment on a number of subjects  including noninfringement  invalidity and unenforceability of the patent 
the court found that the company s remaining summary judgment motions were rendered moot by its noninfringement ruling 
ltc has appealed the decision 
maxim filed a cross appeal in response to ltc s appeal 
appellate briefs have been filed by both maxim and ltc 
the company filed its reply brief on april  and its response brief on june  while the company continues to believe the claims are without merit  no assurance can be given as to the outcome of the appeal 
the company does not believe that the ultimate outcome of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the financial position or liquidity of the company 
if  however  the appellate court in the action brought by ltc were to reverse the trial court s dismissal of the patent litigation claims brought by ltc against the company  and were ltc to prevail in its claims against the company  the company s operating results could be materially adversely affected

the company s products include data converters  interface circuits  microprocessor supervisors  operational amplifiers  power supplies  multiplexers  delay lines  real time clocks  microcontrollers  switches  battery chargers  battery management circuits  rf circuits  fiber optic transceivers  sensors  and voltage references 
the company is a global company with manufacturing facilities in the united states  testing facilities in the philippines and thailand  and sales offices throughout the world 
the company s products are sold to customers in numerous markets  including automotive  communications  consumer  data processing  industrial control  and instrumentation 
critical accounting policies the methods  estimates and judgments the company uses in applying its most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results the company reports in its financial statements 
the securities and exchange commission has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and require the company to make its most difficult and subjective accounting judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  the company s most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition and accounts receivable allowances  which impacts the recording of revenues  valuation of inventories  which impacts costs of goods sold and gross margins  the assessment of recoverability of long lived assets  which impacts write offs of fixed assets  accounting for income taxes  which impacts the income tax provision  and assessment of contingencies  which impacts charges recorded in cost of goods sold and selling  general and administrative expenses 
these policies and the estimates and judgments involved are discussed further below 
the company has other key accounting policies that either do not generally require estimates and judgments that are as difficult or subjective  or it is less likely that such accounting policies would have a material impact on the company s reported results of operations for a given period 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable allowances revenue from product sales to the company s direct customers is recognized upon shipment  provided that persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable  title has transferred  collection of resulting receivables is reasonably assured  there are no customer acceptance requirements  and there are no remaining significant obligations 
a portion of the company s sales is made to domestic distributors under agreements that provide the possibility of certain sales price rebates and limited product return privileges 
given the uncertainties associated with the levels of returns and other credits that will be issued to these distributors  the company defers recognition of such sales until the product is sold by the domestic distributors to their end customers 
the company estimates the provision for returns and price rebates based on historical experience and known future returns and price rebates 
revenue on all shipments to international distributors is recognized upon shipment to the distributor  when the above criteria are met  with appropriate provision of reserves for returns and allowances  as these distributors generally do not have price rebate or product return privileges 
accounts receivable from both domestic and international distributors are recognized and inventory is relieved upon shipment as title to inventories generally transfers upon shipment at which point the company has a legally enforceable right to collection under normal terms 
the company must make estimates of potential future product returns and sales allowances related to current period product revenue 
management analyzes historical returns  changes in customer demand  and acceptance of products when evaluating the adequacy of sales returns and allowances 
estimates made by the company may differ from actual product returns and sales allowances 
these differences may materially impact reported revenue and amounts ultimately collected on accounts receivable 
in addition  the company monitors collectibility of accounts receivable primarily through review of the accounts receivable aging 
when facts and circumstances indicate the collection of specific amounts or from specific customers is at risk  the company assesses the impact on amounts recorded for bad debts and  if necessary  will record a charge in the period such determination is made 
to date  the company has not experienced material write offs of accounts receivable due to uncollectibility 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost  which approximates actual cost on a first in first out basis  or market value 
because of the cyclicality of the market  inventory levels  obsolescence of technology  and product life cycles  the company writes down inventories to net realizable value based on backlog  forecasted product demand  and historical sales levels 
backlog is subject to revisions  cancellations  and rescheduling 
actual demand and market conditions may be lower than those projected by the company 
this difference could have a material adverse effect on the company s gross margin should inventory write downs beyond those initially recorded become necessary 
alternatively  should actual demand and market conditions be more favorable than those estimated by the company  gross margin could be favorably impacted 
during fiscal year  the company had inventory write downs of million due to decreases in backlog and forecasted demand due to a downturn in certain industry segments particularly telecom and information technology businesses and the general economy 
during fiscal year  the company had inventory write downs of million due primarily to work in process and finished goods inventory manufactured in excess of forecasted demand 
the company s standard cost revision policy is to continuously monitor manufacturing variances and revise standard costs when necessary 
the company s policy for recording a write down of inventory is generally to write down  at standard cost  finished goods inventory in excess of estimated demand based on backlog  historical sales levels and forecasted demand and work in process that is greater than days old  which has no forecasted product demand 
long lived assets the company evaluates the recoverability of property  plant and equipment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company performs periodic reviews to determine whether facts and circumstances exist that would indicate that the carrying amounts of property  plant and equipment might not be fully recoverable 
if facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of property  plant and equipment might not be fully recoverable  the company compares projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their estimated remaining useful life against their respective carrying amounts 
in the event that the projected undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets  the assets are written down to their estimated fair values based on the expected discounted future cash flows attributable to the assets 
evaluation of impairment of property  plant and equipment requires estimates in the forecast of future operating results that are used in the preparation of the expected future undiscounted cash flows 
actual future operating results and the remaining economic lives of the company s property  plant and equipment could differ from the company s estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets 
these differences could result in additional impairment charges  which could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations 
in fiscal year  the company recorded a charge of million for the impairment of dallas semiconductor wafer fabrication equipment and test equipment 
the impairment charge was determined based on the difference between the fair value and the carrying value attributable to such assets 
additionally  in fiscal year  the company recorded charges of million to reduce the carrying value of plant and equipment that was abandoned  no longer in use  or whose estimated useful lives were shortened  resulting in accelerated depreciation 
the charges noted above were classified as operating expenses in the consolidated statements of income 
accounting for income taxes the company records a valuation allowance to reduce the net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and practicable tax planning strategies are considered 
in the event it is determined that the deferred tax assets to be realized in the future would be in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded 
this adjustment would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should it be determined that all or part of the net deferred tax asset would not be realized in the future  an adjustment to increase the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination would be made 
at june   the company recorded a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax asset of million attributable to the expected tax benefits on gains to be realized from the exercise of stock options  which if and when realized  will be recorded as a credit to additional paid in capital 
on a periodic basis the company evaluates its deferred tax asset balance for realizability 
to the extent the company believes it is more likely than not that some portion of its deferred tax assets will not be realized  the company will increase the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets 
realization of the company s deferred tax assets is dependent primarily upon future us taxable income 
the company s judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions  changes in us or international tax laws and other factors 
these changes  if any  may require possible material adjustments to these deferred tax assets  resulting in a reduction in net income or an increase in net loss in the period when such determinations are made 
contingencies from time to time  the company receives notices that its products or manufacturing processes may be infringing the patent or intellectual property rights of others 
the company periodically assesses each matter in order to determine if a contingent liability in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for contingencies  should be recorded 
in making this determination  management may  depending on the nature of the matter  consult with internal and external legal counsel and technical experts 
based on the information obtained combined with management s judgment regarding all the facts and circumstances of each matter  the company determines whether it is probable that a contingent loss may be incurred and whether the amount of such loss can be estimated 
should a loss be probable and estimable  the company records a contingent loss in accordance with sfas in determining the amount of a contingent loss  the company takes into consideration advice received from experts in the specific matter  current status of legal proceedings  settlement negotiations which may be ongoing  prior case history and other factors 
should the judgments and estimates made by management be incorrect  the company may need to record additional contingent losses that could materially adversely impact the company s results of operations 
alternatively  if the judgments and estimates made by management are incorrect and a particular contingent loss does not occur  the contingent loss recorded would be reversed thus favorably impacting the company s results of operations 
see item  legal proceedings 
results of operations net revenues the company reported net revenues of  million in fiscal year  a increase from net revenues of  million in fiscal year net revenue increased by from the fourth quarter of fiscal year to the first quarter of fiscal year and remained flat during the second and third quarters of fiscal year net revenue increased by from the third to fourth quarter of fiscal year the increase in quarterly net revenue for fiscal year is primarily related to higher unit shipments resulting from the introduction of new proprietary products and increased order rates in the company s already existing proprietary and second source products 
the company reported net revenues of  million in fiscal year  a decrease from net revenues of  million in fiscal year this decrease was primarily related to downturns in certain industry segments particularly telecom and information technology businesses and in the general economy 
this downturn  which began in fiscal year  resulted in sequential quarter over quarter decreases in net revenues through the first quarter of fiscal year order rates stabilized during the first quarter of and throughout fiscal year resulting in net revenues increasing slightly quarter over quarter from the second quarter through the fourth quarter of fiscal year approximately   and of the company s net revenues in fiscal years   and  respectively  were derived from customers located outside the united states  primarily in the pacific rim  europe  and japan 
while the majority of these sales are denominated in us dollars  the company enters into foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate its risks on firm commitments and net monetary assets denominated in foreign currencies 
the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on net revenues and the company s results of operations for fiscal years   and was immaterial

outlook at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal year  backlog shippable within the next months was approximately million compared to million at the end of fiscal year  including approximately million compared to million at the end of fiscal year requested for shipment in the first quarter of fiscal year because the company s backlog of orders at any point is not necessarily based on firm  noncancelable orders and because the company s customers do in fact routinely cancel orders for their own convenience with little notice  backlog has limited value as a predictor of future revenues 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  bookings were approximately million  a increase over the previous quarter s level of million 
turns orders remained high during the fourth quarter of fiscal year at of bookings turns orders are customer orders that are for delivery within the same quarter and may result in revenue within the same quarter if the company has available inventory that matches those orders

as of the date of the filing of this report  the company believes that its net revenues will be higher in the first quarter of fiscal year than in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  but the company does not have sufficient visibility based on current backlog and bookings to make confident predictions for future periods 
financial condition overview total assets increased to  million at the end of fiscal year  up from  million at the end of fiscal year the increase is primarily due to cash generated from operations of million in fiscal and million from employee stock option exercises and stock purchase plan purchases

the company will continue to repurchase its common stock in fiscal year the number of shares to be repurchased and the timing of such repurchases will be based on several factors  including the price of the company s common stock  general market conditions  and other factors
