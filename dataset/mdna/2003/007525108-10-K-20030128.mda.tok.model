table of contents foreign currency gains or losses arise as a result of our operation of european subsidiaries  the functional currencies of which are the euro and british pound sterling 
all monetary assets are recorded in the functional currencies on the financial statements of these subsidiaries 
some us dollar denominated receivables and payables in these subsidiaries offset each other to reduce our exposure to transaction gains and losses 
to the extent that these monetary assets and liabilities do not fully offset each other and the us dollar exchange rate changes with respect to these currencies  transaction gains or losses may result 
for large sales denominated in other currencies  we attempt to implement appropriate hedging strategies 
fiscal year compared to net sales 
net sales decreased during fiscal to million from million in fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to reduced sales of entry level products 
revenue from oems was million or of total revenue for fiscal and million or of total revenue for fiscal oem sales remained relatively flat in fiscal as the decrease in revenue from entry level products was offset by an increase in revenue from our scalar product family 
sales to branded customers decreased in fiscal to million from million in fiscal this decline in branded revenue is primarily due to the shift in sales of small and mid size libraries to oems and current weak market conditions 
this decline was partially offset by an increase in revenue from global services 
two customers accounted for fiscal revenues of million and million 
these same two customers accounted for fiscal revenues of million and million intelligent storage solutions iss  which include elements of our software and connectivity technology and are sold through both branded and oem sales channels  represented of sales in fiscal compared to of sales in fiscal net sales outside the united states accounted for of our net sales in fiscal and of our net sales in fiscal in fiscal  a significant portion of our net sales outside the united states was due to an oem customer for whom we maintain a revolver warehouse outside the united states 
during fiscal  a significant amount of sales to this oem customer shifted to a revolver warehouse within the united states  which caused a decline in non us sales 
cost of sales 
cost of sales was million or of net sales for fiscal compared to million or of net sales for fiscal gross profit margins depend on a number of factors  including customer and product mix  fixed infrastructure costs  price competition and tape drive costs 
our quarterly gross profit margins increased sequentially throughout fiscal year our gross margin in the fourth quarter of this year was million on million of net sales compared to a gross margin of million on million of net sales in the first quarter of this year 
this increase in margin in the fourth quarter was primarily due to a decrease in the percentage of total sales attributable to oems 
oem sales in the fourth quarter were versus of total sales in the first quarter of fiscal additionally  margins have increased as our sales mix has shifted towards iss related revenue 
an increase in fixed costs associated with our investment in our infrastructure  including our global information system and our facilities  has had an offsetting impact to the trend in margin improvement 
we believe gross margin will improve as our product mix continues to become more heavily weighted toward higher margin products that include elements of our proprietary storage management software and connectivity technology 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses were million or of net sales for fiscal compared to million or of net sales for fiscal the dollar and percentage increases are due to continued efforts to expand our sales and services channels to support new product offerings and improve market penetration with our more complex enterprise level products 
our focus on increasing sales of enterprise class products is expected to require continued growth in sales and marketing costs 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million or of net sales for fiscal compared to million or of net sales for fiscal the dollar and percentage increases are due to continued investment in our infrastructure  including our global 
table of contents information system  as well as increases in recession related costs such as bad debt and severance expense 
bad debt expense was million  the majority of which was attributed to a single customer 
we expect slower growth in general and administrative expenses in fiscal research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million or of net sales for fiscal compared to million or of net sales for fiscal the increase in percentage and absolute dollars in fiscal reflects our strategy to maintain heavy investments in software and connectivity product development and relates to added personnel resources and additional spending related to new products 
had our fourth quarter fiscal spending level been consistent during the entire fiscal year  we would have invested approximately million in research and development 
we believe that significant investments in research and development are required to remain competitive and to solidify our market position  and we expect quarterly research and development expenditures during fiscal to continue at levels comparable to the million expended in the last quarter of fiscal further  we believe the potential for growth in the market for storage solutions is sufficient to justify continued expansion in our research and development expenses 
acquisition expenses 
in fiscal  we incurred charges of million for acquired in process research and development and compensation to personnel in connection with our acquisition of v stor 
in fiscal  we incurred a charge reducing gross profit by million for the write off of certain inventory deemed non salable due to the pathlight merger and an accrual for contractual liability to a third party

during fiscal  we did not get the full tax rate benefit relating to our loss because our effective income tax rate was negatively affected by certain non deductible expenses associated with the acquisition of pathlight 
fiscal year compared to net sales 
our net sales of million in fiscal grew by million or over net sales of million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to strong sales growth of faststor and scalar products to oem customers 
total revenue from branded products remained materially consistent with fiscal  however  the mix of branded revenue shifted in towards our larger products 
this shift was consistent with our strategy to move the branded product mix toward larger and more complex solutions and fulfill demand for our smaller products through our oem partners 
revenue from oems was million or of total revenue for fiscal and million or of total revenue for fiscal two oem customers accounted for fiscal revenues of million and million 
in fiscal  sales to a single oem customer accounted for million 

table of contents net sales outside the united states accounted for of our net sales in fiscal and of our net sales in fiscal the increase in net sales outside the united states in fiscal was due to sales to an oem customer for whom we maintain a revolver warehouse outside the united states 
a significant percentage of end user sales from that oem may have been to us customers 
as a result  the total of of us shipments for may have significantly overstated our international end user customer base 
cost of sales

in fiscal  sales and marketing expenses were million or of net sales compared to million or of net sales for fiscal sales and marketing expenses increased in absolute dollars as we continued to launch new products and pursue and penetrate new sales channels

provision benefit for income taxes 
we had a benefit for income taxes of million in fiscal compared to income tax expense of million for fiscal the negative effective tax rate for fiscal included taxes paid in various federal  state and international jurisdictions

in addition  gains on securities transactions in fiscal were included as a component of cash flow provided by operating activities 
inventories have decreased as we have entered into certain vendor managed inventory programs  under which ownership transfers at the time we take possession of inventory in the manufacturing process 
the increase in advanced payments from customers is due to increased sales of service contracts  which are typically billed at the beginning of the contract term and recognized as revenue over the service period

as in fiscal  the increases in service parts for maintenance during fiscal and related to new product offerings as well as maintenance of our increasing installed base of existing solutions 
the increases in inventory during fiscal and were primarily the result of the additional inventory requirements necessary to support our oem customers  new adic branded product launches and sales growth

the following table summarizes our contractual cash commitments as of october  payments due during fiscal years ended october  total thereafter in thousands operating leases credit agreements long term debt total contractual cash obligations as of october   we had a commitment to provide an additional  in capital funding towards a strategic investment we currently hold 
we will invest funds as requested until our remaining commitment is satisfied 
as part of our agreement with a contract manufacturer who builds one of our products  we could find it expedient to pay a fee to gain ownership of certain manufacturing and manufacturing test process information and fixtures 
the payment would allow us to procure certain portions of the supplier s own intellectual property and hardware inventory which could prove helpful if we elected to move production to a different supplier 
the fee started at a maximum of  and decreases by with each production unit purchased until it is reduced to zero 
we would incur no such fees if we continue to purchase from the same supplier  cancel the contract and choose not to purchase the information and hardware  or move production to a supplier with similar test capabilities and robust internal processes 
our fiscal operating expenses could include up to approximately million related to profit incentive and bonus 
this amount is based upon a combination of team member salaries and achievement of company performance goals

during fiscal  we incurred exit costs of  reducing the liability to  at october  our october  balance sheet includes liabilities for our credit agreements  long term debt and anticipated exit costs 
none of the other commitments described above require accrual at october  we had no other material or unusual commitments as of october  we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  available bank lines of credit  debt capacity and anticipated cash flow from our operating activities will be sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next months 
we will continue to evaluate possible acquisitions of  or investments in businesses  products  or technologies that we believe are strategic  which may require the use of cash 
in addition  we have made and expect to continue to make investments in companies with whom we have identified potential synergies

table of contents critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to customer agreements  sales returns  bad debts  inventories  service parts for maintenance  warranty costs  investments  intangible assets  acquired in process technology and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for specifically identified customer agreements  such as special pricing  price protection  stock rotation and volume based incentives  at the time of shipment based upon the expected rate of occurrence 
if market conditions were to decline  we may take actions to enter into more of these agreements  possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered 
we also record an allowance for sales returns for our estimates of expected customer product returns 
should actual return rates differ from our estimates  revisions to our sales return allowance may be necessary 
since we have historically been able to reliably estimate the amount of allowances required for future price adjustments and product returns  we recognize revenue  net of projected allowances  upon shipment to our customers 
if we were unable to reliably estimate the amount of future price adjustments and product returns in any specific reporting period  then we would be required to defer recognition of the revenue until the right to future price adjustments and product returns were to lapse and we were no longer under any obligation to reduce the price or take back the product 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required  and our ability to recognize sales to certain customers may be affected 
we evaluate our inventory and record a provision for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if technology rapidly changes or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
we value our service parts for maintenance at the lower of depreciated cost or market 
depreciation is computed on the straight line method over the estimated useful life of to years depending on the type of service part 
should the technology or our customers service needs change and cause a decrease in the estimated useful lives of service parts  additional write downs of these parts would be required 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
we hold equity interests in both publicly traded and private companies having operations or technology in areas within our strategic focus 
the publicly traded companies may have highly volatile share prices 
we also hold investment grade marketable debt securities in government and commercial 
table of contents entities 
we record an investment impairment charge when we obtain specific information that causes us to believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we would record an impairment charge if we determined that the carrying value of intangibles and goodwill may not be recoverable 
upon implementation of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets at the beginning of fiscal  we will cease to amortize goodwill 
in lieu of amortization  we are required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in fiscal and an annual impairment review thereafter 
the adoption of this statement is not currently anticipated to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
when we enter into a business combination  we record an expense for the value of acquired in process technology that has not reached technological feasibility and has no alternative future use as of the date of acquisition 
the valuation of acquired in process technology is typically based upon our estimates and valuations by a third party appraiser 
we do not currently record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets because we believe that the assets are more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in foreign currency rates and interest rates 
we may enter into various derivative transactions to manage certain of these exposures 
currently  almost three quarters of our total international sales are denominated in us dollars 
the assets and liabilities of our us subsidiaries have functional currencies other than the us dollar and are translated into us dollars at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
a appreciation in the us dollar would have resulted in an approximately  and  decrease in income before benefit for income taxes during fiscal and  respectively 
such a change in income would have resulted from applying a different exchange rate to translate and revalue the financial statements of our non us subsidiaries 
at october   we had variable rate debt of approximately million provided by german banks  and fixed rate debt of million  also provided by a german bank 
the fair value of such debt approximates the carrying amount on the consolidated balance sheet at october  we have entered into an interest rate swap agreement on the variable rate debt  which fixes the interest rate at through november interest on the fixed rate debt is
