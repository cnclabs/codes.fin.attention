reinsurance the company s insurance subsidiaries reinsure portions of the coverages provided by their insurance products with other insurance companies on both an excess of loss and coinsurance basis 
the maximum retention by the company on one individual in the case of life insurance is  the company uses reinsurance for its health insurance business only for limited purposes 
the company does not reinsure any health insurance issued in the self employed market 
reinsurance agreements are intended to limit an insurer s maximum loss 
the ceding of reinsurance does not discharge the primary liability of the original insurer to the insured 
although the company  through coinsurance  assumes risks under policies issued by aegon  and has occasionally used assumption reinsurance to acquire blocks of insurance from other insurers  it does not regularly assume risks of other insurance companies 
see business health insurance coinsurance arrangements 
competition insurance the company operates in highly competitive markets 
the company s insurance subsidiaries compete with large national insurers  regional insurers and specialty insurers  many of which are larger and have substantially greater financial resources or greater claims paying ability ratings than the company 
in addition to claims paying ability ratings  insurers compete on the basis of price  breadth and flexibility of coverage  ability to attract and retain agents and the quality and level of agent and policyholder services provided 
student loans the student loan industry is highly competitive 
the company competes with over  other lenders 
despite the large number of lenders  the top lenders account for approximately of new loan volume 
the company s predominant competitor in the student loan industry is sallie mae  inc the company believes that the volume of new loans originated in would make it one of the top student loan lenders in the company competes by designing and offering an integrated package of government guaranteed and privately guaranteed loan products 
regulatory and legislative matters health care reform  privacy initiatives the health care industry is one of the largest industries in the united states and continues to attract much legislative interest and public attention 
in recent years  an increasing number of legislative proposals have been introduced or proposed in congress and in some state legislatures that would effect major changes in the health care system  either nationally or at the state level 
proposals that have been considered include cost controls on hospitals  insurance market reforms to increase the availability of group health insurance to small businesses  patients bills of rights and requirements that all businesses offer health insurance coverage to their employees 
there can be no assurance that future health care legislation or other changes in the administration or interpretation of governmental health care programs will not have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition or results of operations of the company 
recently adopted legislation and regulations governing the use and security of individuals nonpublic personal data by financial institutions  including insurance companies  will have a significant impact on the company s business and future results of operations 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations privacy initiatives 
insurance regulation the company s insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation in their states of domicile and the other states in which they do business under statutes that typically delegate broad regulatory  supervisory and administrative powers to insurance departments 
the method of regulation varies  but the subject matter of such regulation covers  among other things  the amount of dividends and other distributions that can be paid by the company s insurance subsidiaries without prior approval or notification  the granting and revoking of licenses to transact business  trade practices  including with respect to the protection of consumers  disclosure requirements  privacy standards  minimum loss ratios  premium rate regulation  underwriting standards  approval of policy forms  claims payment  licensing of insurance agents and the regulation of their conduct  the amount and type of investments that the company s insurance subsidiaries may hold  minimum reserve and surplus requirements  risk based capital requirements  and compelled participation in  and assessments in connection with  risk sharing pools and guaranty funds 
such regulation is intended to protect policyholders rather than investors 
the company s insurance subsidiaries are required to file detailed annual statements with the state insurance regulatory departments and are subject to periodic financial and market conduct examinations by such departments 
the most recently completed financial examination for mega in oklahoma mega s domicile state was completed as of and for the three year period ended december  the oklahoma department of insurance is currently conducting a financial examination of mega for the three year period ended december  the most recently completed financial examination for mid west in tennessee mid west s domicile state was completed as of and for the five year period ended december  the most recently completed financial examination for chesapeake in oklahoma chesapeake s domicile state was completed as of and for the three year period ended december  state insurance departments have also periodically conducted and continue to conduct market conduct examinations of uici s insurance subsidiaries 
as of december   either or both of mega and mid west were subject to ongoing market conduct examinations and or open inquiries with respect to marketing practices in ten states 
state insurance regulatory agencies have authority to levy monetary fines and penalties resulting from findings made during the course of such market conduct examinations 
historically  the company s insurance subsidiaries have from time to time been subject to such fines and penalties  none of which individually or in the aggregate have had a material adverse effect on the results of operations or financial condition of the company 
the company provides health insurance products to consumers in the self employed market in states 
a substantial portion of such products is issued to members of various independent membership associations that endorse the products and act as the master policyholder for such products 
the two principal membership associations in the self employed market for which the company underwrites insurance are nase and aas 
the associations provide their membership with a number of endorsed benefits and products  including health insurance underwritten by the company 
subject to applicable state law  individuals generally may not obtain insurance under an association s master policy unless they are also members of the association 
uga agents and cornerstone agents also act as enrollers of new members for the associations  for which the agents receive compensation 
specialized association services  inc a company controlled by the adult children of ronald l 
jensen  the chairman of the company provides administrative and benefit procurement services to the associations  and a subsidiary of the company sells new membership sales leads to the enrollers and video and print services to the associations and to specialized association services  inc see note n of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition to health insurance premiums derived from the sale of health insurance  the company receives fee income from the associations  including fees associated with the enrollment of new members  fees for association membership marketing and administrative services and fees for certain association member benefits 
the agreements with these associations requiring the associations to continue as the master policyholder and to endorse the company s insurance products to their respective members are terminable by the company and the associations upon not less than one year s advance notice to the other party 
recent articles in the popular press have been critical of association group coverage 
in december  the naic convened a special task force to review association group coverage  and the company is aware that selected states are reviewing the laws and regulations under which association group policies are issued 
the company has also recently been named a party to three lawsuits challenging the nature of the relationship between mega and nase  the membership association that has endorsed mega s health insurance products 
see note o of notes to consolidated financial statements 
while the company believes it is providing association group coverage in full compliance with applicable law  changes in the relationship between the company and the membership associations and or changes in the laws and regulations governing so called association group insurance particularly changes that would subject the issuance of policies to prior premium rate approval and or require the issuance of policies on a guaranteed issue basis could have a material adverse impact on the financial condition  results of operations and or business of the company 
many states have also enacted insurance holding company laws that require registration and periodic reporting by insurance companies controlled by other corporations 
such laws vary from state to state  but typically require periodic disclosure concerning the corporation which controls the controlled insurer and prior notice to  or approval by  the applicable regulator of inter corporate transfers of assets and other transactions including payments of dividends in excess of specified amounts by the controlled insurer within the holding company system 
such laws often also require the prior approval for the acquisition of a significant ownership interest eg  or more in the insurance holding company 
the company s insurance subsidiaries are subject to such laws  and the company believes that such subsidiaries are in compliance in all material respects with all applicable insurance holding company laws and regulations 
under the risk based capital initiatives adopted in by the naic  insurance companies must calculate and report information under a risk based capital formula 
risk based capital formulas are intended to evaluate risks associated with asset quality  adverse insurance experience  loss from asset and liability mismatching  and general business hazards 
this information is intended to permit regulators to identify and require remedial action for inadequately capitalized insurance companies but is not designed to rank adequately capitalized companies 
at december   the risk based capital ratio of each of the company s domestic insurance subsidiaries significantly exceeded the ratio for which regulatory corrective action would be required 
the naic revised the accounting practices and procedures manual manual in a process referred to as codification 
the revised manual became effective january  the domiciled states of the company s principal domestic insurance subsidiaries oklahoma and tennessee adopted the provisions of the manual 
the manual changed  to some extent  prescribed statutory accounting practices and resulted in changes to the accounting practices that the company s domestic insurance subsidiaries use to prepare its statutory basis financial statements 
statutory accounting changes adopted to conform to the provisions of the manual are reported as changes in accounting principles in the company s statutory based financial statements 
the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles is reported as an adjustment to unassigned funds surplus in the period of the change in accounting principle 
the cumulative effect is the difference between the amount of statutory capital and surplus at the beginning of the year and the amount of statutory capital and surplus that would have been reported at that date if the new accounting principles had been applied retroactively for all prior periods 
as a result of these changes  the company s domestic insurance subsidiaries reported a change in accounting principle  as an adjustment that increased statutory capital and surplus of million as of january  included in this total adjustment is an increase in statutory capital and surplus of million related to deferred tax assets 
the states in which the company is licensed have the authority to change the minimum mandated statutory loss ratios to which the company is subject  the manner in which these ratios are computed and the manner in which compliance with these ratios is measured and enforced 
loss ratios are commonly defined as incurred claims divided by earned premiums 
most states in which the company writes insurance have adopted the loss ratios recommended by the naic but frequently the loss ratio regulations do not apply to the types of health insurance issued by the company 
the company is unable to predict the impact of i any changes in the mandatory statutory loss ratios for individual or group policies to which the company may become subject  or ii any change in the manner in which these minimums are computed or enforced in the future 
such changes could result in a narrowing of profit margins and have a material adverse effect upon the company 
the company has not been informed by any state that it does not meet mandated minimum ratios  and the company believes that it is in compliance with all such minimum ratios 
in the event the company is not in compliance with minimum statutory loss ratios mandated by regulatory authorities with respect to certain policies  the company may be required to reduce or refund premiums  which could have a material adverse effect upon the company 
the naic and state insurance departments are continually reexamining existing laws and regulations  including those related to reducing the risk of insolvency and related accreditation standards 
to date  the increase in solvency related oversight has not had a significant impact on the company s insurance business 
student loan operations a significant portion of the student loans originated by the company are made under the federal family education loan program ffelp loans  which is subject to periodic legislative reauthorization and interim revision by legislation and regulation 
ffelp loans include federal stafford loans for students and plus loans to parents 
compliance with legal or regulatory restrictions may limit the ability of the company s subsidiaries to conduct their operations 
a failure to comply may subject the affected subsidiary to a loss or suspension of a right to engage in certain businesses or business practices  criminal or civil fines  an obligation to make restitution or pay refunds or other sanctions  which could adversely affect the manner in which the company s subsidiaries conduct their business and the company s results of operations 
state and federal regulation is continually changing and the company is unable to predict whether or when any such changes will be adopted 
it is possible  however  that the adoption of such changes could adversely affect the manner in which the company s subsidiaries conduct their business and the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the federal higher education act of  which authorizes and governs most federal student aid and student loan programs  is subject to review and reauthorization by the recently convened th congress 
congress last reauthorized the higher education act in congress initiated the reauthorization process by holding hearings on reauthorization and higher education finance issues in the fall of it is currently anticipated that additional hearings of various house and senate subcommittees will take place during the balance of  leading to passage of some form of reauthorization bill by the house and senate and signing by the president in late early while the company believes that the higher education act of will in fact be reauthorized  there can be no assurance of the form that reauthorization will take or the changes that the reauthorization bill will bring to the law and regulations governing student finance

sarbanes oxley act of on july   president bush signed into law the public accounting reform and investor protection act of commonly referred to as the sarbanes oxley act of the act 
the stated purpose of the act is to improve the independence and oversight of public accounting firms engaged in practice before the securities and exchange commission  to expand the scope and timeliness of certain public disclosures by reporting companies  to strengthen corporate governance practices by reporting companies  their directors and executive officers and to increase the accountability of directors and executive officers for violations of the securities laws 
the act  together with recent proposals to amend the listing standards imposed by the new york stock exchange  will have a significant impact on the corporate governance obligations of public companies  including uici 
in accordance with section a of the act  the securities and exchange commission adopted rules effective august  requiring an issuer s principal executive officer and financial officer to certify the financial and other information contained in an issuer s quarterly and annual reports 
the newly adopted rules also require these officers to certify that they are responsible for establishing  maintaining and regularly evaluating the effectiveness of the issuer s internal controls  that they have made certain disclosures to the issuer s auditors and the audit committee of the board of directors about the issuer s internal controls  and that they have included information in the issuer s quarterly and annual reports about their evaluation and whether there have been significant changes in the issuer s internal controls or in other factors that could significantly affect internal controls subsequent to the evaluation

results of operations overview set forth below is a discussion of certain general matters affecting the company s historical and future results of operations 
academic management services corp 
for the year ended december   uici s academic management services corp 
subsidiary ams reported operating income of million compared to operating income of million for the year ended december  during  ams benefited from a decrease in operating expenses resulting primarily from a reduction in interest expense on corporate borrowings and increased student loan spread income ie  the difference between interest earned on outstanding student loans and interest expense associated with indebtedness incurred to fund such loans 
these increases in were partially offset by lower realized gains on sale of loans and reduced fee revenue and yields on the trust balances associated with ams tuition installment plan business  in each case as compared to results in the amount of student loan spread income that ams may earn in any period depends in large part upon the level of prevailing market interest rates relative to the prescribed minimum rate that can be earned on ams student loan portfolio 
the benchmark for yields on federally guaranteed student loans is reset annually in accordance with department of education regulations effective july for the succeeding twelve month period 
while yields on student loans are indexed to the day treasury bill rate  the benchmark establishes a floor  below which a lender s yield will not fall during the succeeding twelve month period 
during the first six months of  ams benefited significantly from a favorable prescribed minimum rate earned on its student loan portfolio 
on july   the floor rates on loans made under the federal family education loan program the ffelp loans for the period july  through june  reset basis points lower than the floor rates in effect for the period july  through june  reflecting this downward adjustment on july  to the floor rate on ffelp loans  ams student loan spread income declined significantly from million in the first half of to million in the second half of the year 
on july   the floor rates on ffelp loans for the period july  through june  will again be reset 
based on current prevailing market interest rates  the company currently expects that spread income in will be less than the level of spread income experienced in due to the inherent uncertainty surrounding spread income and the seasonality of its tuition installment business  in any given financial period ams may continue to rely on gains from timely sales of student loans to remain profitable for such period 
ams sold million and million principal amount of student loans during the year ended december  and  respectively  from which ams generated gains on sales in the amount of million and million  respectively

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to health and life insurance claims and reserves  bad debts  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
for a more detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note a of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k  beginning on page f the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
claims reserves the company establishes liabilities for benefit claims that have been reported but not paid and claims that have been incurred but not reported under health and life insurance contracts 
these reserves are developed using actuarial principles and assumptions that consider a number of items  including historical and current claim payment patterns  product variations  the timely implementation of appropriate rate increases and seasonality 
the company uses the developmental method to estimate claims reserves 
this method applies completion factors to paid claims in order to estimate the ultimate claim payments 
these completion factors are derived from historical experience and are dependent on the incurred dates of the paid claims 
the sea division assigns original incurred dates for the paid claims utilized in the estimation of the claim reserves 
this original incurred date technique results in estimating a liability for all medical services related to an accident or illness incurred prior to the end of the period  even though the medical services may not be received by the insured until a later financial reporting period 
in addition to the developmental reserves  various additional claim reserves are estimated as appropriate 
the additional claim reserves estimate liabilities for situations  such as excess pending claims inventory and disputed claims 
the group insurance division assigns incurred dates based on the date of service 
this method estimates the liability for all medical services received by the insured prior to the end of the applicable financial period 
appropriate adjustments are made in the completion factors to account for pending claim inventory changes and contractual continuation of coverage beyond the end of the financial period 
the company estimates the relevant items  based primarily on historical and current data  and uses this information to determine the assumptions underlying its claims reserve calculations 
an extensive degree of judgment is used in this estimation process 
for health care costs payable  the reserve balances and the related benefit expenses are highly sensitive to changes in the assumptions used in the reserve calculations 
with respect to health claims  the items that have the greatest impact on the company s financial results are the medical cost trend  which is the rate of increase in health care costs and the unpredictable variability in actual experience 
any adjustments to prior period reserves are included in the benefit expense of the period in which the need for the adjustment becomes known 
due to the considerable variability of health care costs and actual experience  adjustments to health reserves occur each quarter and are sometimes significant 
accounting for health policy acquisition costs the company incurs various costs in connection with the origination and initial issuance of its health insurance policies  including underwriting and policy issuance costs  costs associated with lead generation activities and distribution costs ie  sales commissions paid to agents 
for financial reporting purposes  underwriting and policy issuance costs with respect to health policies issued through the company s self employed agency and student insurance divisions are expensed as incurred 
costs associated with generating sales leads with respect to the health business issued through the self employed agency division are capitalized and amortized over a two year period  which approximates the average life of a policy 
the company defers the portion of commissions paid to agents and premium taxes with respect to the portion of health premium collected but not yet earned  and the company amortizes the deferred expense over the period as and when the premium is earned 
see note a of notes to consolidated financial statements 
with respect to health policies sold through the company s self employed agency division  commissions paid to agents with respect to first year policies are higher than commissions paid to agents with respect to policies in renewal years 
accordingly  during periods of increasing first year premium revenue such as occurred during  the self employed agency division s overall operating profit margin will be negatively impacted by the higher commission expense associated with first year premium revenue 
the company monitors and assesses the recoverability of capitalized health policy acquisition costs on a quarterly basis 
goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets in june  fasb issued statements no 
 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
statement requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  statement also includes guidance on the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets arising from business combinations completed after june  statement prohibits the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
statement requires that these assets be reviewed for impairment at least annually  or more frequently if certain indicators arise 
the company has determined that it will review goodwill and intangible assets for impairment as of november of each year or more frequently if certain indicators arise 
an impairment loss would be recorded in the period such determination was made 
intangible assets with finite lives will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
statement also requires that goodwill included in the carrying value of equity method investments no longer be amortized 
the company adopted statements and on january  in accordance with statement no 
 the company tested for goodwill impairment effective january  as a result of the transitional impairment testing  completed during the quarter ended june   the company determined that goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition of academic management services corp 
ams and barron risk management services barron was impaired in the aggregate amount of million million net of tax 
the company has reflected this impairment charge in its financial statements as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of january  in accordance with statement no 
on september   the company sold to an unaffiliated third party all of the capital stock of barron  in connection with which for financial reporting purposes the company recognized a nominal gain 
historically  the company generally had amortized the excess of cost over the underlying value of the net assets of companies acquired on a straight line basis over twenty to twenty five years 
the company continually reevaluated the propriety of the carrying amount of goodwill  as well as the amortization period to determine whether current events and circumstances warrant adjustments to the carrying value and or revised estimates of useful life 
the company assessed the recoverability of goodwill based upon several factors  including management s intention with respect to the operations to which the goodwill relates and those operations projected future income and undiscounted cash flows 
an impairment loss would be recorded in the period such determination was made 
at december  and  the company had goodwill in the amount of million and million  respectively  and accumulated amortization of million and million at december  and  respectively  resulting in net goodwill of million and million at december  and  respectively 
the company recorded goodwill amortization expense in continuing operations in the amount of million and million in and  respectively 
at december  and  the company had other intangibles in the amount of million and  respectively  and accumulated amortization of million and at december  and  respectively  resulting in net other intangibles of million and at december  and  respectively 
the company recorded other intangibles amortization expense in continuing operations in the amount of million  and in  and  respectively 
accounting for agent stock accumulation plans the company sponsors a series of stock accumulation plans the agent plans established for the benefit of the independent insurance agents and independent sales representatives associated with uga association field services  new united agency  cornerstone america  guaranty senior assurance  seniorsfirst and cfld association field services 
under eitf accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring or in connection with selling goods and services  the company has established a liability for future unvested benefits under the agent plans and adjusts the liability based on the market value of the company s common stock 
the accounting treatment of the company s agent plans will result in unpredictable stock based compensation charges  dependent upon fluctuations in the quoted price of uici common stock 
these unpredictable fluctuations in stock based compensation charges may result in material non cash fluctuations in the company s results of operations 
see note p of notes to consolidated financial statements 
investments the company has classified its investments in securities with fixed maturities as available for sale 
investments in equity securities and securities with fixed maturities have been recorded at fair value  and unrealized investment gains and losses are reflected in stockholders equity 
investment income is recorded when earned  and capital gains and losses are recognized when investments are sold 
investments are reviewed quarterly to determine if they have suffered an impairment of value that is considered other than temporary 
if investments are determined to be impaired  a loss is recognized at the date of determination 
testing for impairment of investments also requires significant management judgment 
the identification of potentially impaired investments  the determination of their fair value and the assessment of whether any decline in value is other than temporary are the key judgment elements 
the discovery of new information and the passage of time can significantly change these judgments 
revisions of impairment judgments are made when new information becomes known  and any resulting impairment adjustments are made at that time 
the current economic environment and recent volatility of securities markets increase the difficulty of determining fair value and assessing investment impairment 
the same influences tend to increase the risk of potentially impaired assets 
investments are reviewed quarterly or more frequently if certain indicators arise to determine if they have suffered an impairment of value that is considered other than temporary 
management s review considers the following indicators of impairment fair value is significantly below cost  the decline in fair value is attributable to specific adverse conditions affecting a particular investment  the decline in fair value is attributable to specific conditions  such as conditions in an industry or in a geographic area  the decline in fair value has existed for an extended period of time  downgrades by rating agencies from investment grade to non investment grade  the financial condition of the issuer has deteriorated and dividends have been reduced or eliminated or scheduled interest payments have not been made 
management monitors investments where two or more of the above indicators exist and investments are identified by the company in economically challenged industries 
if investments are determined to be impaired  a loss is recognized at the date of determination 
the company seeks to match the maturities of invested assets with the payment of expected liabilities 
by doing this  the company attempts to make cash available as payments become due 
if a significant mismatch of the maturities of assets and liabilities were to occur  the impact on the company s results of operations could be significant 
deferred taxes the company establishes a valuation allowance when management believes  based on the weight of the available evidence  that it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
realization of the net deferred tax asset is dependent on generating sufficient future taxable income 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced 
during the company determined that it was more likely than not that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets 
accordingly  the company eliminated or released the remaining valuation allowance related to the operating loss carryover of ams 
in the event that the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  a valuation allowance would be recorded to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
recording a valuation allowance would result in a charge to income in the period such determination was made 
the company will consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need to record a valuation allowance 
in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
discontinued operations the company has reflected as discontinued operations for financial reporting purposes the results of its former united creditserv sub prime credit card business  its special risk division operations and its uici administrators  inc unit 
the company has established a liability for losses on disposal of the discontinued operations 
the liability for losses on disposal established by the company at december  which is reflected  in the case of united creditserv  in other liabilities on the company s consolidated balance sheet and  in the case of the special risk division and uici administrators  as net liabilities of discontinued operations  including reserve for losses on disposal on the company s consolidated balance sheet represents the company s current estimate of all additional losses including asset write downs  estimated losses on the sale of the business and or the assets and continuing operating losses through the date of sale or shut down that it believes it will incur as part of any sale or shut down of the discontinued operations 
the company regularly monitors and reassesses its estimates for losses on disposal  and if and when such estimates change  the company will make appropriate adjustments to the liability 
loss contingencies the company is subject to proceedings and lawsuits related to insurance claims and other matters 
see note o of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters  as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach  such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
privacy initiatives recently adopted legislation and regulations governing the use and security of individuals nonpublic personal data by financial institutions  including insurance companies  may have a significant impact on the company s business and future results of operations 
gramm leach bliley act and state insurance laws and regulations the business of insurance is primarily regulated by the states and is also affected by a range of legislative developments at the state and federal levels 
the recent financial services modernization act of the so called gramm leach bliley act  or glba includes several privacy provisions and introduces new controls over the transfer and use of individuals nonpublic personal data by financial institutions  including insurance companies  insurance agents and brokers and certain other entities licensed by state insurance regulatory authorities 
additional federal legislation aimed at protecting the privacy of nonpublic personal financial and health information is proposed and over state privacy bills are pending 
glba provides that there is no federal preemption of a state s insurance related privacy laws if the state law is more stringent than the privacy rules imposed under glba 
accordingly  state insurance regulators or state legislatures will likely adopt rules that will limit the ability of insurance companies  insurance agents and brokers and certain other entities licensed by state insurance regulatory authorities to disclose and use non public information about consumers to third parties 
these limitations will require the disclosure by these entities of their privacy policies to consumers and  in some circumstances  will allow consumers to prevent the disclosure or use of certain personal information to an unaffiliated third party 
pursuant to the authority granted under glba to state insurance regulatory authorities to regulate the privacy of nonpublic personal information provided to consumers and customers of insurance companies  insurance agents and brokers and certain other entities licensed by state insurance regulatory authorities  the national association of insurance commissioners has recently promulgated a new model regulation called privacy of consumer financial and health information regulation 
some states issued this model regulation before july   while other states must pass certain legislative reforms to implement new state privacy rules pursuant to glba 
in addition  glba requires state insurance regulators to establish standards for administrative  technical and physical safeguards pertaining to customer records and information to a ensure their security and confidentiality  b protect against anticipated threats and hazards to their security and integrity  and c protect against unauthorized access to and use of these records and information 
however  no state insurance regulators have yet issued any final regulations in response to such security and confidentiality requirements 
the privacy and security provisions of glba will significantly affect how a consumer s nonpublic personal information is transmitted through and used by diversified financial services companies and conveyed to and used by outside vendors and other unaffiliated third parties 
due to the increasing popularity of the internet  laws and regulations may be passed dealing with issues such as user privacy  pricing  content and quality of products and services  and those regulations could adversely affect the growth of the online financial services industry 
if internet use does not grow as a result of privacy or security concerns  increasing regulation or for other reasons  the growth of uici s internet based business would be hindered 
it is not possible at this time to assess the impact of the privacy provisions on uici s financial condition or results of operations 
health insurance portability and accountability act of the federal health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa contains provisions requiring mandatory standardization of certain communications between health plans including health insurance companies  electronic clearinghouses and health care providers who transmit certain health information electronically 
hipaa requires health plans to use specific data content standards  mandates the use of specific identifiers eg  national provider identifiers and national employer identifiers and requires specific privacy and security procedures 
hipaa authorized the secretary of the federal department of health and human services hhs to issue standards for the privacy and security of medical records and other individually identifiable patient data 
in december  hhs issued final regulations regarding the privacy of individually identifiable health information 
this final rule on privacy applies to both electronic and paper records and imposes extensive requirements on the way in which health care providers  health plan sponsors  health insurance companies and their business associates use and disclose protected information 
under the new hipaa privacy rules  the company will now be required to a comply with a variety of requirements concerning its use and disclosure of individuals protected health information  b establish rigorous internal procedures to protect health information and c enter into business associate contracts with other companies that use similar privacy protection procedures 
the final rules do not provide for complete federal preemption of state laws  but  rather  preempt all contrary state laws unless the state law is more stringent 
these rules must be complied with by april  sanctions for failing to comply with standards issued pursuant to hipaa include criminal penalties of up to  per violation and civil sanctions of up to  per violation 
due to the complex and controversial nature of the privacy regulations  they may be subject to court challenge  as well as further legislative and regulatory actions that could alter their effect 
in august  hhs published for comment proposed rules related to the security of electronic health data  including individual health information and medical records  for health plans  health care providers  and health care clearinghouses that maintain or transmit health information electronically 
the proposed rules would require these businesses to establish and maintain responsible and appropriate safeguards to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of this information 
the standards embraced by these rules include the implementation of technical and organization policies  practices and procedures for security and confidentiality of health information and protecting its integrity  education and training programs  authentication of individuals who access this information  system controls  physical security and disaster recovery systems  protection of external communications and use of electronic signatures 
these proposed rules have not yet become final 
uici is currently reviewing the potential impact of the hipaa privacy regulations on its operations  including its information technology and security systems 
the company cannot at this time predict with specificity what impact a the recently adopted final hipaa rules governing the privacy of individually identifiable health information and b the proposed hipaa rules for ensuring the security of individually identifiable health information may have on the business or results of operations of the company 
however  these new rules will likely increase the company s burden of regulatory compliance with respect to our life and health insurance products and other information based products  and may reduce the amount of information the company may disclose and use if the company s customers do not consent to such disclosure and use 
the company does not currently believe that the restrictions and duties imposed by the recently adopted final rules on the privacy of individually identifiable health information  or the proposed rule on security of individually identifiable health information  will have a material adverse effect on uici s business and future results of operations 
income taxes the company s effective tax rate from continuing operations was for compared to for and for the effective tax rate varied from the federal tax rate of  primarily due to the release of the remaining valuation allowance on the operating loss carryover of ams 
the effective tax rate varied from the federal tax rate of  primarily due to the decrease in the valuation allowance related to the partial utilization by ams of its operating loss carryover and a release of a reserve for taxes on undistributed earnings from its subsidiaries that were previously less than owned and are now wholly owned 
the effective tax rate varied from the federal tax rate of  primarily due to the significant operating loss at ams  for which the company was not able to recognize a tax benefit 
ams entered the company s consolidated group for tax purposes on august  prior to that date ams filed a separate tax return 
as of december   the company has recognized a net deferred tax asset of million 
realization of the net deferred tax asset is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income 
although realization is not assured  management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax asset will be realized based on anticipated profits and available tax planning strategies

other matters the state of domicile of each of the company s domestic insurance subsidiaries imposes minimum risk based capital requirements that were developed by the naic 
the formulas for determining the amount of risk based capital specify various weighting factors that are applied to financial balances and premium levels based on the perceived degree of risk 
regulatory compliance is determined by a ratio of a company s regulatory total adjusted capital  as defined  to its authorized control level risk based capital  as defined 
companies specific trigger points or ratios are classified within certain levels  each of which requires specified corrective action 
at december   the risk based capital ratio of each of the company s domestic insurance subsidiaries significantly exceeded the ratios for which regulatory corrective action would be required 
dividends paid by domestic insurance companies out of earned surplus in any year are limited by the law of the state of domicile

inflation inflation historically has had a significant impact on the health insurance business 
in recent years  inflation in the costs of medical care covered by such insurance has exceeded the general rate of inflation 
under basic hospital medical insurance coverage  established ceilings for covered expenses limit the impact of inflation on the amount of claims paid 
under catastrophic hospital expense plans and preferred provider contracts  covered expenses are generally limited only by a maximum lifetime benefit and a maximum lifetime benefit per accident or sickness 
thus  inflation may have a significantly greater impact on the amount of claims paid under catastrophic hospital expense and preferred provider plans as compared to claims under basic hospital medical coverage 
as a result  trends in health care costs must be monitored and rates adjusted accordingly 
under the health insurance policies issued in the self employed market  the primary insurer generally has the right to increase rates upon days written notice and subject to regulatory approval in some cases 
the annuity and universal life type policies issued directly and assumed by the company are significantly impacted by inflation 
interest rates affect the amount of interest that existing policyholders expect to have credited to their policies 
however  the company believes that the annuity and universal life type policies are generally competitive with those offered by other insurance companies of similar size  and the investment portfolio is managed to minimize the effects of inflation

safe harbor statement under the private securities litigation reform act of certain statements set forth herein or incorporated by reference herein from the company s filings that are not historical facts are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act 
actual results may differ materially from those included in the forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties including  but not limited to  the following changes in general economic conditions  including the performance of financial markets  and interest rates  competitive  regulatory or tax changes that affect the cost of or demand for the company s products  health care reform  the ability to predict and effectively manage claims related to health care costs  and reliance on key management and adequacy of claim liabilities 
the company s future results will depend in large part on accurately predicting health care costs incurred on existing business and upon the company s ability to control future health care costs through product and benefit design  underwriting criteria  utilization management and negotiation of favorable provider contracts 
changes in mandated benefits  utilization rates  demographic characteristics  health care practices  provider consolidation  inflation  new pharmaceuticals technologies  clusters of high cost cases  the regulatory environment and numerous other factors are beyond the control of any health plan provider and may adversely affect the company s ability to predict and control health care costs and claims  as well as the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
periodic renegotiations of hospital and other provider contracts coupled with continued consolidation of physician  hospital and other provider groups may result in increased health care costs and limit the company s ability to negotiate favorable rates 
in addition  the company faces competitive and regulatory pressure to contain premium prices 
fiscal concerns regarding the continued viability of government sponsored programs such as medicare and medicaid may cause decreasing reimbursement rates for these programs 
any limitation on the company s ability to increase or maintain its premium levels  design products  implement underwriting criteria or negotiate competitive provider contracts may adversely affect the company s financial condition or results of operations 
the company s insurance subsidiaries are subject to extensive regulation in their states of domicile and the other states in which they do business under statutes that typically delegate broad regulatory  supervisory and administrative powers to state insurance departments and agencies 
state insurance departments have also periodically conducted and continue to conduct financial and market conduct examinations and other inquiries of uici s insurance subsidiaries 
state insurance regulatory agencies have authority to levy monetary fines and penalties resulting from findings made during the course of such examinations and inquiries 
historically  the company s insurance subsidiaries have from time to time been subject to such regulatory fines and penalties 
while none of such fines or penalties individually or in the aggregate have to date had a material adverse effect on the results of operations or financial condition of the company  the company could be adversely affected by increases in regulatory fines or penalties an or changes in the scope  nature and or intensity of regulatory scrutiny and review 
the company provides health insurance products to consumers in the self employed market in states 
a substantial portion of such products is issued to members of various independent membership associations that endorse the products and act as the master policyholder for such products 
the two principal membership associations in the self employed market for which the company underwrites insurance are the national association for the self employed nase and the alliance for affordable services aas 
the associations provide their membership with a number of endorsed benefits and products  including health insurance underwritten by the company 
subject to applicable state law  individuals generally may not obtain insurance under an association s master policy unless they are also members of the associations 
uga agents and cornerstone agents also act as enrollers of new members for the associations  for which the agents receive compensation 
specialized association services  inc a company controlled by the adult children of ronald l 
jensen 
the chairman of the company provides administrative and benefit procurement services to the associations  and a subsidiary of the company sells new membership sales leads to the enrollers and video and print services to the associations and to specialized association services  inc see note n of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in addition to health insurance premiums derived from the sale of health insurance  the company receives fee income from the associations  including fees associated with the enrollment of new members  fees for association membership marketing and administrative services and fees for certain association member benefits 
the agreements with these associations requiring the associations to continue as the master policyholder and to endorse the company s insurance products to their respective members are terminable by the company and the associations upon not less than one year s advance notice to the other party 
recent articles in the popular press have been critical of association group coverage 
in december  the national association of insurance commissioners naic convened a special task force to review association group coverage  and the company is aware that selected states are reviewing the laws and regulations under which association group policies are issued 
the company has also recently been named a party to three lawsuits challenging the nature of the relationship between mega and the national association for the self employed nase  the membership association that has endorsed mega s health insurance products 
see note o of notes to consolidated financial statements 
while the company believes it is providing association group coverage in full compliance with applicable law  changes in the relationship between the company and the membership associations and or changes in the laws and regulations governing so called association group insurance particularly changes that would subject the issuance of policies to prior premium rate approval and or require the issuance of policies on a guaranteed issue basis could have a material adverse impact on the financial condition  results of operations and or business of the company 
the company s academic management services corp 
business could be adversely affected by changes in the federal higher education act of  which authorizes and governs most federal student aid and student loan programs  and or changes in other relevant federal or state laws  rules and regulations 
the higher education act is subject to review and reauthorization by the recently convened th congress 
congress last reauthorized the higher education act in while the company believes that the higher education act of will in fact be reauthorized  there can be no assurance of the form that reauthorization will take or the changes that the reauthorization bill will bring to the law and regulations governing student finance 
in addition  existing legislation and future measures by the federal government may adversely affect the amount and nature of federal financial assistance available with respect to loans made through the us department of education 
finally  the level of competition currently in existence in the secondary market for loans made under the federal loan programs could be reduced  resulting in fewer potential buyers of the federal loans and lower prices available in the secondary market for those loans 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and other relevant market rate or price changes 
market risk is directly influenced by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying assets are traded 
the primary market risk to the company s investment portfolio is interest rate risk associated with investments and the amount of interest that policyholders expect to have credited to their policies 
the interest rate risk taken in the investment portfolio is managed relative to the duration of the liabilities 
the company s investment portfolio consists mainly of high quality  liquid securities that provide current investment returns 
the company believes that the annuity and universal life type policies are generally competitive with those offered by other insurance companies of similar size 
the company does not anticipate significant changes in the primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed in the future reporting periods based upon what is known or expected to be in effect in future reporting periods 
profitability of the student loans is affected by the spreads between the interest yield on the student loans and the cost of the funds borrowed under the various credit facilities 
although the interest rates on the student loans and the interest rate on the credit facilities are variable  the gross interest earned by lenders on stafford student loans uses the results of day t bill auctions as the base rate  while the base rate on the credit facilities is libor 
the effect of rising interest rates on earnings on stafford loans is generally small  as both revenues and costs adjust to new market levels 
in addition to stafford loans  the company holds plus loans on which the interest rate yield is set annually beginning july through june by regulation at a fixed rate 
the company had approximately million principal amount of plus loans outstanding at december  the fixed yield on plus loans was for the twelve months ended june  and was reset to for the twelve months beginning july  these loans are financed with borrowings whose rates are subject to reset  generally monthly 
during the twelve months beginning july   the cost of borrowings to finance this portion of the student loan portfolio could rise or fall  while the rate earned on the student loans will remain fixed 
sensitivity analysis is defined as the measurement of potential loss in future earnings  fair values or cash flows of market sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates and other market rates or prices over a selected time 
in the company s sensitivity analysis model  a hypothetical change in market rates is selected that is expected to reflect reasonably possible near term changes in those rates 
near term is defined as a period of time going forward up to one year from the date of the consolidated financial statements 
in this sensitivity analysis model  the company uses fair values to measure its potential loss 
the primary market risk to the company s market sensitive instruments is interest rate risk 
the sensitivity analysis model uses a basis point change in interest rates to measure the hypothetical change in fair value of financial instruments included in the model 
for invested assets  duration modeling is used to calculate changes in fair values 
duration on invested assets is adjusted to call  put and interest rate reset features 
the sensitivity analysis model produces a loss in fair value of market sensitive instruments of million based on a basis point increase in interest rates as of december  this loss value only reflects the impact of an interest rate increase on the fair value of the company s financial instruments 
the company has not used derivative financial instruments in managing its market risk
