part i item business 
we incorporated in delaware on april   and commenced operations in july we are a biopharmaceutical company focused principally on discovering and developing drugs that target g protein coupled receptors  called gpcrs 
gpcrs are an important part of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries drug discovery and development efforts  and are well established targets for therapeutics 
according to an august survey published in the scientific journal  nature reviews  drug discovery  about of all drugs on the market act through one or more gpcrs 
based on revenues  of the leading pharmaceutical products act wholly or in part act on gpcrs 
in  these gpcr based pharmaceutical products represented over billion in sales  and included claritin for allergies  zantac for gastric ulcers  imitrex for migraines and cozaar for hypertension 
our proprietary technologies include our constitutively activated receptor technology cart and melanophore technology  which we believe allow us to discover drug like compounds more efficiently and effectively than other assay methods 
we use cart to discover drug like compounds by genetically altering receptors to mimic the biological response that occurs when the native ligand binds to the receptor 
these cart activated receptors are used to screen chemical libraries to identify chemical compounds that alter the biological response of the receptor  and  thereby  represent lead compounds for drug candidates 
our melanophore technology is a simple  robust and widely applicable functional assay technique for the identification of modulators of both cart activated and so called wild type  or non altered  gpcrs 
using these and other technologies  as well as our expertise in the gpcr field  we have discovered drug like compounds that have demonstrated pharmacological activity in pre clinical studies indicative of potential therapeutic value 
our efforts are focused in four main therapeutic areas metabolic diseases  cardiovascular diseases  central nervous system disorders and inflammatory diseases 
we are pursuing numerous gpcr targets in each of these therapeutic areas  prioritizing the most promising targets for more intensive research and development efforts 
we also have research and development collaborations with pharmaceutical companies worldwide  generating significant revenues for us 
in  we recorded revenues from collaborations exceeding million  and we began new collaborations with merck co  inc merck and ferring pharmaceuticals  inc  a unit of privately held ferring holding sa ferring 
g protein coupled receptors gpcrs are a class of receptors that mediate the majority of cell to cell communication within humans 
the broad variety of ligands  including hormones  neurotransmitters  ions and amino acids  which signal via gpcrs  underscores the physiological importance of this receptor class 
the ability of small molecules to modulate the activity of gpcrs with a high degree of selectivity and sensitivity  combined with the anatomically selective nature of gpcr gene expression  is why this receptor class is pharmaceutically important 
a large percentage of today s prescription drugs target one or more gpcrs  with most major therapeutic areas served to some extent by a number of gpcr based drugs 
clearly  no single class of genes ranks higher than gpcrs in terms of drug discovery potential 
based on the percentage of gpcrs found in other organisms  the number of gpcrs within the human genome has been estimated to be as great as to  sequencing of the human genome and analysis of predicted gpcr gene structure has publicly identified approximately gpcrs 
approximately of these are categorized as known gpcrs because their native ligands have been identified 
the superfamily of gpcrs is subdivided into three major gpcr sub families based on the pharmacological nature of their ligands and sequence similarity 
this includes the class i  or rhodopsin like  gpcrs  the class ii  or secretin like  gpcrs  and the class iii  or metabotropic glutamate like  gpcrs  which represent about  and of the known gpcrs  respectively 
today s clinically successful gpcr based drugs have targeted about of the approximately known gpcrs  predominantly in the biogenic amine family  a sub family of class i gpcrs 
however  molecular cloning efforts in combination with the sequencing of the human genome have afforded the opportunity to identify both additional receptor subtypes of known gpcrs and entirely novel gpcrs 
these novel gpcrs are categorized as orphan gpcrs because their native ligands remain to be identified 
orphan gpcrs offer great promise for the development of novel gpcr based therapeutics and are a major focus of our research 
gpcr technologies cart traditional ligand based drug screening methods require the identification and use of the receptor s native ligand for drug discovery 
in contrast  cart does not require the use of the native ligand 
instead  cart allows us to discover drug like compounds by cart activating receptors to mimic the biological response that occurs when the native ligand binds to the receptor 
therefore  cart avoids a major bottleneck in drug discovery efforts at orphan receptors by eliminating the step of first identifying the native ligand 
cart also facilitates drug discovery at known receptors  as discussed below 
cart can be applied broadly to gpcrs because all gpcrs have highly similar structural elements  consisting of three extracellular loops  three intracellular loops  and seven regions that cross through the cell membrane and connect the extracellular and intracellular loops 
under normal physiological conditions  a gpcr exists in equilibrium between an inactive state and an active state 
when a gpcr s equilibrium shifts to an active state  the gpcr is able to act through or couple to a g protein  thereby eliciting a biological response 
when a gpcr s equilibrium shifts to an inactive state  the receptor is typically unable to couple to a g protein and is  therefore  unable to elicit a biological response 
when a native ligand binds to the gpcr  the gpcr s equilibrium shifts and the gpcr is stabilized in the active state 
by altering the genetic structure of a gpcr  cart stabilizes the gpcr in the active state in the absence of the native ligand 
drug screening and discovery targeting gpcrs using cart is comprised of four stages altering the molecular structure of an intracellular segment of the gpcr  for example the third intracellular loop  to generate a cart activated form of the gpcr  introducing the cart activated form of the receptor into cells  which in turn express the cart activated form of these gpcrs at the cell surface  analyzing the cells expressing the cart activated gpcr to detect biological responses that result from the coupling of the cart activated gpcr to a g protein  and screening chemical libraries of small molecule compounds against the cart activated gpcr to identify compounds that interact with the gpcr 
screening using cart allows us to simultaneously identify drug leads that act as receptor activators or agonists  which increase the detected biological response  or act as receptor inhibitors  which decrease the detected response 
inverse agonists  which are inhibitors of ligand independent receptor activation  are the preferred drugs for treating diseases in which ligand independent receptor activity may be important  such as schizophrenia 
we believe the inverse agonists that we identify may possess improved pharmacological properties over neutral antagonists because inverse agonists inhibit both ligand dependent as well as ligand independent activity  whereas neutral antagonists inhibit only ligand dependent activity 
in addition  because cart does not require use of the native ligand  we are not restricted to identifying compounds that bind to a gpcr at the binding site for the native ligand 
instead  cart exposes the entire gpcr surface to potential drug leads  allowing for the detection of drug leads that may bind anywhere on the receptor surface 
we believe that this feature of cart is important not only with respect to orphan gpcrs  but to known receptors as well  because this feature of cart provides us with the ability to discover new drugs with novel mechanisms of action 
in summary  we believe that cart offers several key advantages for drug discovery over other screening techniques 
screening cart activated gpcrs does not require prior identification of the native ligand for an orphan receptor  enhances the detection of  and allows us to simultaneously identify  both receptor inhibitor and receptor activator drug leads  allows for the identification of drug leads that inhibit both ligand dependent and ligand independent activity  and provides the ability to discover novel and improved therapeutics directed at known receptors 
gpcr technologies melanophore we believe that our patented melanophore technology is the most broadly applicable gpcr high throughput screen 
gpcrs couple to g proteins of various classes  including the gs  gq  or gi o classes 
melanophore technology can detect gpcrs that couple to all major g protein classes 
our melanophore technology is  therefore  ideal for studies of orphan receptors whose coupling parameters remain unknown 
for most types of lower animals  melanophores are the primary chromatophores responsible for skin color control 
each melanophore cell has numerous cytoplasmic organelles called melanosomes 
melanosomes contain the dark pigment melanin 
pigment distribution determines whether a cell is light or dark 
when melanosomes are clustered or aggregated at a single central intracellular location  the melanophore is light in color 
when the melanosomes are dispersed evenly throughout the melanophore  the melanophore is dark in color 
light color results from the activation of gi or go classes  while dark color results from the activation of gs or gq classes 
receptor activity can be easily determined with both video imaging and standard microplate readers 
melanophore technology provides a robust means for identifying gpcr agonists  antagonists and inverse agonists 
unlike other gpcr assays such as those involving fluorescence  luminescence  visual dyes or reporter genes  the color change in melanophores is fully and rapidly reversible  enabling direct reading of inverse agonist activity at gpcrs 
project genesis we believe there is significant value in possessing the most complete information set on gpcrs  especially where and how they work in the body and how they interact with the small molecule chemicals that modulate their activity 
project genesis is a program directed at screening a broad range of gpcrs against a diverse set of small molecule chemicals 
the main components of project genesis are as follows identifying human gpcrs our scientists have identified over human gpcrs 
many of these were identified using traditional homology search methods such as basic local alignment search tool  or blast  analysis of the public and private genomic databases 
our scientists have gone further than traditional homology search methods  designing and using over proprietary statistical search algorithms  called hidden markov models or hmms 
in addition to identifying novel gpcr sequences within the genome  we are actively engaged in obtaining corresponding full length cdna clones for the purpose of high throughput screening 
expression and localization of gpcrs the tissues or body systems in which a gpcr is located and the extent or level of its expression gives important hints as to its therapeutic relevance 
for example  knowing the extent of over or under expression of a gpcr in normal and diseased states yields important information on the therapeutic relevance of a particular gpcr target 
such information is important as we prioritize the hundreds of gpcrs we have identified 
our scientists are continuing to study gpcrs in increasing numbers and diversity of normal and diseased tissues 
our scientific work has contributed to the understanding that large numbers of gpcrs previously thought to be involved only in olfaction taste and smell may very well have other significant functions based on their expression levels in certain non olfactory tissues 
high throughput screening over the next few years  we intend to use our proprietary cart and melanophore technologies to screen hundreds of human gpcrs against our chemical library of approximately  compounds 
optimizing leads into potential drug candidates through chemistry we have built a significant medicinal chemistry group that includes over chemists 
these chemists will be responsible for the task of taking the initial hits from the screening of receptors against our chemical library and optimizing these hits for drug candidate selection 
we expect to develop a significant intellectual property portfolio around the chemical scaffolds that have potential therapeutic value for gpcr targets 
research and development programs and collaborations our goal is to discover and develop novel  proprietary drugs that target gpcrs through focused internal efforts and alliances with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies worldwide 
research and development programs through the use of our gpcr technologies  we have successfully identified compounds that inhibit or activate a number of known and orphan receptor targets 
we focus on discovering and developing drugs to targets in the following therapeutic areas metabolic diabetes  obesity diabetes it is well established that gpcr signaling provides critical contributions to the control of both insulin secretion and insulin action  disruptions of which are key components of type ii diabetes 
we are focusing our discovery efforts on approximately known and orphan gpcr targets that we believe are involved in beta cell function and insulin regulation  using both in vitro and in vivo approaches 
for example  we have discovered orphan gpcrs that are selectively expressed within pancreatic beta cells that represent potential targets for regulating insulin secretion 
examination of the constitutively active form of one such receptor  which we call islet receptor  in in vitro systems confirms that the receptor couples to the appropriate cellular signaling molecule adenylate cyclase and cyclic amp camp to regulate insulin release 
in addition  we have developed orally active small molecules that activate islet receptor that stimulate glucose regulated insulin secretion in vivo 
these data provide information supporting the development of islet receptor agonists as a means to regulate insulin release 
we believe our small molecule agonists of islet receptor may offer significant advantages over current peptide approaches to treating diabetes because the oral activity of these small molecules circumvents the need for intravenous injection required for insulin and other insulin protein or peptide secretagogues 
obesity we have identified novel gpcrs that we believe regulate energy homeostasis 
drug discovery efforts are currently underway to identify novel drug candidates targeting gpcrs in the central nervous system cns and peripheral tissues that may act to reduce fat mass in human patients 
we have focused both on known and orphan gpcrs expressed in the hypothalamus  which is an area of the brain known to be critical for regulating metabolism and food intake 
for example  we have selected several orally active small molecule activators of the htc receptor for further development 
furthermore  our scientists have identified orally active small molecules that inhibit key neuropeptide systems in the hypothalamus and that have been shown to be efficacious in animal models of feeding 
cardiovascular atherosclerosis  heart disease we have built internal research programs in two focused cardiovascular therapeutic areas  atherosclerosis and heart failure 
we believe our expertise in gpcrs provides a significant competitive advantage in the development of novel drugs for these important therapeutic areas 
the decision to focus on these two areas is based on significant unmet medical need  growing target populations and a mechanistic understanding of the role of gpcrs in the disease processes 
for example  acute myocardial infarction followed by heart failure is a direct consequence of atherosclerosis and remains the major cause of cardiovascular death 
we have identified certain gpcrs that we believe play a major role in these processes and are identifying small molecules directed at these gpcr targets that could provide cardioprotection following myocardial infarction and therapeutic benefit during heart failure 
even though there are very successful drugs available for lowering ldl cholesterol  treatment of individuals with low hdl cholesterol still remains a major focus of research in the area of atherosclerosis 
we have identified novel gpcrs that regulate plasma lipid profiles  including hdl cholesterol 
small molecules directed at these gpcrs are currently being evaluated in preclinical animal models  and results obtained thus far are encouraging 
central nervous system sleep disorders  schizophrenia  depression and anxiety  neurodegeneration sleep disorders we are currently in early preclinical testing of novel compounds targeting known gpcrs in the cns that may be beneficial for the treatment of certain sleep disorders 
drugs with similar receptor binding activity  but with less selectivity for the intended receptor target s  have been tested by others in the clinic and have demonstrated significant increases in slow wave sleep  reduced number of awakenings and decreased latency to sleep onset without sedative or hang over effects associated with other sleep agents 
we believe that our compounds are more selective and  as such  may be associated with fewer side effects while maintaining efficacy 
schizophrenia all existing pharmacotherapies for the treatment of schizophrenia target gpcrs in the dopamine and serotonin systems 
we believe that there is a significant need in the marketplace for better  safer and more efficacious antipsychotics 
we are currently developing a novel series of highly selective compounds that have activity at known gpcrs of interest  in particular the serotonin subtype receptor known as hta 
these compounds are currently undergoing preclinical evaluation and have demonstrated oral activity in preclinical models of schizophrenia 
in addition  we are implementing drug discovery programs to identify novel orphan gpcrs that may also play a role in the treatment of schizophrenia 
depression and anxiety we have several ongoing programs focused on identifying novel small molecule modulators targeting receptors that we believe may play an important role in depression and anxiety 
the majority of available treatments for depressive disorders target the serotonin and or norepinephrine transporter site 
the clinical efficacy of these therapeutics is typically delayed by days to weeks after treatment onset 
this delay suggests that the target mediating therapeutic effect may be downstream from these transporter sites and has led to a search for factors that may explain the therapeutic lag time of these compounds 
recently  specific intracellular signaling events have been identified which appear to be regulated by chronic administration of antidepressant drugs 
we believe that one such factor is the camp response element binding protein creb  which plays a critical role in mediating neuronal plasticity 
postmortem studies and preclinical work assessing experimentally induced increases or decreases in creb function have both provided evidence for a role of this factor in depressive symptomatology 
we are actively assessing the potential of gpcrs whose activity may be associated with and alter creb function in particular brain areas 
we have prioritized a gpcr target for which antagonists are efficacious in preclinical tests of antidepressant activity and are in the process of evaluating novel small molecules that modulate this gpcr s activity 
neurodegeneration the goal of our effort in neurodegeneration is to discover novel gpcrs contributing to neurodegenerative diseases and to provide preliminary preclinical data for the validation of chemical compounds to the designated targets 
we are currently focusing on diabetic peripheral neuropathy dpn and parkinson s disease 
dpn is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects the sensory  motor and or autonomic nerves and results in the abnormal function of these nerves 
dpn is particularly widespread  affecting of the million americans with diabetes  and can lead to the most common functional abnormality associated with neuropathy  which is known as diabetic foot  and potential ulcer formation  infection and even amputation 
in this disease the protective sheath  called myelin  that protects the nerve degenerates  which results in nerve exposure and subsequent nerve damage 
our approach to dpn is to target receptors that we believe are involved in maintaining the integrity of schwann cells  which are responsible for producing myelin 
we have identified several orphan gpcrs in schwann cells that may be involved in several aspects of neuroprotection and or nerve regeneration 
the level of expression of one gpcr has been shown to be regulated in the pathogenesis of dpn 
we are currently evaluating the role of this receptor and other targets for therapeutic intervention to treat peripheral neuropathy using orally active small molecules 
over three million people in the world suffer from parkinson s disease  a chronic progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopamine producing neurons in an area of the brain called the substantia nigra 
the loss of dopamine producing neurons results in characteristic clinical features  such as bradykinesia  resting tremor and postural reflex impairments 
dopamine replacement therapy ie levodopa  or l dopa remains the most potent pharmacological treatment available for treating this disorder 
unfortunately  dopamine replacement therapy can lead to serious motor complications that limit its long term use 
using our cart technology and molecular biology approaches  we have identified a novel orphan receptor that is expressed and co localized with the dopamine receptor d  known to be the receptor responsible for mediating the effects of dopamine in locomotor centers of the brain 
we have identified the intracellular second messenger that this receptor activates and believe that inverse agonists to this receptor may have the ability to amplify dopamine function  which is underactive in parkinson s disease 
inflammation inflammatory bowel disease  asthma we are developing small molecule therapeutics that target gpcrs involved in the inflammatory process 
diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease such as crohn s disease and ulcerative colitis and asthma are initiated and exacerbated by an aberrant inflammatory response 
immune cells such as eosinophils  neutrophils  mast cells and specific t cell subsets are effectors in these diseases 
we have identified gpcrs that are restricted in cell type expression and that function to mediate the inflammatory process 
we have discovered and are evaluating small molecule modulators of these receptors in animal models of efficacy in inflammatory diseases 
some of these small molecules are targeted at blocking the inflammatory process and others are targeted at initiating an anti inflammatory process 
in the case of asthma  there is good evidence that gpcrs located on effector cells and in airway smooth muscle are involved in the complex inflammatory processes that result in the disease 
our current efforts are focused on developing novel drug candidates targeting these gpcrs to treat and potentially prevent asthma 
we have made significant discoveries in the areas of inflammatory bowel disease and asthma  identifying several gpcrs that are selectively expressed and amenable to high throughput screening and drug discovery 
our collaborators we have entered into strategic collaborations to discover and develop novel drug leads using our gpcr technologies and expect to enter into new collaborations in the future 
our major collaborators in were as follows eli lilly and company in april  we entered into a research collaboration with eli lilly and company eli lilly focused on the cns 
we have contributed enabled gpcr targets to eli lilly 
our research activities under this collaboration are scheduled to be completed on april  however  we will continue to be eligible to receive milestones and royalties if small molecule drug candidates and drugs are developed as a result of this collaboration 
merck co  inc in october  we entered into a research and license agreement with merck  one of the world s leading pharmaceutical companies  to collaborate on validating and developing therapeutics at three gpcrs 
under the collaboration  we received an upfront payment of million 
we also received  and will continue to receive  research funding from merck for our internal resources committed under this agreement 
this agreement provides for additional preclinical  clinical and marketing milestone payments and royalties on sales of products discovered from this collaboration  if any 
ferring pharmaceuticals  inc in may  we entered into a research and license agreement with ferring  a biopharmaceutical company with operations in countries and products distributed in more than countries 
the collaboration focuses on a validated gpcr target in the field of reproductive biology  a field in which ferring has a significant development and marketing presence 
using our technologies  we have synthesized and screened focused compound libraries based on structures contributed by ferring and us 
this agreement provides for research and development funding  milestone payments and royalties on sales of products discovered from this collaboration  if any  from ferring 
taigen biotechnology co  ltd 
in july  we entered into a license agreement with taigen biotechnology co  ltd  a start up biopharmaceutical organization taigen focused on the discovery and development of innovative therapeutics 
in exchange for a license to our technologies  including the right to select and obtain several gpcrs from us  we received equity in taigen s series a preferred financing  but did not receive any cash payment 
we may receive additional equity in taigen in exchange for rights to select additional gpcrs from us 
we will activate  develop a screening assay for and transfer selected activated receptors to taigen 
we may also receive royalty payments based on taigen licensing revenues and drug sales  if any 
taisho pharmaceutical co  ltd 
in january  we signed an amendment to our initial agreement with taisho  a japanese pharmaceutical company taisho 
under the amended agreement  we will collaborate with taisho to identify and develop small molecule gpcr ligands for the treatment of obesity and or certain cns related disorders 
we will also share costs and marketing rights with taisho  and each party will pay the other royalties on drug sales  if any 
in addition  in october  we signed an amendment with taisho 
under the amended agreement  taisho returned worldwide rights to the f program to us in exchange for royalties on drug sales  if any 
other collaborators in addition to revenues received from the above major collaborators  we recognized an aggregate of approximately  in  from glaxosmithkline  tularik  astrazeneca and eisai for licensing access to certain of our screening technologies 
please see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a more detailed discussion of our major collaborations  including financial information  activities being conducted and termination provisions 
database we have developed a web based database that can be used to access relevant information and data generated from our research and development programs 
we believe that our database is unique in that it allows individual users to obtain information on specific gpcr targets  including gene sequence information  chemical structures  data developed by us from gpcr tissues and cellular distribution studies  the results of drug screening and the results of our animal studies 
in developing this database  we focused on the magnitude of data that we would generate based upon the number of gpcrs available to us  and the number of chemical compounds that would be screened in our assays 
our database has a number of proprietary features that allow us to efficiently organize  store and access these data and information 
using this database  our collaborators and our scientists can search for compounds by structure and assay results and can search for genes by sequence and tissue or disease expression 
several of our collaborators are currently using our database in an interactive mode  and we believe the depth and breadth of data accumulated there can form the basis of future collaborations 
intellectual property our success depends in large part on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and information  and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties 
we rely on a combination of patent  trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  as well as confidentiality agreements  licensing agreements and other agreements  to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
as of march   we own or have exclusively licensed the following issued patents in the united states  in european countries  three in australia  two in new zealand  and one in each of japan  north korea and south africa 
in addition  as of march   we have more than pending patent applications before the united states patent and trademark office  foreign patent offices and international patent authorities 
these issued and pending patents are directed to cart  melanophore technology  chemical compositions of matter  methods of treatment utilizing chemical compositions  or gpcr genes 
there is no assurance that any of these pending patents will issue  or that any of the issued patents will be enforceable or cover a drug product or other commercially significant product or method 
except for the united states patents relating to our melanophore technology  the term of all of our current patents and future patents  if any  will commence on the date of issuance and terminate years from the earliest effective filing date of the patent application 
since our united states melanophore patents were issued under now superceded rules that provided a patent term of years from the date of issuance  the term of these patents are scheduled to end in  more than years after their earliest filing date 
because the time from filing to issuance of biotechnology patent applications is often more than three years  the resulting term of our pending patents  if any  on our products and technologies may be substantially less than years 
in the united states  patent term extensions are available for certain delays in patent office proceedings and united states food and drug administration fda approval 
however  due to the specific requirements for obtaining these extensions  there is no assurance that our patents will be afforded extensions even if we encounter significant delays in patent office proceedings or fda approval 
we seek patent protection for our key inventions  including cart  new receptors that we discover  genetically altered receptors  and drug leads we identify 
it has been possible to obtain broad  composition of matter patents on novel chemical compounds  such as the drug leads 
it has also been possible to obtain broad method patents for techniques and procedures for screening and drug identification technologies 
it has generally been more difficult to obtain broad composition of matter patents for nucleic acid and amino acid sequences 
however  it has been possible to obtain patents that protect specific sequences and functional equivalents of those sequences 
furthermore  intellectual property law allows for separate and distinct patents for novel  altered genetic sequences that have improved properties over previously disclosed sequences 
we believe that we can obtain patents on certain of our cart activated receptor sequences because they are not functional equivalents of the natural version of the receptor 
we expect to continue to develop other means of activating gpcrs for drug screening and to file patent applications and explore in licensing opportunities on any novel technology we develop 
as a general matter  obtaining patents in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical fields is highly uncertain and involves complex legal  scientific and factual matters 
obtaining a patent in the united states in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical fields is expensive and can  and often does  require several years to complete 
failure to receive patents pursuant to the applications referred to herein and any future applications could be harmful to us 
our patent filings in the united states may be subject to interference or reexamination proceedings 
the defense and prosecution of interference and reexamination proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings in the united states involve complex legal and factual questions 
we also file patent applications outside of the united states 
the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
third parties may attempt to oppose the issuance of our patents in foreign countries by way of opposition proceedings 
additionally  if an opposition proceeding is initiated against any of our patent filings in a foreign country  that proceeding could have an adverse effect on the corresponding patents that are issued or pending in the united states 
if we become involved in any interference  reexamination  opposition or litigation proceedings in the united states or foreign countries regarding patent or other proprietary rights  those proceedings may result in substantial cost to us  regardless of the outcome  and may have a material adverse affect on our ability to develop  manufacture  market or license our technologies or products  or to maintain or form strategic alliances 
we have recently been notified that the japanese patent office issued a notification of reasons for revocation of our japanese patent on our melanophore technology 
this is a proceeding to seek to invalidate our issued japanese patent 
we are investigating the facts relating to this notification and will oppose any revocation 
although we plan to aggressively prosecute our patent applications and defend our patents against third party infringement  we cannot assure you that any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or that  if issued  such patents will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
moreover  we cannot assure you that our patents  to the extent they are or will be issued  will provide us protection against competitors with other technologies 
our technologies and potential products may conflict with patents that have been or may be granted to competitors  universities or others 
as the biotechnology industry expands and more patents are issued  the risk increases that our technologies and potential products may give rise to claims that they infringe the patents of others 
third parties claiming infringement of their proprietary rights could bring legal actions against us claiming damages and seeking to enjoin our use or commercialization of a product or our use of a technology 
in particular  patent applications or patents for innovative and broadly applicable technologies  such as cart  are sometimes challenged by third parties  and held invalid by the courts 
we cannot assure you that such claims will not be brought against us in the future 
if any actions based on these claims are successful  in addition to any potential liability for damages  we could be required to obtain a license in order to continue to use a technology or to manufacture or market a product  or could be required to cease using those products or technologies 
any claim  with or without merit  could result in costly litigation and divert the efforts and attention of our scientific and management personnel 
we cannot assure you that we would prevail in any such action or that any license required under any patent would be made available or would be made available on acceptable terms 
in addition to patent protection  we rely on trade secrets  proprietary know how and continuing technological advances to develop and maintain our competitive position 
to maintain the confidentiality of our trade secrets and proprietary information  all of our employees are required to enter into and adhere to an employee confidentiality and invention assignment agreement  laboratory notebook policy  and invention disclosure protocol  as a condition of employment 
additionally  our employee confidentiality and invention assignment agreement requires that our employees not bring to arena  or use without proper authorization  any third party proprietary technology 
we also require our consultants and collaborators that have access to proprietary property to execute confidentiality and invention rights agreements in our favor before beginning their relationship with us 
while such arrangements are intended to enable us to better control the use and disclosure of our proprietary property and provide for our ownership of proprietary technology developed on our behalf  they may not provide us with meaningful protection for such property and technology in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure 
competition the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry is subject to rapid and significant change  and we may not be able to compete successfully with newly emerging technologies 
several of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater product development capabilities and financial  scientific and marketing resources than we do 
as a result  they may be able to adapt more readily to technological advances than we can  or to devote greater resources than we can to the research  development  marketing and promotion of drug discovery techniques or therapeutic products 
additionally  the technologies being developed by these companies may be more readily accepted or widely used than our technologies 
our future success will depend in large part on our ability to maintain our competitive position 
we devote significant resources to maintaining our scientific expertise and have established key relationships with academic centers performing research on gpcrs 
the focus of our scientific and business strategy is gpcrs 
most major pharmaceutical companies  as well as several biotechnology companies  have drug discovery programs based on gpcrs  including orphan gpcrs 
in addition  other companies have attempted to overcome the problems associated with traditional drug screening by embarking on a variety of alternative strategies 
however  we believe that our research efforts on gpcrs are competitive with the most active companies in the field  as evidenced by the number of targets cloned  expressed and screened 
further  we believe that our success in obtaining collaborations with major pharmaceutical companies validates the competitive advantages of our technologies 
we may rely on our collaborators for support of development programs and for the manufacturing and marketing of products 
our collaborators may be conducting multiple product development efforts within the same disease areas that are the subjects of their agreements with us  which may negatively impact the development of drugs that they discover which are subject to our agreements 
generally  our agreements with our collaborators also do not preclude them from pursuing development efforts in one or more therapeutic areas of interest in which we have internal development efforts ongoing 
government regulation our and our collaborator s on going drug development activities are subject to the laws and regulations of governmental authorities in the united states and other countries in which these products may be marketed 
specifically  in the united states  the fda and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions impose substantial requirements on new product research and the clinical development  manufacture and marketing of pharmaceutical products  including testing and clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of these products 
our and our collaborator s drug products will require regulatory approval before commercialization 
governments in other countries have similar requirements for testing  approval and marketing 
in the united states  in addition to meeting fda regulations  we are also subject to other federal  state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations  including regulation of the use and care of laboratory animals 
we plan to develop and commercialize selected drug candidates by ourselves and license other candidates to partners for further development and commercialization 
before marketing in the united states  any pharmaceutical or therapeutic product must undergo rigorous pre clinical testing and clinical trials and an extensive regulatory approval process implemented by the fda under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act 
the fda regulates  among other things  the development  testing  manufacture  safety and effectiveness standards  record keeping  labeling  storage  export  advertising  promotion  sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products 
the regulatory review and approval process  which includes pre clinical testing and clinical trials of each product candidate  is lengthy and uncertain 
securing fda approval requires the submission of extensive pre clinical and clinical data and supporting information to the fda for each indication to establish a product candidate s safety and effectiveness 
additional animal studies  other pre clinical or clinical trials may be requested by the fda  which may delay marketing approval 
the approval process takes many years  requires the expenditure of substantial resources and may involve ongoing requirements for post marketing studies or other conditions that may restrict marketing 
before commencing clinical investigations in humans in the united states  we or our collaborators must submit an investigational new drug  or ind  application to the fda 
clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases  although the phases may overlap or be combined 
phase represents the initial administration of the drug to a small group of humans  either healthy volunteers or patients  to test for safety  dosage tolerance  absorption  metabolism  excretion and clinical pharmacology 
phase involves studies in patients to begin to assess the effectiveness of the product  to ascertain dose tolerance and the optimal dose range and to gather additional data relating to safety and potential adverse effects 
once a drug is found to have some effectiveness and an acceptable safety profile in the targeted patient population  phase studies are initiated to establish safety and effectiveness in an expanded patient population and at multiple clinical study sites 
the fda may require further post marketing studies  referred to as phase studies 
the fda reviews both the clinical plans and the results of the trials and we  our collaborators or the fda may decide that clinical trials should be discontinued at any time if any significant safety issues are identified 
clinical testing must meet requirements for institutional review board or ethics committee oversight  informed consent  good clinical practices and other fda or other regulatory authority oversight 
the length of time necessary to complete clinical trials varies significantly and is difficult to predict 
clinical results are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations that may delay  limit or prevent regulatory approvals 
additional factors that may cause delay  termination or increased cost of our or our collaborators clinical trials include  among other factors lack of effectiveness of the product being tested adverse medical effects or side effects in treated patients slow patient enrollment in the clinical trials inadequately trained or insufficient personnel at the study site to assist in overseeing and monitoring the clinical trial delays in approval from a study site s institutional review board longer treatment time required to demonstrate effectiveness or to determine the appropriate product dose lack of sufficient supplies of the product candidate if pre clinical and clinical studies are successful  the results  together with other information about the product and its manufacture  are submitted to the fda in the form of a new drug application  or nda  to request marketing approval 
before receiving fda approval to market a product  we or our collaborators must demonstrate that the product is safe and effective through clinical trials on the patient population that will be treated 
the approval process is likely to require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that any approval will be granted on a timely basis  if at all 
additional animal studies or clinical trials may be requested during the fda review period that may delay marketing approval 
as part of the approval process  each manufacturing facility must be inspected by the fda 
among the conditions of approval is the requirement that a manufacturer s quality control and manufacturing procedures conform with federally mandated current good manufacturing practices  or cgmps 
both before and after approval  manufacturers must expend time  money and effort to ensure compliance with cgmps  and the fda conducts periodic inspections to certify such compliance 
violations may result in restrictions on the product or manufacturer  including costly recalls or withdrawal of the product from the market  or other enforcement action 
if regulatory approval of a product is granted by the fda  this approval will be limited to those specific conditions for which the product is approved  as demonstrated through clinical studies 
after fda approval for the initial indications  further clinical trials will be necessary to gain approval for the use of the product for additional indications 
marketing or promoting a drug for an unapproved indication is prohibited 
the fda requires that adverse effects be reported to the fda and may also require post marketing testing to monitor for adverse effects  which can involve significant expense 
even after fda approvals are obtained  a marketed product is subject to continual review 
later discovery of previously unknown information or failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restriction on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions 
furthermore  failure to obtain reimbursement coverage from governmental or third party insurers may adversely impact successful commercialization 
our access to and use of human or other tissue samples in our research and development efforts are subject to government regulation  both in the united states and abroad 
united states and foreign government agencies may also impose restrictions on the use of data derived from human or other tissue samples 
if our access to or use of human tissue samples  or our collaborator s use of data derived from such samples  is restricted  our business could suffer 
additionally  if we continue to develop our plant or insect programs  we may become subject to different government regulations relating to agricultural and industrial biotechnology products 
in addition to regulations enforced by the fda  we are also subject to regulation under the occupational safety and health act  the environmental protection act  the toxic substances control act  the resource conservation and recovery act  the controlled substances act and other present and potential future federal  state or local regulations 
our research and development programs involve the controlled use of hazardous materials  chemicals  biological materials and various radioactive compounds 
although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of such materials comply with the standards prescribed by state and federal regulations  the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be completely eliminated 
in the event of such an accident  we could be held liable for any damages that result  and the extent of that liability could exceed our resources 
we are currently building a chemical development facility that will be used for process scale up  manufacture of intermediates and compounds for research purposes as well as the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished drug products that meet the requirements of cgmp for use in clinical trials 
the fda and other regulatory authorities require that clinical and commercial products be manufactured according to cgmp regulations 
in addition  drug manufacturing facilities in the state of california must be inspected and licensed by the california department of health services in compliance with state regulatory requirements 
california law prohibits the shipment of product from a manufacturing facility for any clinical testing or commercial use prior to satisfaction of licensing requirements 
we are in the process of preparing for an inspection later this year by the state of california  however  there can be no assurance that we will obtain a license  or obtain it in a timely manner 
research research activities are important to our business 
research expenses related to the development of our technology and services and the improvement of our existing technology totaled million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  compliance with environmental regulations we believe that our operations comply in all material respects with the applicable environmental laws and regulations 
our compliance with these requirements did not and is not expected to have a material effect upon our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position 
sources and availability of raw materials in general  we purchase raw materials and supplies on the open market 
substantially all such materials are obtainable from a number of sources so that the loss of any one source of supply would not have a material adverse effect on us 
however  we currently only have one source of supply for the active pharmaceutical ingredient for our lead development project 
the loss of that supply would temporarily delay our lead development project 
employees as of march   we employed people  including in research and development and in administration 
none of our employees is covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
we consider our relationship with our employees to be good

risk factors an investment in our stock involves a high degree of risk 
investors evaluating us and our business should carefully consider the factors described below and all other information contained in this annual report on form k this annual report and in our other public filings before purchasing our stock 
any of the following factors could materially harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
additional factors and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial could also harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
investors could lose all or part of their investment as a result of these factors 
we have a history of losses and limited revenues we incorporated in april we had losses of million for the year ended december  through december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
our losses have resulted in large part from the significant research and development expenditures we have made in seeking to identify and validate new drug targets and new drug leads 
we rely on our collaborative and license agreements for our revenues  and we expect to continue to experience significant operating losses in the near term even if we or our collaborators successfully identify potential drug targets and drug leads 
if the time required to generate revenues and to achieve sustained profitability is longer than we anticipate  or if we are unable to obtain necessary funds  we may never achieve sustained profitability and may have to discontinue  or significantly curtail  our operations 
our revenues are contingent upon the decisions of our collaborators one of our strategies is to use our technologies to generate meaningful revenues from our collaborative and license agreements 
through december   a significant percentage of our revenues have been derived from one of our collaborators  eli lilly 
the research portion of our collaboration with eli lilly is scheduled to be completed on april  we expect a majority of our revenues through april   to be derived from eli lilly and merck and after april   from merck  absent any new collaborations 
our ability to generate revenues depends on our ability to enter into additional collaborative and license agreements with other parties and to maintain our existing agreements 
we will receive little or no revenues under our agreements if our own or our collaborators research  development or marketing efforts are unsuccessful  or if our agreements are terminated early 
merck can terminate the collaborative research program under our agreement or the entire agreement under the circumstances detailed in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included below in this annual report 
in the event of any such termination  our revenues would be materially adversely affected 
our receipt of revenues from collaborative arrangements will be significantly affected by the amount of time and effort expended by our collaborators  the timing of the identification of useful drug targets  the timing of the discovery of drug leads and the development of drug candidates 
under our existing agreements  we may not earn significant milestone payments until our collaborators have advanced products into clinical testing  which may not occur for many years  if ever 
we do not control the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators devote to our collaborative programs  potential products or product rights 
furthermore  we lack sales and marketing experience and may depend on our collaborators to market any drugs that we develop with them 
conflicts may arise between us and our collaborators  such as conflicts concerning ownership rights to particular receptor targets  drug leads or drug candidates 
while our existing collaborative agreements typically provide that we receive milestone and royalty payments with respect to drugs developed from our collaborative programs  disputes may arise over the application of payment provisions to these drugs and any royalty payments may be at reduced rates 
if any of our collaborators breach  terminate or fail to renew their collaborative agreements with us  the pre clinical or clinical development or commercialization of the affected drug candidates or research programs could be delayed or terminated 
our collaborative agreements generally include circumstances that would allow either party to terminate the agreements with advance written notice of that party s intent to terminate 
in addition  our collaborators have the right to terminate the collaborative agreements under some circumstances in which we do not 
in some circumstances  our collaborators can continue to use our technology after our agreements are terminated 
our collaborators may choose to use alternative technologies or develop alternative drugs either on their own or with other collaborators  including our competitors  in order to treat diseases that are targeted by collaborative arrangements with us 
our collaborative agreements typically do not prohibit these activities 
consolidation in the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industry could have an adverse effect on us by reducing the number of potential collaborators or jeopardizing our existing relationships 
we may not be able to enter into any new collaborative agreements 
also  our existing collaborators may decide to reduce or curtail their collaborations with us because of changes in their research and development budgets 
our largest stockholders may take actions that are contrary to your interests a small number of our stockholders hold a majority of the voting power of our outstanding stock  and biotechnology value fund  lp  biotechnology value fund ii  lp  bvf investments  lp  bvf partners lp  and bvf inc collectively  bvf own or control approximately of our outstanding stock 
these stockholders interests could differ from the interests of other stockholders  and they could be in a position to influence us to act in a way that is detrimental to the interests of other stockholders 
their actions and votes would be important  and possibly determinative  in the event we consider a transaction that requires stockholder approval or in the event a third party makes a tender offer and or a hostile take over offer for outstanding shares 
in addition  sales by these stockholders of a large number of shares of our common stock could adversely affect our stock s market price 
on january   we entered into an agreement with bvf and investment  llc collectively with bvf  the bvf stockholders  which provides for  among other things  a time limited standstill that provides that the bvf stockholders will not  on their own or as part of a larger group  i acquire our stock or assets  ii solicit proxies or submit stockholder proposals except as provided in such agreement  or iii engage in any of the actions set forth in paragraphs a through j of item of schedule d 
under the agreement  the standstill will last at least until october   but may be extended if we exercise certain rights to purchase a portion of their stock at prices that may be above market before october  if we do not exercise such rights  the bvf stockholders will have the right to call a special meeting of arena stockholders 
given the bvf stockholders percentage of ownership  it is likely that they along with a small number of other stockholders would be able to determine the results of any vote at such meeting 
we are in the very early stage of drug discovery and development  and if problems arise in the testing and approval process  our drug development efforts may not be successful 
developing drug leads  drug candidates and drugs is highly uncertain and subject to significant risks 
in order to receive some of the milestone payments under our collaborative agreements  we or our collaborators must successfully complete pre clinical and clinical trials of drug candidates discovered using our technologies 
we have identified only a few drug leads  all of which are in the very early stages of development and none of which have completed the development process 
our access to and use of some human or other tissue samples in our research and development efforts is subject to government regulation in the united states and abroad 
united states and foreign government agencies may also impose restrictions on the use of data derived from human or other tissue samples 
we or our collaborators may rely on third party clinical investigators at medical institutions to conduct our clinical trials  and may rely on other third party organizations to perform data collection and analysis 
as a result  we may face delays outside of our control 
it may take us or our collaborators many years to complete any pre clinical or clinical trials  and failure can occur at any stage of testing 
interim results of trials do not necessarily predict final results  and acceptable results in early trials may not be repeated in later trials 
moreover  if and when our programs reach clinical trials  we or our collaborators may decide to  or be required to  discontinue development of any or all of these projects at any time for commercial  scientific or other reasons 
in order to receive royalty payments from our collaborators  we or our collaborators must receive approval from regulatory agencies to market drugs discovered using our technologies 
a new drug may not be sold in the united states until the fda has approved a new drug application  or an nda 
when a drug receives an approved nda  the approval is limited to the labeling approved in the nda for those disease states and conditions for which the drug candidate has been demonstrated through clinical trials to be safe and effective 
drug candidates developed by us or our collaborators may not prove to be safe and effective in clinical trials and may not meet all of the applicable regulatory requirements necessary to receive marketing approval 
we do not expect any drugs resulting from our own or our collaborators research to be commercially available for many years  if ever 
drug discovery and development is an intensely competitive business that could render our technologies obsolete or noncompetitive the main focus of our efforts is gpcrs 
because gpcrs are an important target class for drug discovery efforts  we believe that most pharmaceutical companies  several biotechnology companies  and other organizations have internal drug discovery programs focused on gpcrs 
another company  an organization or an individual could have  or could develop  a technology using gpcrs to discover and develop drug leads or drug candidates more effectively  more efficiently or at a lower cost than our technologies 
such a technology could render our technologies  in particular cart and melanophore technologies  obsolete or noncompetitive 
many of the drugs that we or our collaborators are attempting to discover and develop would compete with existing therapies 
in addition  many companies are pursuing the development of drugs that target the same diseases and conditions that we are targeting such as metabolic diseases  cardiovascular diseases  central nervous system disorders and inflammation diseases 
our competitors may use discovery technologies and techniques or partner with collaborators in order to develop drug leads  drug candidates and drugs more efficiently or successfully  or with less cost  than we or our collaborators are able to do 
many of our competitors  particularly large pharmaceutical companies  have substantially greater research and development capabilities and greater financial  scientific and human resources than we do 
companies that complete clinical trials  obtain required regulatory agency approvals and commence commercial sale of their drugs before we do may achieve a significant competitive advantage  including certain patent and fda marketing exclusivity rights 
we have not achieved any of these competitive advantages 
any results from our research and development efforts  or from our joint efforts with our existing or any future collaborators  may not compete successfully with existing products or therapies 
a dispute regarding the infringement or misappropriation of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of others could be costly and result in delays in our research and development activities our success depends  in part  on our ability to operate without infringing on or misappropriating the proprietary rights of others 
there are many issued patents and patent applications filed by third parties relating to products or processes that could be determined to be similar or identical to ours or our licensors  and others may be filed in the future 
our activities  or those of our licensors or collaborators  may infringe patents owned by others 
although the government sponsored project to sequence the human genome has made genomics information freely available to the public  other organizations  companies and individuals are seeking proprietary positions on genomics information that overlap with the government sponsored project 
our activities  or those of our licensors or collaborators  could be affected by conflicting positions that may exist between any overlapping genomics information made available publicly as a result of the government sponsored project and genomics information that other organizations  companies or individuals consider to be proprietary 
there could be significant litigation and other administrative proceedings in our industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
any legal action against us  or our collaborators  claiming damages or seeking to enjoin commercial activities relating to the affected products or our methods or processes could require us  or our collaborators  to obtain a license to continue to use  manufacture or market the affected products  methods or processes  which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms  if ever prevent us from importing  making  using  selling or offering to sell the subject matter claimed in patents held by others and subject us to potential liability for damages consume a substantial portion of our managerial  scientific and financial resources result in litigation or administrative proceedings that may be costly  regardless of the outcome in addition  third parties may infringe on or misappropriate our proprietary rights  and we may have to institute costly legal action to protect our intellectual property rights 
we may not be able to afford the costs of enforcing our intellectual property rights against third parties 
our success is dependent on intellectual property rights held by us and third parties and our interest in these rights is complex and uncertain our success will depend in large part on our own and  to some extent  on our collaborators abilities to obtain  secure and defend patents 
we have numerous united states and foreign patent applications pending for our technologies  including patent applications on drug lead discovery techniques using cart  genetically altered gpcrs  gpcrs that we have discovered  new uses for previously discovered gpcrs  compounds discovered using cart  and melanophore technology 
the procedures for obtaining an issued patent in the united states and in most foreign countries are complex 
these procedures require an analysis of the scientific technology related to the invention and many legal issues 
consequently  we expect that the analysis of our patent applications will be complex and time consuming 
therefore  our patent position is very uncertain and we do not know when  or if  we will obtain additional issued patents for our technologies 
more consistent policies regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology patents have begun to emerge in the last few years 
for example  on january   the united states patent and trademark office issued finalized utility examination guidelines to its patent examiners that focus on what can be patented under united states patent law 
these guidelines are beginning to be implemented in a more consistent fashion and primarily impact the procedures that are used in determining the types of inventions that can be patented and the minimum threshold of information necessary to patent inventions in the fields of biotechnology and chemistry 
we still do not completely know to what extent these guidelines will ultimately affect our patents or those of our competitors and collaborators as the application of these guidelines have yet to be challenged in the courts 
we also rely on trade secrets to protect our technologies 
however  trade secrets are difficult to protect 
we require all of our employees to agree not to improperly use our trade secrets or disclose them to others  but we may be unable to determine if our employees have conformed or will conform with their legal obligations under these agreements 
we also require collaborators and consultants to enter into confidentiality agreements  but we may not be able to adequately protect our trade secrets or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use or disclosure or the lawful development by others of this information 
many of our employees and consultants were  and many of them may currently be  parties to confidentiality agreements with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  and the use of our technologies could violate these agreements 
in addition  third parties may independently discover our trade secrets or proprietary information 
technology licensed to us by others  or in licensed technology  is important to some aspects of our business 
with a few exceptions  we generally do not control the patent prosecution  maintenance or enforcement of in licensed technology 
accordingly  we are unable to exercise the same degree of control over in licensed technology as we do over our internally developed technologies 
moreover  some of our academic institution licensors  research collaborators and scientific advisors have rights to publish data and information to which we have rights 
if we cannot maintain the confidentiality of our technologies and other confidential information in connection with our collaborations  then our ability to receive patent protection or protect our proprietary information will be impaired 
we may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights outside the united states patent law outside the united states is uncertain and in many countries is currently undergoing review and revision  particularly with respect to biotechnology related inventions 
the laws of some countries do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as united states laws 
it may be necessary or useful for us to participate in proceedings to determine the validity of our  or our competitors  foreign patents  which could result in substantial cost and divert our efforts and attention from other aspects of our business 
we have recently been notified that the japanese patent office issued a notification of reasons for revocation of our japanese patent on our melanophore technology 
we are investigating the facts relating to this notification and intend to oppose any revocation 
if some or all of our patent claims are revoked  we may not be able to exclude others from using our melanophore technology in japan 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate and may cause our stock price to decline our revenues and results of operations may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter  depending on a variety of the factors described in this annual report including entering into a new collaboration or modifying or terminating an existing collaboration the timing of and receipt by us of milestone and royalty payments the timing of discovery of drug leads and the development of drug candidates  if any changes in the research and development budgets of our existing collaborators or potential collaborators others introducing new drug discovery techniques or new drugs that target the same diseases and conditions that we or our collaborators target regulatory actions expenses related to  and the results of  litigation and other proceedings relating to intellectual property rights or other matters we are not able to control these factors 
period to period comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily indicative of our future performance 
if our revenues in a particular period do not meet analysts or stockholders expectations  our stock price may decline and such decline could be significant 
we will need additional capital in the future to sufficiently fund our operations and research and development and we may not be able to obtain additional capital on terms favorable to us we have consumed substantial amounts of capital to date and we expect our operating expenses over the next several years will be significant and possibly increase as we continue to build our facilities and infrastructure and pursue our research and development activities 
although we believe that our current funds will be sufficient to support our current operating plan through at least the next two years  we may require additional financing sooner 
for example  we may use a portion of our funds to acquire businesses or technologies 
in addition  if we are successful in developing drug leads  our capital requirements will be much greater than our current capital 
financing may not be available or may not be available on terms that are favorable to us 
to the extent that we raise additional funds through collaborative and licensing arrangements  we may be required to relinquish some rights to our technologies or drug leads  or grant licenses on terms that are unfavorable to us 
any further equity financing we do obtain would result in dilution to our then existing stockholders 
we may also raise additional funds through the incurrence of debt  and the holders of any debt we may issue would have rights superior to your rights 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to significantly curtail or eliminate one or more of our drug development programs  or to completely discontinue our operations 
our chemical development facility will be subject to various laws  rules and regulations and we may not obtain necessary licenses to operate the facility we are currently building a chemical development facility that will be used for process scale up  manufacture of intermediates and compounds for research purposes as well as the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished drug products that meet the requirements of cgmp for use in clinical trials 
the fda and other regulatory authorities require that clinical and commercial products be manufactured according to cgmp regulations 
in addition  drug manufacturing facilities in the state of california must be inspected and licensed by the california department of health services in compliance with state regulatory requirements 
california law prohibits the shipment of product from a manufacturing facility for any clinical testing or commercial use prior to satisfaction of licensing requirements 
we are in the process of preparing for an inspection later this year by the state of california  however  there can be no assurance that we will obtain a license  or obtain it in a timely manner 
we may engage in strategic transactions that could impact our liquidity from time to time we consider strategic transactions  such as acquisitions of companies  asset purchases and or out licensing or in licensing compounds developed by us or others 
these additional potential transactions may include a variety of different business arrangements  including spin offs  acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures  restructurings  divestitures  business combinations and investments 
any such transaction may require us to incur non recurring or other charges  may increase our near and long term expenditures and may pose significant integration challenges or disrupt our management or business  which could harm our business and financial results 
anti takeover provisions in our rights agreement and charter documents and under delaware law could delay or prevent a change in management or a takeover attempt that you may consider to be in your best interest we have adopted certain anti takeover provisions  including a stockholders rights plan  dated as of october   between us and computershare trust company  inc  as rights agent the rights agreement 
the rights agreement is not intended to prevent an acquisition of us at a full and fair price 
rather  it is intended to deter an attempt to acquire us in a manner or on terms not approved by our board of directors  and will cause substantial dilution to any person who attempts to acquire us in a manner or on terms not so approved 
the issuance of preferred stock under the terms of the rights agreement may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 
additionally  provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by laws  as well as some provisions of delaware law  could delay or prevent the removal of directors and could make more difficult a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving us 
our research and development efforts will be seriously jeopardized if we are unable to attract and retain key employees our success depends  in part  on the continued contributions of our principal management and scientific personnel  and we face intense competition for such personnel 
in particular  our research programs depend on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled scientists 
if we lose the services of any of our key personnel as well as other principal members of our scientific or management staff  our research and development or management efforts could be interrupted or significantly delayed 
we could also encounter increasing difficulty in attracting enough qualified personnel as our operations expand and the demand for these professionals increases  and this difficulty could impede the attainment of our research and development objectives 
we use biological and hazardous materials our research and development activities involve the controlled use of potentially harmful biological materials as well as hazardous materials  chemicals and various radioactive compounds 
for example  we use radioactive phosphorous and sodium cyanide on a regular basis 
we cannot completely eliminate the risk of accidental contamination  which could cause an interruption of our research and development efforts injury to our employees and others resulting in the payment of damages environmental damage resulting in costly cleanup liabilities under federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the use  storage  handling and disposal of these materials and specified waste products our operations might be interrupted by the occurrence of a natural disaster  war  terrorist attack or other catastrophic event we depend on our customers  and our laboratories and other facilities for the continued operation of our business 
natural disasters or other catastrophic events  including  war  terrorist attacks  earthquakes and problems that could arise during the construction and operation of our chemical development facility  could disrupt our operations or those of our customers 
even though we carry business interruption insurance  and our contractors may carry liability insurance  that protect us in certain events  we might suffer losses as a result of business interruptions that exceed the coverage available under our and our contractors insurance policies or for which we or our contractors do not have coverage 
any natural disaster or catastrophic event could have a significant negative impact on our operations and financial results 
item properties 
the facilities that we occupy consist of approximately  square feet of research and office space located at  and nancy ridge drive  san diego  california 
at our nancy ridge drive facility  we lease approximately  square feet of space  of which  square feet is laboratory space and  square feet is office space 
in  we purchased the nancy ridge drive facility whose square footage is approximately  square feet and consists of  square feet of laboratory space and  square feet of office space 
in march  we entered into a lease for our nancy ridge drive facility which is approximately  square feet of space  and approximately  square feet is laboratory space and  square feet is office space 
we subleased approximately  square feet  primarily office space  of the facility to chemnavigator  a related party  at the then current market rates 
in november  we acquired a  square foot facility at nancy ridge drive 
we are currently converting this facility into a chemical development facility 
also in november  we acquired a  square foot facility at nancy ridge drive and leased it back to the previous owner until mid february we are evaluating options for this facility  including  among others  expanding it and developing for our own use  subleasing it or selling it 
we believe these facilities will be adequate to meet our near term space requirements to accommodate our growth through in march  we entered into an agreement to sell one of our occupied facilities and to lease it back from the purchaser 
the sale is subject to a number of conditions  including the purchaser s due diligence and us agreeing on a form of lease 
accordingly  the proposed sale may not occur 
the agreement contemplates a sale price of approximately million  and initial annual lease payment of approximately million  which payment will be increased by each year
