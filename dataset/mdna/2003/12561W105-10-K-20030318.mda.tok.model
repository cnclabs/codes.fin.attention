cleco power management s narrative analysis of the results of operations the following narrative analysis should be read in combination with the financial statements and notes of cleco power contained in item of this report 
cleco power is providing the following narrative analysis of the results of its operations in lieu of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in accordance with instruction i a to form k omission of information by certain wholly owned subsidiaries 
general factors affecting cleco power revenue is primarily affected by the following factors retail rates for residential  commercial  and industrial customers and other retail sales are regulated by the lpsc 
retail rates consist of a base rate and a fuel rate 
base rates are designed to allow recovery of the cost of providing service and a return on utility assets 
fuel revenue rates fluctuate while generally allowing recovery of  with no profit  the costs of purchased power and fuel used to generate electricity 
rates for transmission service and wholesale power sales are regulated by the ferc 
an lpsc approved rate stabilization plan is in place through september this plan effectively allows cleco power the opportunity to realize a regulatory rate of return of up to 
as part of the rate stabilization plan  the lpsc annually reviews revenue and return on equity 
a new plan may be ordered by the lpsc upon expiration of the existing plan  or the existing plan may be extended with or without modification 
cleco power anticipates discussions with the lpsc staff regarding the status of the plan will begin in late for additional information on cleco power s rate stabilization plan  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition retail rates of cleco power on pages of the annual report to shareholders  which is filed as exhibit to this report and incorporated herein by reference 
energy trading  net  generally is affected by supply and demand in the market  the financial viability of cleco power s marketing and trading counterparties  and the volatility in market prices 
during the third quarter of  cleco power began an assessment of its speculative trading strategy 
this assessment was completed during the fourth quarter of  and it was determined  in light of market conditions and other factors  that cleco power would discontinue speculative trading activities 
most of cleco power s exposure to the market from positions opened prior to the change in strategy was mitigated in the fourth quarter of by transactions entered into specifically to offset those open positions

residential customers demand for electricity is largely affected by weather 
weather is generally measured in cooling degree days and heating degree days 
a cooling degree day is an indication of the likelihood that a consumer will use air conditioning  while a heating degree day is an indication of the likelihood that a consumer will use heating 
an increase in heating degree days does not produce the same increase in revenue as an increase in cooling degree days  because customers can choose an alternative fuel source for heating  such as natural gas 
normal heating degree days and cooling degree days are calculated for a month by separately calculating the average actual heating and cooling degree days for that month over a period of approximately years 
commercial and industrial customers demand for electricity is affected less by the weather and is primarily dependent upon the strength of the economy 
cleco power s two largest customers manufacture wood products  such as newsprint  cardboard  corrugated packaging and kraft paper 
sales to industrial customers are affected by the worldwide demand for the customers products compared to their ability to produce the products economically 
kwh sales to retail electric customers have grown an average of annually over the last five years  but cleco power expects this growth to range from to per year during the next five years 
the growth of future sales will depend upon factors such as weather conditions  customer conservation efforts  retail marketing and business development programs  and the economy of cleco power s service area 
some of the issues facing the electric utility industry that could affect sales include deregulation  retail wheeling  the transmission of power directly to a retail customer  as opposed to transmission via the interconnected transmission facilities of one or more intermediate facilities  possible transfer of transmission facilities to an rto  other legislative and regulatory changes  retention of large industrial customers and municipal franchises  changes in electric rates compared to customers ability to pay  and access to transmission systems 
fuel and power purchased are primarily affected by the following factors changes in fuel and purchased power expenses reflect fluctuations in fuel used for electric generation  fuel handling costs  availability of economical power for purchase  and deferral of expenses for recovery from customers through the fuel adjustment clause in subsequent months 
changes in fuel costs historically have not significantly affected cleco power s net income 
generally  fuel and purchased power expenses are recovered through the lpsc established fuel adjustment clause  which enables cleco power to pass on to customers substantially all such charges 
cleco power s fuel adjustment clause is regulated by the lpsc representing about of its total fuel costs and the ferc 
the lpsc staff has informed cleco power that it is planning to conduct a periodic fuel audit beginning in the first quarter of the audit  pursuant to the fuel adjustment clause general order issued november   in docket no 
u  is required to be performed no less frequently than every other year  however  this will be the first lpsc fuel adjustment clause audit of cleco power 
cleco power has not been informed which time period will be covered by the audit  nor is management able to predict the results of the lpsc fuel audit 
recovery of fuel adjustment clause costs is subject to refund until final approval is received from the lpsc upon completion of the periodic audit 
lpsc jurisdictional revenue recovered by cleco power through its fuel adjustment clause for the three years  five years  and seven years ending december   was million   million  and  million  respectively 
an earnings review settlement reached with the lpsc in sometimes requires accruals for estimated customer credits  depending on cleco power s level of earnings 
the amount of credit due customers  if any  is determined annually by the lpsc based on results for the month period ending september of each year 
cleco power accrued million in for estimated customer credits compared to million in the million accrual relates to the month cycles ended september    and for additional information on the accrual for estimated customer credits  see the notes to cleco power s financial statements  note accrual of estimated customer credits in item of this report 
cleco power obtains coal and lignite through long term contracts and through the spot market 
natural gas is purchased under short term contracts 
cleco power has power contracts with two power marketing companies  williams energy and dynegy  for a total of mw of capacity in and in  increasing to mw of capacity in  decreasing to mw of capacity in because substantially all of the contracts expire on december   cleco power is currently evaluating its long term capacity and energy needs 
cleco power anticipates it will initiate a solicitation during the first quarter of to identify existing or new generation resources  including new power purchase contracts  to replace the williams energy contracts and the dynegy contract 
pursuant to the lpsc s general order governing the construction and or procurement of generation capacity  c leco power is required to make an informational filing with the lpsc to substantiate that securing such generation resources is in the public interest 
cleco power anticipates making such a filing during the first quarter of and will continue to evaluate supply options through the first half of as part of that process  cleco power will also evaluate the possibility of acquiring additional generation facilities  including one or more of midstream s unregulated power plants 
in addition to the power obtained under long term contracts  cleco power purchases power from other utilities and other marketers to supplement its generation at times of relatively high demand or when the purchase price of the power is less than cleco power s cost of generation 
however  transmission capacity must be available to transport the purchased power to cleco power s system in order for it to be able to utilize the power 
during  of cleco power s energy requirements was met with purchased power  up from in and in in future years  cleco power s power plants may not be able to supply enough power to meet its growing native load 
because of its location on the transmission grid  cleco power relies on one main supplier of electric transmission  and constraints sometimes limit the amount of purchased power it can bring into its system 
the power contracts described above may be affected by these transmission constraints

other expenses are primarily affected by the following factors the majority of other expenses include other operations  maintenance  depreciation  and taxes other than income taxes 
other operations expenses are affected by  among other things  the cost of employee benefits  insurance expenses  and the costs associated with providing customer service 
maintenance expenses associated with cleco power s plants generally are driven by the physical characteristics of the plants  as well as planned preventive maintenance 
depreciation expenses are primarily affected by the cost of the facility in service  the time the facility was placed in service  and the estimated useful life of the facility 
taxes other than income taxes are generally affected by payroll taxes and ad valorem taxes 
results of operations year ended december   compared to year ended december  cleco power s net income applicable to member s equity for was million compared to million for factors contributing to the slight increase include higher base revenue from retail customer sales  lower operating expenses  and higher wholesale revenue 
these were partially offset by lower margins from energy trading  net  lower interest income  higher interest expense  and the organizational restructuring charge

in the fourth quarter of  cleco power began to use temperature data collected by the noaa for this purpose 
cooling and heating degree days for have been adjusted to reflect the change in temperature data source 
for the year ended december  cooling degree days increase decrease from normal increase decrease from prior year heating degree days increase decrease from normal increase decrease from prior year base base revenue increased million  or  from to the increase was primarily due to higher retail sales resulting from customer growth and increased cooling degree days and heating degree days compared to normal and prior year  as shown in the chart above 
the increase in sales for resale volume was primarily due to the addition of one wholesale customer in june and the addition of a second wholesale customer in january fuel cost recovery fuel cost recovery revenue collected from customers decreased million  or  primarily as a result of a decrease in the average per unit cost of fuel used for electric generation and a decrease in the average per unit cost of purchased power for compared to  which made the purchase of power more economical than the incremental cost of generation of power

energy trading  net for compared to  the increase in power and gas volumes traded was primarily due to expansion of cleco power s power and gas trading portfolio 
during the third quarter of  cleco power began an assessment of its speculative trading strategy 
this assessment was completed during the fourth quarter of  and it was determined  in light of market conditions and other factors  that cleco power would discontinue speculative trading activities 
most of cleco power s exposure to the market from positions opened prior to the change in strategy was mitigated in the fourth quarter of by transactions entered into specifically to offset those open positions

intercompany revenue intercompany revenue decreased million  or  in compared to the decrease was primarily due to a change in the billing process to an affiliate and reduced billings to other affiliates for software usage 
operating expenses operating expenses decreased million  or  in compared to in compared to fuel used for electric generation decreased million  or  primarily due to the following factors a decrease in the average per unit cost of fuel from per mmbtu in to per mmbtu in  an increase in power purchased for utility customers  and a million one time adjustment in for the recovery of fuel related costs that had not been collected previously from utility customers 
from to  power purchased for utility customers increased million  or  primarily due to a decrease in average per unit cost  which made the purchase of power more economical than the incremental cost of generation of power 
the million  or  decrease in other operations and maintenance expenses for compared to was primarily due to a decre ase in affiliate billings and to a decrease in administrative expenses as a result of a change in vacation policy between and depreciation expenses increased million  or  in compared to primarily due to normal asset additions such as line extensions and substation upgrades and new software 
also  an million organizational restructuring charge was incurred in for additional information on the restructuring charge  see the notes to cleco power s financial statements  note restructuring charge in item of this report 
taxes other than income taxes increased million  or  primarily due to increased payroll and ad valorem taxes 
interest income and expenses interest income decreased million  or  in compared to primarily due to interest related to the recognition in of a one time recovery of fuel related costs that had not been previously collected from utility customers 
because the recovery of the fuel related costs was a one time adjustment  management does not expect interest income in future periods to be as large as it was in interest expense increased million  or  primarily due to interest related to gas transportation charges

cleco power financial risk management the market risk inherent in cleco power s market risk sensitive instruments and positions includes the potential change arising from changes in interest rates  the commodity price of power traded on the different power exchanges and the commodity price of natural gas traded 
prior to the third quarter of  cleco power used eitf no 
to determine whether the market risk sensitive instruments and positions were required to be marked to market 
in october  the eitf rescinded eitf no 
effective the first fiscal period beginning after december  for additional information about the rescission of eitf no 
 see the notes to cleco power s financial statements  note summary of significant accounting policies recent accounting standards in item of this report 
cleco power currently uses sfas no 
in order to determine whether the market risk sensi tive instruments and positions are required to be marked to market 
generally  cleco power s market risk sensitive instruments and positions qualify for the normal purchase  normal sale exception to mark to market accounting of sfas no 
 since cleco power generally takes physical delivery and the instruments and positions are used to satisfy customer requirements 
cleco power does have some positions that are required to be marked to market because they do not meet the exceptions of sfas no 
and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
the positions entered into for marketing and trading purposes do not meet the exemptions of sfas no 
 and the net mark to market of those positions is recorded in income 
cleco power has entered into other positions to mitigate some of the volatility in fuel costs passed on to customers 
these positions are marked to market  with the resulting gain or loss recorded on the balance sheet as a component of the accumulated deferred fuel asset or liability 
when these positions close  actual gains or losses will be included in the fuel adjustment clause and reflected on customers bills 
cleco power s exposure to market risk  as discussed below  represents an estimate of possible changes in the fair value or future earnings that would occur  assuming possible future movements in the interest rates and commodity prices of power and natural gas 
management s views on market risk are not necessarily indicative of actual results  nor do they represent the maximum possible gains or losses 
the views do represent  within the parameters disclosed  what management estimates may happen 
interest cleco power has entered into various fixed and variable rate debt obligations 
for details  see the notes to cleco power s financial statements  note debt in item of this report 
the calculations of the changes in fair market value and interest expense of the debt securities are made over a one year period 
as of december   the carrying value of cleco power s long term  fixed rate debt was approximately million  with a fair market value of approximately million 
fair value was determined using quoted market prices 
each change in the average interest rates applicable to such debt would result in a change of approximately million in the fair values of these instruments 
if these instruments are held to maturity  no change in stated value will be realized 
as of december   the carrying value of cleco power s short term  variable rate debt was approximately million  which approximates the fair market value 
each change in the average interest rates applicable to such debt would result in a change of approximately million in cleco power s pretax earnings 
cleco power monitors its mix of fixed and variable rate debt obligations in light of changing market conditions and from time to time may alter that mix by  for example  refinancing balances outstanding under its variable rate credit facility with fixed rate debt 
market risk cleco power s management believes it has controls in place to help minimize the risks involved in trading 
controls over trading consist of a back office accounting and a middle office risk management independent of the trading operations  oversight by a risk management committee comprised of officers  and a daily risk report which shows var and current market conditions 
cleco s board of directors appoints the members of the risk management committee 
var limits are set and monitored by the risk management committee 
cleco power engages in trading of power and natural gas  provides fuel for generation  and purchases power to meet the power demands of customers 
financial positions that are not used to meet the power demands of customers are marked to market as required by sfas no 
for the year ended december   the net mark to market amount for these positions was a loss of million 
during the third quarter of cleco power began an assessment of its speculative trading strategies 
this assessment was completed during the fourth quarter of  and cleco power determined  in light of market conditions and other factors  that it would discontinue speculative trading activities 
cleco power has entered into positions to mitigate some of the volatility in fuel costs passed on to customers  as permitted by a lpsc order 
these positions are marked to market  with the resulting gain or loss recorded on the balance sheet as a component of the accumulated deferred fuel asset or liability 
at december   the net mark to market impact was a loss of million 
cleco power utilizes a var model to assess the market risk of its trading portfolios  including derivative financial instruments 
var represents the potential loss in fair values for an instrument from adverse changes in market factors for a specified period of time and confidence level 
the var is estimated using a historical simulation calculated daily assuming a holding period of one day  with a confidence level for natural gas and power positions 
total volatility is based on historical cash volatility  implied market volatility  current cash volatility  and option pricing 
based on these assumptions  the high  low and average var for cleco power for  as well as the var at december   and  is summarized below for the year ended december  at december  high low average thousands thousands cleco power the decrease in var from december  compared to december   is primarily due to a decrease in trading activity as a result of cleco power s decision to no longer engage in speculative trading activities 
under its var model  cleco power considers changes in market value of its open positions in excess of  over its estimated var to be material 
during  cleco power experienced one day in which there was such an excess  which was  the following table summarizes the market value maturities of contracts with prices actively traded at december  with respect to cleco power fair value of contracts at period end contractual obligations maturity less than one year maturity years maturity over three years total fair value thousands assets liabilities
