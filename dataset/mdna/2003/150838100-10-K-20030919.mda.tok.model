item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview celadon group  inc  through its operating subsidiaries  provides truckload transportation services in and between the nafta countries of the united states  mexico and canada 
we deliver our services through a network of owned and leased tractors and  to a lesser extent  independent owner operators 
we excel in service  safety and technology as we move time sensitive freight in and between the united states  canada and mexico 
consistent with our focus on technology to improve our core businesses  we also operate truckersbb  inc  a profitable e procurement business that passes on volume purchasing power to more than  member fleets to provide discounts on fuel  tire and other related services 
we continually evaluate our acquisition opportunities in order to expand our core business and improve the quality of our customer service 
we believe that current economic conditions will lead to additional consolidation in the industry  and we feel that we are well positioned to take advantage of that consolidation 
consistent with our strategy  we acquired certain assets of burlington motor carriers in we believe acquisitions  such as this  improve our lane density  customer base  service offerings and operating results 
recent acquisitions and divestitures in august  the company purchased certain assets of highway express  inc highway 
the assets of highway consisted of approximately tractors  trailers  trade receivables and other assets 
the purchase price of approximately million consisted of million cash and a million note payable over thirty six months 
the company used borrowings under its existing credit agreement to fund the cash portion of the acquisition 
we expect this acquisition to strengthen the company s regional presence and lane density in the southeast  enhance our consumer non durable customer base  and should increase our rate per mile 
highway s revenue for fiscal was approximately million 
in march  we purchased certain fixed assets of burlington motor carriers  consisting primarily of approximately tractors and trailers  and we incurred million in notes payable related to the transaction 
in june  we sold certain assets and the owner operator and agent contracts of cheetah transportation  inc to american trans freight 
cheetah  a flatbed truckload carrier operating out of mooresville  north carolina  was divested due to its lack of strategic fit with our focus on van truckload operations 
we recognized a million loss on disposition  which included a non cash charge of million  related to the net book value of goodwill and other intangibles 
cheetah had approximately owner operators and revenues of million in fiscal results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationship of revenue and expense items to operating revenues for the periods indicated 
fiscal year ended june  operating revenue operating expenses salaries  wages and employee benefits fuel operating costs and supplies insurance and claims depreciation and amortization rent and purchased transportation general  administrative  and selling expenses cost of goods sold other operating expenses loss on disposition of flatbed division total operating expenses operating income other income expense interest expense  net other income expense  net minority interest in subsidiary loss income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss fiscal year ended june  compared with fiscal year ended june  revenue 
consolidated revenue increased by million  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal this increase is related to a increase in truckload volume and a increase in rate per mile 
dedicated operations for outsourced spotting services  which began in march  represented approximately million of this increase 
revenue for truckersbb was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the truckersbb revenue increase is primarily related to an increase in member usage of various programs including the tire discount program 
operating income 
consolidated operating income increased by million  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal the increase in operating income was primarily a result of increased revenue and decreased rent and purchased transportation and general  administrative  and selling expense 
this was partially offset by increased salaries  wages and employee benefits  fuel  and insurance expense 
truckload operating income increased by million  to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal our operating ratio  which expresses operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue  improved from in fiscal to in fiscal salaries  wages and benefits were million  or of operating revenues  for fiscal compared to for the same period in this increase is primarily related to a increase in company miles  which in turn increased driver paid miles

fuel expenses increased to of revenue for fiscal compared to in fiscal fuel prices have increased approximately per gallon for fiscal compared to fiscal fuel prices continue to increase due to low inventory and unrest in the middle east 
increased fuel prices will increase our operating expenses to whatever extent they are not offset by surcharges 
operating costs and supplies increased to of revenue for fiscal compared to in fiscal operating costs and supplies consist of maintenance  tire expense and other direct operating expenses 
maintenance expenses increased in fiscal  as the average age per tractor increased to years from years and trailers increased to years from years 
as the age of our equipment has increased the cost to maintain the fleet has increased 
we expect our maintenance costs to decrease in conjunction with the reduction in the average age of the fleet in fiscal insurance and claims expense was in fiscal compared to for fiscal insurance consists of premiums for liability  physical damage and cargo damage insurance 
our insurance program involves self insurance at various risk retention levels 
claims in excess of these risk levels are covered by insurance in amounts we consider to be adequate 
we accrue for the uninsured portion of claims based on known claims and historical experience 
we continually revise and change our insurance program to maintain a balance between the increased rates industry wide and the risk retention we are willing to assume 
specific large dollar claims occurring in a period can have a significant negative impact on earnings 
rent and purchased transportation decreased million to of revenue for fiscal from for the same period in the decrease in fiscal is primarily related to reduced owner operator expense  as the company reduced the owner operator fleet by trucks for the year 
in addition  tractor costs have increased as new tractors financed by operating leases on a four year trade cycle were added 
we expect our cost of tractor and trailer ownership to increase in the future due to increased initial equipment prices and lower resale values on used equipment 
net interest expense 
net interest expense decreased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease was the result of lower interest rates offset by a one time non cash write off of loan origination costs of approximately thousand related to the company s previous credit facility 
the decrease was also the result of a percentage point decline in interest rates year over year and bank borrowings decreasing from million for fiscal to million for fiscal other income and expenses 
other income and expense includes approximately million of commission income related to a receivables collection agreement between foothill capital and the company

this decreased our pass through revenues in fiscal by approximately million 
adjusted for these items  last year s consolidated revenue would have been million 
on a comparable basis  excluding cheetah and the pass through revenues in the prior year  revenue for fiscal represented an increase of million  or approximately 
we experienced an increase of approximately million dispatch miles for fiscal related to a strengthening economy and a focused effort to add customers of bankrupt burlington motor carriers

also  as pass through revenue related to the mexican portion of loads decreased  the pass through purchased transportation expense has also decreased 
to offset these decreases  trailer costs rose as we continued to replace foot trailers with foot trailers 
in addition  tractor costs have increased as most new tractors have operating leases on a four year trade cycle

investing activities provided cash of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
this cash was provided by proceeds from the sale of property and equipment offset in part by the purchase of new property and equipment 
we used million and million for financing activities in fiscal and  respectively 
long term debt and capital lease obligations were reduced to million in fiscal from million for fiscal these uses were primarily for pay down of bank borrowings and capital lease obligations 
our primary capital requirements over the last three years have been funding the acquisition of equipment 
capital expenditures including the value of equipment procured under capital leases totaled million  million  and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
we purchased million  million  and million of revenue equipment under capitalized leases and other financing in fiscal  and  respectively 
we have historically and anticipate meeting our capital investment requirements with a combination of internally generated funds  bank financing  equipment lease financing both capitalized and operating and  to a lesser extent  the issuance of common stock 
this financing will depend on prevailing market conditions and other factors over which we have limited control  as well as our financial condition and results of operations 
on september   we entered into a loan and security agreement credit agreement with fleet capital corporation  fleet capital canada corporation and several other lenders named in the credit agreement 
the credit agreement provides to us  our canadian subsidiary and certain of our united states subsidiaries a credit facility in the aggregate amount of million 
the facility consists of two revolving loan facilities  two term loan subfacilities and a commitment to issue and guaranty letters of credit 
the term loan subfacilities consist of a domestic term loan in the aggregate principal amount of approximately million and a canadian term loan in the aggregate principal amount of approximately thousand 
repayment of the amounts outstanding under the credit agreement is secured by a lien on our assets and the assets of certain of our subsidiaries  including the stock or other equity interests of various subsidiaries 
in addition  certain of our subsidiaries that are not party to the credit agreement have guaranteed the repayment of the amount outstanding under the credit agreement  and have granted a lien on their respective assets to secure such repayment 
the credit agreement replaced in full the credit facility the company entered into with ing us capital  llc  in august the credit agreement  which is for a term of three years  terminates on september  amounts available under the credit agreement are determined based upon the company s borrowing base  as defined 
in addition  there are certain covenants  which restrict  among other things  the payment of cash dividends annual capital expenditures  annual lease payments  and requires the company to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio along with certain financial ratios and certain other financial conditions 
such borrowings are secured by a significant portion of the company s assets  primarily trade receivables 
at june   million of our credit facility was utilized as outstanding borrowings and million was utilized for standby letters of credit 
the average balance outstanding during fiscal was million and the highest balance outstanding was million 
at june   we also had cash payments of million for capital lease financing including interest rates ranging from to  maturing at various dates through of this amount  million of cash payments  including interest  is due prior to june as of june   our bank loans  capitalized leases  operating leases  other debts and future commitments have stated maturities or minimum annual payments as follows annual cash requirements as of june  in thousands amounts due by period less than one to three to over total one year three years five years five years operating leases      capital leases obligations    long term debt     sub total      future purchase of revenue equipment     employment and consulting agreements  standby letters of credit   total      included in these balances are residual guarantees of million in total and million coming due in less than one year 
we believe these balances will be satisfied by manufacturer commitments 
as of june   we had tractors on order for delivery in fiscal a commitment for lease financing on these tractors has been obtained 
management believes that there are presently adequate sources of secured equipment financing together with our existing credit facilities and cash flow from operations to provide sufficient funds to meet our anticipated working capital requirements 
additional growth in the tractor and trailer fleet beyond our existing orders will require additional sources of financing 
inflation many of our operating expenses  including fuel costs and revenue equipment  are sensitive to the effects of inflation  which result in higher operating costs and reduced operating income 
the effects of inflation on our business during the past three years were most significant in fuel 
the effects of inflation on revenue were not material in the past three years 
we have limited the effects of inflation through increases in freight rates and fuel surcharges 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make assumptions and estimates that can have a material impact on the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  and results of operations 
while management applies its judgment based on assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  actual results could vary from those assumptions  and it is possible that materially different amounts would be reported using differing assumptions 
we recognize revenue  driver s wages  fuel  and other direct operating expenses generally based on the date freight is delivered to the customer 
we depreciate our property and equipment using the straight line method over the estimated life of the asset 
we have historically depreciated tractors and trailers over four to twelve years with various salvage values 
gains and losses on disposal of revenue equipment are included in depreciation in the statement of operations 
long lived assets are depreciated over estimated useful lives based on our historical experience and prevailing industry practice 
estimated useful lives are periodically reviewed to ensure they remain appropriate 
long lived assets are tested for impairment whenever an event occurs that indicates an impairment may exist 
future cash flows and operating performance are used for analyzing impairment losses 
if the sum of expected undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognized 
the company measures the impairment loss by comparing the fair value of the asset to its carrying value 
fair value is determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis or appraised values as appropriate 
long lived assets that are held for sale are recorded at the lower of carrying value or the fair value less costs to sell 
over the last two years the majority of our revenue equipment additions have been financed via operating leases 
these leases contain residual value guarantees  which guarantee the lessor a negotiated amount at the end of the lease 
operating lease debt is carried off the balance sheet in accordance with sfas accounting for leases 
the company is self insured for most medical insurance claims  workers compensation claims  and bodily injury and property damage liability losses 
reported claims and related loss reserves are estimated by third party administrators 
claims incurred but not reported are recorded based on historical experience and industry trends  which are continually monitored  and accruals are adjusted when warranted by changes in facts and circumstances 
insurance and claims expense will vary from period to period based on the severity and frequency of claims incurred in a given period 
deferred taxes are recognized for the future tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting  based on enacted tax laws and rates 
federal income taxes are provided on the portion of the income of foreign subsidiaries that is expected to be remitted to the united states 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements 
code of ethics the company has adopted a code of ethics applicable to its principal executive officer  principal financial officer  principal accounting officer or controller or person performing similar functions 
the code is attached to this report as exhibit item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we experience various market risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and fuel prices 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes  nor when there are no underlying related exposures 
we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily from our credit agreement as of june  the credit agreement carries a maximum variable interest rate of the bank s base rate plus or libor plus 
at june   our variable interest rate averaged 
a hypothetical movement in this interest rate would have an impact on net income of approximately  in the event of a change of such magnitude  management would likely consider actions to further mitigate our exposure 
our foreign currency revenues are generally proportionate to our foreign currency expenses  and we do not generally engage in currency hedging transactions 
for purposes of consolidation  however  the operating results earned by our subsidiaries in foreign currencies are converted into united states dollars 
as a result  a decrease in the value of the mexican peso or canadian dollar could adversely affect our consolidated results of operations and equity 
shortages of fuel  increases in prices or rationing of petroleum products can have a materially adverse effect on our operations and profitability 
fuel is subject to economic  political and market factors that are outside of our control 
from time to time we will enter into derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and certain hedging activities 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activity  an amendment of sfas sfas and sfas require that all derivative instruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their respective fair values 
derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through earnings 
in accordance with sfas  we adjust our derivative instruments to fair value through earnings on a monthly basis 
as of june   we had of estimated fuel purchases hedged through august we have recognized approximately  and  of expense associated with derivative contracts for the years ended june  and  respectively 
a hypothetical movement in the price of fuel future quantities would have an impact on net income of approximately
