table of contents in july  we completed the purchase of specified assets and assumed specified liabilities related to the rehabilitation business  referred to herein as orthotech or the orthotech business  of depuy orthopaedic technology  inc  a subsidiary of johnson johnson 
we acquired orthotech for a purchase price of million in cash  exclusive of transaction fees and expenses 
orthotech developed  manufactured  and marketed an array of orthopedic products for the orthopedic sports medicine market  including braces  soft goods and specialty products which were similar to the products offered by us 
orthotech also had an inventory management and billing program that complemented our officecare program 
we purchased primarily inventory  equipment and certain intellectual property 
we were not required to assume any liabilities existing prior to the closing date 
the orthotech acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting whereby the total purchase price has been allocated to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair market values 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates including those related to contractual allowances  doubtful accounts  inventories  rebates  product returns  warranty obligations  income taxes  intangibles and investments 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations provision for contractual allowances and doubtful accounts 
we maintain provisions for i contractual allowances for reimbursement amounts from our third party payers based on negotiated contracts  and  ii for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we have contracts with third party payers for our third party reimbursement billings which call for specified reductions in reimbursement of billed amounts based upon contractual terms and or product reimbursement rates 
we reserve for and reduce gross revenues by between and for these contractual allowances 
our reserve for doubtful accounts is based upon estimated losses from customers who are billed directly and amounts disallowed by the third party payers  primarily for various reasons that we categorize as billing exceptions 
direct billed customers represent approximately of our net receivables at december  and we have historically experienced write offs of less than of these receivables 
our third party reimbursement customers represent of our net receivables at december  and we estimate bad debt expense to be approximately of amounts due from these third party reimbursement customers 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments or if third party payers were to deny claims for late filings  incomplete information or other reasons  additional provisions may be required 
as disclosed in our form k for the year ended december  and our form qs during  we experienced a problem with a third party insurance billing company  which required that a substantial portion of the accounts receivable from our officecare and insurance programs be transferred to another third party billing company in the latter half of we have provided additional reserves in prior periods for contractual allowances and doubtful accounts for third party reimbursement receivables which were originally billed through the third party insurance billing company whose contract was canceled in due to lack of timely and thorough filings with third party payers 
during the second quarter of  we enhanced the ability of our systems to obtain and analyze the information processed by our third party billing companies 
historically  we relied heavily on these billing companies to provide information about the officecare and insurance programs  including the data utilized to determine reserves for contractual allowances and doubtful accounts 
our increased ability to obtain and better analyze information in the second quarter of revealed that  as a result of historical third party billing problems  we had experienced an increase in write offs and bad debts for accounts receivable from our officecare and insurance programs 
in addition  in december we initiated the transition to a new third party insurance billing service provider and we continue to resolve issues related to our previous service providers and accounts receivable aged over one year 
accordingly  we increased our related reserves by an aggregate of million for the year ended december   which is included in sales and marketing expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for based on information currently available to us  we believe we have provided adequate reserves for our third party payor accounts receivable 
if claims are denied  or amounts are otherwise not paid  in excess of our estimates  the recoverability of the net accounts receivable could be reduced by a material amount 
in addition  if the transition to our new third party insurance billing service provider is not successful  we may be required to increase our reserve estimates 

table of contents reserve for excess and obsolete inventories 
we provide reserves for estimated excess or obsolete inventories equal to the difference between the cost of inventories on hand plus future purchase commitments and the estimated market value based upon an assumption about future demand 
if future demand is less favorable than currently projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
in addition  reserves for inventories on hand in our officecare locations are provided based on historical shrinkage rates 
if actual shrinkage rates differ from our estimated shrinkage rates  revisions to the reserve may be required 
we also provide reserves for newer product inventories  as appropriate  based on any minimum purchase commitments and the current status of any fda approval process  if required  and our level of sales of the new products 
in connection with our decision  as part of our performance improvement program  to discontinue marketing our alaron surgical products and our knee replacement product  we recorded provisions in to reserve all remaining net inventories related to these products 
we based our reserves for our knee replacement product on amounts we estimate will be recoverable from our supplier of the knee replacement product 
if our estimates of the recoverability of the knee replacement product differ from the actual amounts received  additional write downs may be required 
we have also provided reserves in for all remaining net inventories of our orthopulse product based on the inability of the manufacturer of orthopulse to make any material progress in in achieving fda approval for the product 
we also increased our estimates of reserves required for certain other excess inventories in aggregate inventory reserves recorded in in connection with these decisions were million  which is included within cost of goods sold in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for see note to our notes to the consolidated financial statements 
rebates 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer rebate programs based upon estimates of the costs applicable to the rebate programs 
returns and warranties 
we provide for the estimated cost of returns and product warranties at the time revenue is recognized based on historical trends 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our suppliers  our actual returns and warranty costs could differ from our estimates 
if actual product returns  failure rates  material usage or service costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated return and or warranty liabilities may be required 
valuation allowance for deferred tax asset 
as of december   the company had recorded approximately million of net deferred tax assets related primarily to tax deductible goodwill arising at the date of the reorganization and not recognized for book purposes and net losses reported during realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent on our ability to generate approximately million of future taxable income over the next years 
as discussed above  we expect that our performance improvement program will generate cost reductions and revenue growth of a sufficient level that management believes that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized based on forecasted future taxable income 
however  there can be no assurance that we will meet our expectations of future taxable income 
management will evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis to assess any need for valuation allowances 
in the event that the company is not profitable during  no tax benefit will be provided on the losses 
if we are in a loss position by the end of  it is possible that some or all of our deferred tax assets may need to be reserved through a valuation allowance 
goodwill and other intangibles 
at december   goodwill and other intangible assets were evaluated for impairment as required by sfas no 
we did not recognize any goodwill impairment as a result of performing this annual test 
the determination of the fair value of certain acquired assets and liabilities is subjective in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
determining the fair values and useful lives of intangible assets especially requires the exercise of judgement 
upon initially recording our goodwill and certain of our other intangible assets  we used an independent valuation firm 
subsequently  we have used the same methodology and updated our assumptions 
while there are a number of different generally accepted valuation methods to estimate the value of intangible assets acquired  we primarily used the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets 
this method requires significant management judgement to forecast the future operating results used in the analysis 
in addition  other significant estimates are required such as residual growth rates and discount factors 
the estimates we have used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business  based on available historical information and industry averages 
the impairment charge we recorded for certain long lived assets in was a result of certain new products not achieving anticipated revenues or estimated recovery values of assets being disposed of being less than anticipated 
the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets is exposed to future impairments if we experience further declines in operating results  if additional negative industry or economic trends occur or if our future performance is below our projections or estimates 
income statement reclassifications effective december   we have reclassified certain amounts within our consolidated statements of operations  including expenses related to the shipping and handling of our products to customers million

we have also made certain other less material reclassifications 
all statement of operations information included herein for the year ended december  has been presented in accordance with the new classifications and all historical information has been reclassified for a consistent presentation 
segments prior to the fourth quarter of  we had two reportable segments  as defined by fasb sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  identified as rigid knee bracing and soft goods 
effective december   we have changed our reporting segments to reflect segmentation by our primary distribution channels  which is consistent with how we will manage our business prospectively 
our new reportable segments are as follows donjoy  in which our products are sold by independent sales agents who employ over sales representatives to orthopedic surgeons  orthotic and prosthetic centers  hospitals and other sports medicine outlets 
after a product order is received by a sales representative  we generally ship the product directly to the orthopedic professional and we pay a sales commission to the agent based on sales of such products  which commissions are reflected in sales and marketing expense in our consolidated financial statements  procare  in which products are sold primarily to national third party distributors  regional medical supply dealers and medical product buying groups  generally at a discount from list prices 
these distributors then resell these products to large hospital chains  hospital buying groups  primary care networks and orthopedic physicians for use by the patients  officecare  in which we maintain an inventory of product on hand at orthopedic practices for immediate disbursement to the patient and we arrange billing to the patient or third party payor 
the majority of these billings are performed by an independent third party contractor 
the officecare program is also intended to facilitate the introduction of our products to orthopedic sports medicine surgeons who had not previously been our customers 
as of december   the officecare program was located at over physician offices throughout the united states 
sales through our officecare channel are subject to certain risks related to third party reimbursements 
see risk factors included in item herein  and international  in which our products are sold in foreign countries through wholly owned subsidiaries or independent distributors 
we market our products in over countries primarily in europe  the united kingdom  australia  canada and japan

international sales are currently made primarily through two distinct channels independent third party distributors  including smith nephew sales organizations in certain countries  and through wholly or majority owned foreign subsidiaries in australia since march  in germany and the united kingdom in each case since january  and in canada since may 
we had formed a majority owned distribution subsidiary in australia in  and that company was focusing on surgical products  including a knee replacement product 
in late we decided to discontinue commercial activities on that product  as well as our other surgical products  and in light of that decision  the establishment of a subsidiary in australia was no longer attractive 
at the end of  we sold our inventory of the knee replacement product back to the manufacturer and sold our interest in the australian subsidiary to the minority shareholder 
the former australian subsidiary will continue to sell our products as an independent distributor 
commencing with the formation of our wholly owned subsidiaries in  we sell products through our subsidiaries in germany  the united kingdom and canada in euros  pounds sterling and canadian dollars  respectively 
international sales in were favorably impacted by foreign currency exchange fluctuations with the weakening of the us dollar against the euro 
in  the volume of international sales was indirectly adversely impacted by foreign currency exchange fluctuations as the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro effectively increased the cost of our products to our european third party distributors 
as we begin to further directly distribute our products in other selected foreign countries  we expect that future sales of our products in these markets will be denominated in the applicable foreign currencies which would cause currency fluctuations to more directly impact our operating results 
we may seek to reduce the potential impact of currency fluctuations on our business through hedging transactions 
results of operations we operate our business on a manufacturing calendar  with our fiscal year always ending on december each quarter is weeks  consisting of one five week and two four week periods

as required by the fda  an independent review of the clinical data commenced on august  the auditor s report was submitted on september   and imd is engaged in ongoing communications with the fda to address this matter 
under the current arrangement  we expect to make a payment of million upon final fda approval and a million payment shortly afterwards for the us distribution rights 
however  the exact timing of payments is not determinable at this time 
we purchased million  million and million in inventory from imd in  and  respectively  and we made a million investment in imd which represents a ownership in the company in we cannot distribute such inventory in the united states until fda approval is obtained  and although we can distribute such inventory in certain other countries which do not require fda approval  the markets in these countries are smaller than in the us at this point  we do not have an estimate of when or whether final fda approval will occur  and we have  as a result of this continuing uncertainty  recorded charges to fully reserve our inventories of this product and we have written off our investment in imd

table of contents as part of our strategy  we may pursue acquisitions  investments and strategic alliances 
we may require new sources of financing to consummate any such transactions  including additional debt or equity financing 
we cannot assure you that such additional sources of financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition  we may not be able to consummate any such transactions due to the operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our bank credit facility and the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes 
our ability to satisfy our debt obligations and to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness  fund working capital requirements and make anticipated capital expenditures will depend on our future performance  which is subject to general economic  financial and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
management believes that based on current levels of operations and anticipated growth  cash flow from operations  together with other available sources of funds including the availability of borrowings under the revolving bank credit facility  will be adequate for at least the next twelve months to make required payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness  to fund anticipated capital expenditures and for working capital requirements 
there can be no assurance  however  that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowings will be available under the revolving bank credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to service our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 
in such event  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financings 
we cannot assure you that any such funds will be available to us on favorable terms or at all 
as of december   we had available a total of approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and million available under the revolving bank credit facility 
for  we expect to spend total cash of approximately million for the following requirements approximately million scheduled principal and interest payments on our bank credit facility and the senior subordinated notes  approximately million prepayment made on the march  to reduce the outstanding term loans under our bank credit facility  and up to million for capital expenditures 
in addition  we expect to make other general corporate payments in recent accounting pronouncements for information on the recent accounting pronouncements impacting our business  see note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations 
primary exposure includes changes in interest rates 
we are exposed to interest rate risk in connection with the term loans and borrowings under the revolving bank credit facility which bear interest at floating rates based on london inter bank offered rate libor or the prime rate plus an applicable borrowing margin 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact earnings or cash flows 
conversely  for variable rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
as of december   we had million principal amount of fixed rate debt represented by our senior subordinated notes and million of variable rate debt represented by borrowings under the bank credit facility at an interest rate of at december  
based on our current balance outstanding under the bank credit facility  an immediate change of one percentage point in the applicable interest rate would cause an increase or decrease in interest expense of approximately million on an annual basis 
at december   up to million of variable rate borrowings were available under the revolving bank credit facility 
we may use derivative financial instruments  where appropriate  to manage our interest rate risks 
however  as a matter of policy  we do not enter into derivative or other financial investments for trading or speculative purposes 
commencing january   we began selling products through our subsidiaries in germany and the united kingdom in euros and pounds sterling  respectively and  commencing may   we began selling products through our subsidiary in canada in canadian dollars 
international sales in were favorably impacted by foreign currency exchange fluctuations with the weakening of the us dollar against the euro 
in  the volume and product mix of international sales was indirectly adversely impacted by foreign currency exchange fluctuations as the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro effectively increased the cost of our products to our european third party distributors 
as we begin to further directly distribute our products in other selected foreign countries  we expect that future sales of our products in these markets will be denominated in the applicable foreign currencies which would cause currency 
table of contents fluctuations to more directly impact our operating results 
we may seek to reduce the potential impact of currency fluctuations on our business through hedging transactions 
our distribution and purchase agreement with imd has provisions tied to the fluctuation of the euro 
in the event the value of the euro in us dollars on the date of payment of a million licensing fee to be paid by us after final fda approval of orthopulse is obtained changes from a specified rate  imd reserves the right to adjust pricing on future products purchased by us from imd to reflect the exchange rate in effect at that time 
we may mitigate these risks by entering into hedging transactions
