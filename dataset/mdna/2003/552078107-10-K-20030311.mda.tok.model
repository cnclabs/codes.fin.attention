item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations environmental matters 
the following table outlines the intermediate chemicals and derivatives business segment s primary products  annual processing capacities as of january   and the primary uses for such products 
unless otherwise specified  annual processing capacities were calculated by estimating the number of days in a typical year that a production unit of a plant is expected to operate  after allowing downtime for regular maintenance  and multiplying that number by an amount equal to the unit s optimal daily output based on the design raw material mix 
because the processing capacity of a production unit is an estimated amount  actual production volumes may be more or less than capacities set forth below 
capacities shown include of the capacity of joint venture facilities

raw materials the principal hydrocarbon raw materials purchased by the intermediate chemicals and derivatives business segment are propylene  butane  ethylene  benzene and methanol 
the market prices of these raw materials historically have been related to the price of crude oil and its principal refinery derivatives  natural gas liquids  and natural gas 
these materials are received in bulk quantities via pipeline or marine vessels 
generally  the segment s 
table of contents raw materials requirements are purchased at market based prices from numerous suppliers in the united states and europe with which the company has established contractual relationships  as well as in the spot market 
the company s raw material suppliers include equistar  which is a leading producer of propylene  ethylene and benzene and is expected to be the major supplier of these raw materials to lyondell s us business in see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in december  the company entered into an agreement with methanex corporation methanex for methanex to become the exclusive supplier of the company s worldwide methanol raw material requirements 
the agreement provides cost based supplies of methanol and will be phased in over time beginning in and extending through methanex has an option to extend the agreement for an additional three year period 
the intermediate chemicals and derivatives business segment is a large volume consumer of isobutane for chemical production 
the company has invested in facilities  or entered into processing agreements with unrelated third parties  to convert the widely available commodity  normal butane  to isobutane 
the segment is also a large consumer of oxygen for its po tba plants at bayport  texas  botlek rotterdam  the netherlands  and fos sur mer  france 
the cost of raw materials generally is the largest component of total production cost for the intermediate chemicals and derivatives business 
the segment s raw materials are  in general  commodity chemicals with numerous bulk suppliers and ready availability at competitive prices 
historically  raw material availability has not been an issue for the intermediate chemicals and derivatives business segment 
however  in order to enhance reliability and competitiveness of prices and rates for supplies of raw materials  industrial gas and other utilities  the company is a party to long term agreements and other arrangements with suppliers  including equistar  for a substantial portion of its production requirements 
for additional discussion regarding the effects of raw material pricing on recent operating performance  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
marketing and sales in  most of the segment s revenues were derived from sales to  or processing agreements with  unrelated parties 
in  no single customer accounted for or more of lyondell s total revenues 
the intermediate chemicals and derivatives business segment delivers products through sales agreements  processing agreements and spot sales as well as product exchanges 
production levels at lyondell s po sm and po tba co product production facilities are determined by the demand for po and po derivatives 
the resulting production levels of co products sm and mtbe thus depend primarily on the demand for po and po derivatives and secondarily on the relative market demand for sm and mtbe and the operational flexibility of lyondell s multiple production facilities in meeting this demand 
lyondell purchases sm and mtbe for resale  when necessary  to satisfy customer demand for these co products above co product production levels 
lyondell has also purchased sm for resale to satisfy its customer requirements prior to start up of its new po sm plant in the netherlands 
volumes of sm and mtbe purchases made for resale can vary significantly from period to period 
however  purchased volumes have not historically had a significant impact on profitability 
the segment has a number of multi year po processing or tolling and sales agreements 
this reflects an effort to mitigate the adverse impact of competitive factors and economic business cycles on demand for the segment s po 
in addition  bayer s ownership interest in the po joint venture represents ownership of an in kind portion of the po production of the po joint venture 
see joint ventures and other agreements 
the majority of the segment s po derivatives are sold through market based sales contracts under annual or multi year arrangements 

table of contents lyondell sells most of its sm production into the north american merchant market and to export markets through long term sales contracts and processing agreements 
see joint ventures and other agreements 
during and prior years  the company sold mtbe pursuant to a take or pay mtbe sales contract with atlantic richfield company arco  now wholly owned by bp plc bp 
sales pursuant to this contract represented approximately of lyondell s worldwide mtbe sales volumes 
the contract provided for formula based prices  which have been significantly higher than market prices  and expired december  in addition  during and prior years  the company also sold its mtbe production under market based sales agreements  including multi year agreements  and in the spot market 
the company anticipates that the mtbe production previously sold under the expired mtbe sales contract with bp referenced above will be sold under market based annual sales contracts and in the spot market

equistar petrochemicals overview petrochemicals are fundamental to many segments of the economy  including the production of consumer products  housing and automotive components and other durable and nondurable goods 
equistar produces a variety of petrochemicals  including olefins  oxygenated products  aromatics and specialty products  at eleven facilities located in five states 
olefins include ethylene  propylene and butadiene 
oxygenated products include eo and derivatives  eg  ethanol  and mtbe 
aromatics produced are benzene and toluene 
equistar s petrochemical products are used to manufacture polymers and intermediate chemicals  which are used in a variety of consumer and industrial products 
ethylene is the most significant petrochemical in terms of worldwide production volume and is the key building block for polyethylene and a large number of other chemicals  plastics and synthetics 

table of contents the chocolate bayou  corpus christi and two channelview  texas olefins plants use petroleum liquids  including naphtha  condensates and gas oils  to produce ethylene 
the use of petroleum liquids results in the production of a significant amount of co products such as propylene  butadiene  benzene and toluene  and specialty products  such as dicyclopentadiene dcpd  isoprene  resin oil and piperylenes 
based upon independent third party surveys  management believes that its channelview facility is one of the lowest cash production cost olefins facilities in the united states 
equistar s morris  illinois  clinton  iowa  lake charles  louisiana  and laporte  texas plants are designed to consume primarily natural gas liquids  including ethane  propane and butane collectively ngls  to produce ethylene with some co products such as propylene 
the corpus christi and channelview plants also may consume ngl s to produce ethylene  depending upon the relative economic advantage of the alternative raw materials 
a comprehensive pipeline system connects the gulf coast plants with major olefins customers 
raw materials are sourced both internationally and domestically and are shipped via vessel and pipeline 
equistar s lake charles  louisiana facility has been idled since the first quarter of olefins accounted for approximately of equistar s total revenues in  in and in equistar produces eo and its primary derivative  eg  at facilities located in bayport pasadena  texas and through a joint venture with dupont in beaumont  texas 
the bayport facility also produces other derivatives of eo  principally ethers and ethanolamines 
eg is used in antifreeze  polyester fibers  resins and films 
eo and its derivatives are used in many consumer and industrial end uses  such as detergents and surfactants  brake fluids and polyurethane seating and bedding foams 
equistar produces synthetic ethanol at its tuscola  illinois plant by a direct hydration process that combines water and ethylene 
equistar also owns and operates a facility in newark  new jersey for denaturing ethanol by the addition of certain chemicals 
in addition  it produces small volumes of diethyl ether  a by product of its ethanol production  at its tuscola facility 
these ethanol products are ingredients in various consumer and industrial products as described more fully in the table below 
in march  equistar permanently shut down its anaheim  california ethanol denaturing facility 
the following table outlines equistar s primary petrochemical products  annual processing capacity as of january   and the primary uses for such products 
unless otherwise specified  annual processing capacity was calculated by estimating the number of days in a typical year that a production unit of a plant is expected to operate  after allowing for downtime for regular maintenance  and multiplying that number by an amount equal to the unit s optimal daily output based on the design raw material mix 
because the processing capacity of a production unit is an estimated amount  actual production volumes may be more or less than the capacities set forth below

table of contents raw materials the raw materials cost for olefins production is the largest component of total cost for the petrochemicals business 
olefins plants with the flexibility to consume a wide range of raw materials historically have had lower variable costs than olefins plants that are restricted in their raw material processing capability to ngls 
the primary raw materials used in the production of olefins are petroleum liquids also referred to as heavy raw materials and ngls also referred to as light raw materials 
petroleum liquids generally are delivered by ship or barge 
ngls are delivered to equistar s facilities primarily via pipeline 
petroleum liquids have had a historical cost advantage over ngls such as ethane and propane  assuming the co products were recovered and sold 
for example  facilities using petroleum liquids historically have generated approximately four cents additional variable margin on average per pound of ethylene produced compared to using ethane 
this margin advantage is based on an average of historical data over a period of years and is subject to short term fluctuations  which can be significant 
during the second half of and in  the advantage has been significantly less than the historical average 
equistar has the capability to realize this margin advantage due to its ability to process petroleum liquids at the channelview  corpus christi and chocolate bayou  texas facilities 
the channelview facility is particularly flexible because it can process petroleum liquids or up to ngls 
the corpus christi plant can process up to petroleum liquids or up to ngls 
the chocolate bayou facility processes petroleum liquids 
equistar s laporte facility can process natural gasoline and ngls  including heavier ngls such as butane 
equistar s three other olefins facilities currently process only ngls 
as described above  equistar believes that its raw material flexibility is a key advantage in the production of olefins 
as a result  although the majority of equistar s petroleum liquids requirements are purchased via contractual arrangements from a variety of domestic and international sources  equistar also purchases petroleum liquids on the spot market from domestic and international sources in order to maintain its raw material flexibility and to take advantage of raw material pricing opportunities 
similarly  equistar purchases a majority of its ngls requirements via contractual arrangements from a variety of sources  but also purchases ngls on the spot market 
equistar also obtains a portion of its petroleum liquids requirements from lcr at market related prices 
equistar purchases all of its methanol requirements from lyondell and its subsidiaries at a mix of cost based and market based prices 
also  equistar purchases large amounts of natural gas to be used as energy for consumption in its business via market based contractual arrangements with a variety of sources 
equistar s raw materials are  in general  commodity chemicals with numerous bulk suppliers and ready availability at competitive prices 
historically  raw material availability has not been an issue for equistar s petrochemicals business segment 
for additional discussion regarding the effects of raw material pricing on recent operating performance  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
marketing and sales ethylene produced by the clinton and morris facilities generally is consumed as a raw material by the polymers operations at those sites  or is transferred to tuscola from morris by pipeline for the production of ethanol 
ethylene produced by equistar s laporte facility is consumed as a raw material by equistar s polymers operations and millennium s vinyl acetate operations in laporte and also is distributed by pipeline for other internal uses and to third parties 
ethylene and propylene produced at the channelview  chocolate bayou  corpus christi and lake charles olefins plants are generally distributed by pipeline or via exchange agreements to equistar s gulf coast polymer and eo and eg facilities as well as to equistar s affiliates and third parties 
equistar s lake charles facility has been idled since the first quarter of for the year ended december   approximately of equistar s ethylene production  based on sales dollars  was consumed by equistar s polymers or oxygenated products businesses or sold to equistar s owners and their affiliates at market related prices 
with respect to sales to unaffiliated parties  equistar sells a majority of its olefins products to customers with whom it has had long standing relationships 
these sales generally are made under written agreements that typically provide for monthly negotiation of price  customer purchases of a specified minimum quantity  and three to six year terms with automatic one or two year term extension provisions 
some contracts may be terminated early if 
table of contents deliveries have been suspended for several months 
no single customer accounted for or more of equistar s total revenues in eo and eg typically are sold under three to five year contracts  with monthly pricing based on current market conditions 
lyondell provides sales services for equistar outside of north america for eo derivatives 
glycol ethers are sold primarily into the solvent and distributor markets at current market prices  as are ethanolamines and brake fluids 
ethanol and ethers primarily are sold under one year contracts at market prices 
equistar licenses mtbe technology under a license from a subsidiary of lyondell and sells a significant portion of mtbe produced at one of its two channelview units to lyondell at market related prices 
the production from the second unit is processed by equistar and returned to lcr for gasoline blending 
mtbe produced at chocolate bayou is sold at market related prices to lyondell for resale 
equistar sells most of its aromatics production under contracts that have initial terms ranging from one to three years and that typically contain automatic one year term extension provisions 
these contracts generally provide for monthly price adjustments based upon current market prices 
benzene produced by lcr is sold directly to equistar at market related prices 
equistar currently serves as lcr s sole agent to market toluene produced by lcr 
equistar at times purchases ethylene  propylene  benzene and butadiene for resale  when necessary  to satisfy customer demand for these products above production levels 
volumes of ethylene  propylene  benzene and butadiene purchases made for resale can vary significantly from period to period 
however  purchased volumes do not have a significant impact on profitability 
most of the ethylene and propylene production of the channelview  chocolate bayou  corpus christi and lake charles facilities is shipped via a  mile pipeline system which has connections to numerous gulf coast ethylene and propylene consumers 
this pipeline system  some of which is owned and some of which is leased by equistar  extends from corpus christi to mont belvieu to port arthur  texas as well as around the lake charles  louisiana area 
in addition  exchange agreements with other olefins producers allow access to customers who are not directly connected to equistar s pipeline system 
some ethylene is shipped by railcar from clinton  iowa to morris  illinois 
a pipeline owned and operated by a third party is used to transport ethylene from morris  illinois to tuscola  illinois 
some propylene is shipped by ocean going vessel 
ethylene oxide is shipped by railcar  and its derivatives are shipped by railcar  truck  isotank or ocean going vessel 
butadiene  aromatics and other petrochemicals are distributed by pipeline  railcar  truck  barge or ocean going vessel 
competition and industry conditions the bases for competition in equistar s petrochemicals products are price  product quality  product deliverability and customer service 
equistar competes with other large domestic producers of petrochemicals  including bp  chevron phillips  dow  exxon mobil corporation exxonmobil  huntsman chemical company  nova chemicals corporation nova chemicals and shell 
industry consolidation  including the combinations of british petroleum and amoco  exxon and mobil  and dow and union carbide corporation and the formation of chevron phillips  has brought north american production capacity under control of fewer  although larger and stronger  competitors 
equistar s combined rated ethylene capacity at january  was approximately billion pounds of ethylene per year  or approximately of total north american production capacity 
based on published rated production capacities  equistar believes it is currently the second largest producer of ethylene in north america 
north american ethylene rated capacity at january  was approximately billion pounds per year 
approximately of the total ethylene production capacity in north america is located along the gulf coast 
petrochemicals profitability is affected by raw materials costs and the level of demand for petrochemicals and derivatives  along with vigorous price competition among producers which may intensify due to  among other things  the addition of new capacity 
ethylene markets continue to be affected by excess capacity as a result of recent capacity additions  which have not yet been absorbed by demand growth 
in general  demand is a function of economic growth in the united states and elsewhere in the world  which fluctuates 
it is not possible to predict accurately the changes in raw material costs  market conditions and other factors that will affect petrochemical 
table of contents industry margins in the future 
the petrochemicals industry historically has experienced significant volatility in profitability due to fluctuations in capacity utilization 
equistar s other major commodity chemical products also experience cyclical market conditions similar to  although not necessarily coincident with  those of olefins 
equistar polymers overview through facilities located at nine plant sites in four states  equistar s polymers segment manufactures a wide variety of polyolefins  including polyethylene  polypropylene and various performance polymers 
polyolefins are used in a variety of consumer and industrial products  including packaging film  trash bags  automotive parts  plastic bottles and caps and compounds for wire and cable insulation 
equistar currently manufactures polyethylene using a variety of technologies at five facilities in texas and at its morris  illinois and clinton  iowa facilities 
the morris and clinton facilities enjoy a freight cost advantage over gulf coast producers in delivering products to customers in the us midwest and on the east coast of the united states 
polyethylene accounted for approximately of equistar s total revenues in  in and in equistar produces performance polymer products  which include enhanced grades of polyethylene and polypropylene  at several of its polymers facilities 
the company believes that  over a business cycle  average selling prices and profit margins for performance polymers tend to be higher than average selling prices and profit margins for higher volume commodity polyethylenes 
equistar also produces wire and cable insulating resins and compounds at laporte  texas  and morris  illinois  and wire and cable insulating compounds at fairport harbor  ohio  and tuscola  illinois 
wire and cable insulating resins and compounds are used to insulate copper and fiber optic wiring in power  telecommunication  computer and automobile applications 
in august  equistar permanently shut down its peachtree city  georgia wire and cable insulating compounds facility 
equistar s morris  illinois and bayport pasadena  texas facilities manufacture polypropylene using propylene produced as a co product of equistar s ethylene production as well as propylene purchased from unaffiliated parties 
polypropylene is sold for various applications in the automotive  housewares and appliance industries 
the following table outlines equistar s polymers and performance polymers products  annual processing capacity at january   and the primary uses for such products 
unless otherwise specified  annual processing capacity was calculated by estimating the number of days in a typical year that a production unit of a plant is expected to operate  after allowing for downtime for regular maintenance  and multiplying that number by an amount equal to the unit s optimal daily output based on the design raw material mix 
because the processing capacity of a production unit is an estimated amount  actual production volumes may be more or less than the capacities set forth below 
capacities shown represent of the capacity of equistar  of which lyondell owns

a these are enhanced grades of polyethylene and are included in the capacity figures for hdpe  ldpe and lldpe above  as appropriate 
raw materials the primary raw materials for equistar s polymers segment are ethylene and propylene 
with the exception of the chocolate bayou polyethylene plant  equistar s polyethylene and polypropylene production facilities can receive their ethylene and propylene directly from equistar s petrochemical facilities via equistar s olefins pipeline system  by third party pipelines or from on site production 
most of the raw materials consumed by equistar s polymers 
table of contents segment are produced internally by equistar s petrochemicals segment 
the polyethylene plants at chocolate bayou  laporte and bayport  texas are connected by pipeline to third parties and can receive ethylene via exchanges or purchases 
the polypropylene facility at morris  illinois also receives propylene from third parties 
equistar s raw materials are  in general  commodity chemicals with numerous bulk suppliers and ready availability at competitive prices 
historically  raw material availability has not been an issue for equistar s polymers business segment 
for additional discussion regarding the effects of raw material pricing on recent operating results  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
marketing and sales equistar s polymers products are primarily sold to an extensive base of established customers 
approximately of equistar s polymers products volumes are sold to customers under term contracts  typically having a duration of one to three years 
the remainder generally is sold without contractual term commitments 
in either case  in most of the continuous supply relationships  prices are subject to change upon mutual agreement between equistar and the customer 
no single customer accounted for or more of equistar s total revenues in polymers are primarily distributed via railcar 
equistar owns or leases  pursuant to long term lease arrangements  approximately  railcars for use in its polymers business 
equistar sells the vast majority of its polymers products in the united states and canada  and such sales primarily are through its own sales organization 
it generally engages sales agents to market its polymers in the rest of the world 
competition and industry conditions the bases for competition in equistar s polymers products are price  product performance  product quality  product deliverability and customer service 
equistar competes with other large producers of polymers  including bp solvay polyethylene  chevron phillips  dow  eastman chemical company  exxonmobil  formosa plastics  huntsman chemical company  nova chemicals  totalfinaelf and westlake polymers 
industry consolidation  including the combinations of british petroleum and amoco  exxon and mobil  and dow and union carbide corporation  the formation of chevron phillips  and the polymers business combinations between bp and solvay  has brought north american production capacity under control of fewer  although larger and stronger  competitors 
based on published rated industry capacities  equistar is the third largest producer of polyethylene in north america 
equistar also believes that it is a leading domestic producer of polyolefins powders  wire and cable insulating resins and compounds  and polymers for adhesives 
the combined rated capacity of equistar s polyethylene units as of january  was approximately billion pounds per year  or approximately of total industry capacity in north america 
there are other north american producers of polyethylene  including bp solvay polyethylene  chevron phillips  dow  exxonmobil and nova chemicals 
equistar s polypropylene capacity  million pounds per year as of january   represents approximately of the total north american polypropylene capacity 
there are other north american competitors in the polypropylene business  including atofina  basell polyolefins company nv  bp  dow  exxonmobil and sunoco  inc polymers profitability is affected by raw material costs and the worldwide level of demand for polymers  along with vigorous price competition among producers which may intensify due to  among other things  the addition of new capacity 
in general  demand is a function of economic growth in the united states and elsewhere in the world  which fluctuates 
it is not possible to predict accurately the changes in raw material costs  market conditions and other factors which will affect polymers industry margins in the future

table of contents lyondell citgo refining lp overview lyondell participates in petroleum refining through an equity interest in lcr 
lyondell holds a interest and citgo holds a interest in lcr 
lcr owns and operates a refinery the refinery  which is located on the houston ship channel in houston  texas 
lcr was formed in to upgrade the refinery s ability to process substantial additional volumes of lower cost  extra heavy  higher margin crude oil 
as of january   the refinery s extra heavy crude oil processing capacity was approximately  barrels per day 
the refinery is a full conversion refinery designed to run extra heavy degree api  high sulfur crude oil 
the degree api gravity crude oil is more viscous and dense than traditional crude oil and contains higher concentrations of sulfur and heavy metals  making it more difficult to refine into gasoline and other high value fuel products but less costly to purchase 
processing extra heavy  high sulfur crude oil in significant quantities requires a refinery with extensive coking  catalytic cracking  hydrotreating and desulfurization capabilities  ie  a complex refinery 
the refinery s complexity enables it to operate in full conversion mode producing a slate of products that consists primarily of high value  clean products many refineries produce significant quantities of lower value products such as conventional gasoline  high sulfur diesel and heavy fuel oil due to a lack of equipment to convert these fuels into premium products 
in addition  the refinery s complexity allows it to produce most of these clean products as premium grades such as reformulated gasoline  jet fuel  low sulfur diesel and aromatics chemicals 
the refinery s products include conventional and reformulated gasoline  low sulfur diesel  jet fuel  aromatics  lubricants industrial lubricants  white oils and process oils  carbon black oil  sulfur  residual fuel and petroleum coke 
gasoline accounted for approximately of lcr s total revenues in  in and in diesel accounted for approximately of lcr s total revenues in  in and in the aromatics chemicals produced by the refinery are benzene  toluene  orthoxylene and paraxylene 
these products are sold to manufacturers of intermediate chemicals and polyester intermediates and are ultimately used in clothing  soft drink bottles and drinking cups  audio and video tapes  and resins 
the following table outlines lcr s primary products  annual rated capacity as of january   and the primary uses for such products 
the term rated capacity  as used in this table  is calculated by estimating the number of days in a typical year that a production unit of a plant is expected to operate  after allowing for downtime for regular maintenance  and multiplying that number by an amount equal to the unit s optimal daily output based on the design feedstock mix 
because the rated capacity of a production unit is an estimated amount  the actual production volumes may be more or less than the rated capacity 
capacities shown represent of the capacity of lcr  of which lyondell owns 
product rated capacity primary uses gasoline a  barrels per day automotive fuel diesel distillate a  barrels per day fuel for diesel cars and trucks jet fuel a  barrels per day aviation fuel benzene b million gallons per year nylon for clothing and consumer items  polystyrene for insulation  packaging and drink cups toluene c million gallons per year gasoline component and chemical feedstock for producing benzene paraxylene d million pounds per year polyester fibers for clothing and fabrics  pet soft drink bottles and films for audio and video tapes orthoxylene d million pounds per year plasticizer in products such as rainwear  shower curtains  toys and auto upholstery and an intermediate in paints and fiberglass lube oils a  barrels per day automotive and industrial engine and lube oils  railroad engine additives and white oils for food grade applications a produced by lcr and sold to citgo 
b produced by lcr and sold to equistar 
c produced by lcr and marketed for lcr by equistar 
d produced by lcr and marketed for lcr by citgo 

table of contents management of lcr lcr is a limited partnership organized under the laws of the state of delaware 
lyondell owns its interest in lcr through wholly owned subsidiaries  which serve as general partner and limited partner 
similarly  citgo  which is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of petr leos de venezuela  sa pdvsa  the national oil company of the republic of venezuela  owns its interest in lcr through wholly owned subsidiaries  which serve as general partner and limited partner 
lcr is governed by a limited partnership agreement the lcr partnership agreement  which provides for  among other things  the ownership and cash distribution rights of the partners 
the lcr partnership agreement also provides that lcr is managed by a partnership governance committee  which is composed of six representatives  three appointed by each general partner 
actions requiring unanimous consent of the representatives include amendment of the lcr partnership agreement  borrowing money  delegations of authority to committees  certain purchase commitments and capital expenditures 
the day to day operations of the refinery are managed by two general managers  one of which is a loaned employee of lyondell and the other of which is a loaned employee of citgo 
agreements between lyondell or citgo and lcr lcr is a party to a number of agreements with lyondell and citgo 
under the terms of a long term product sales agreement products agreement  citgo purchases from lcr substantially all of the refined products produced at the refinery 
lyondell and citgo currently perform administrative services for lcr pursuant to an administrative services agreement  which is renegotiated annually 
under the terms of lubricant sales agreements  citgo purchases all of the lubricant products manufactured by lcr 
in conjunction therewith  citgo operates lcr s birmingport  alabama lubricants plant 
in addition  citgo currently serves as lcr s sole agent to market paraxylene and orthoxylene produced by lcr 
agreements between equistar and lcr prior to the formation of equistar  lyondell was a party with lcr to multiple agreements designed to preserve many of the synergies between the refinery and the channelview petrochemicals facility 
these agreements were assumed by equistar from lyondell effective december  economic evaluations at the channelview facility and the refinery are made to maximize product utilization  which may be local use  use at the other site  or third party sales 
certain refinery products propane  butane  low octane naphthas  heating oils  and gas oils can be used as raw materials for olefins production  and certain channelview facility olefins by products can be processed by the refinery into gasoline 
butylenes from the refinery are processed by the channelview facility and returned to lcr for the production of alkylate and mtbe for gasoline blending 
hydrogen from the channelview facility is used at the refinery for sulfur removal and product stabilization 
benzene produced by lcr is sold directly to equistar at market related prices 
in addition  equistar currently serves as lcr s sole agent to market toluene produced by lcr 
see note and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
raw materials in  lcr entered into a long term crude supply agreement crude supply agreement with lagoven  sa  now known as pdvsa petr leo  sa pdvsa oil  an affiliate of citgo and of pdvsa 
most of the crude oil used by lcr as a raw material for the refinery is purchased under the crude supply agreement 
both pdvsa oil and citgo are direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries of pdvsa 
the crude supply agreement  which expires on december   incorporates formula prices to be paid by lcr for the crude oil supplied based on the market value of a slate of refined products deemed to be produced from each particular crude oil or feedstock  less certain deemed refining costs  adjustable for inflation and energy costs  certain actual costs  and a deemed margin  which varies according to the grade of crude oil or other feedstock delivered 
the actual refining margin earned by lcr may vary from the formula amount depending on  among other things  timing differences in incorporating changes in refined product market values and energy costs into the crude supply agreement s deemed margin calculations and the efficiency with which lcr conducts its operations 
although lcr believes that the crude supply agreement reduces the volatility of lcr s earnings and 
table of contents cash flows over the long term  the crude supply agreement also limits lcr s ability to enjoy higher margins during periods when the market price of crude oil is low relative to then current market prices for refined products 
in addition  if the actual yields  costs or volumes of the lcr refinery differ substantially from those contemplated by the crude supply agreement  the benefits of this agreement to lcr could be substantially diminished  and could result in lower earnings and cash flow for lcr 
furthermore  there may be periods during which lcr s costs for crude oil under the crude supply agreement may be higher than might otherwise be available to lcr from other sources 
a disparate increase in the price of heavy crude oil relative to the prices for its products has the tendency to make continued performance of its obligations under the crude supply agreement less attractive to pdvsa oil 
the crude supply agreement provides that lyondell controls all of lcr s decisions and enforcement rights in connection with the crude supply agreement so long as pdvsa has a direct or indirect ownership interest in lcr 
however  there are risks associated with enforcing the provisions of contracts with companies such as pdvsa oil that are non united states affiliates of a sovereign nation 
all of the crude oil supplied by pdvsa oil under the crude supply agreement is produced in the republic of venezuela  which has experienced economic difficulties and attendant social and political changes and unrest in recent years  including during the recent national strike 
it is impossible to predict how governmental policies may change under the current or any subsequent venezuelan government 
in addition  there are risks associated with enforcing judgments of united states courts against entities whose assets are located outside of the united states and whose management does not reside in the united states 
although the parties have negotiated alternative arrangements in the event of certain force majeure conditions  including venezuelan governmental or other actions restricting or otherwise limiting pdvsa oil s ability to perform its obligations  any such alternative arrangements may not be as beneficial to lcr as the crude supply agreement 
from time to time  the company and pdvsa have had discussions covering both a restructuring of the crude supply agreement and a broader restructuring of the lcr partnership 
the company is unable to predict whether changes in either arrangement will occur 
if the crude supply agreement is modified or terminated or this source of crude oil is otherwise interrupted  due to production difficulties  political or economic events in venezuela or other factors  lcr could experience significantly lower earnings and cash flows 
subject to the consent of the other partner and rights of first offer and first refusal  the partners each have a right to transfer their interests in lcr to unaffiliated third parties in certain circumstances 
in the event that citgo were to transfer its interest in lcr to an unaffiliated third party  pdvsa oil would have an option to terminate the crude supply agreement 
depending on then current market conditions  any breach or termination of the crude supply agreement  or reduction in supply thereunder  would require lcr to purchase all or a portion of its crude oil in the merchant market  could subject lcr to significant volatility and price fluctuations and could adversely affect lcr and  therefore  lyondell 
there can be no assurance that alternative crude oil supplies with similar margins would be available for purchase by lcr 
under the crude supply agreement  pdvsa oil is required to sell  and lcr is required to purchase   barrels per day of extra heavy crude oil  which constitutes approximately of the refinery s refining capacity of  barrels per day of crude oil 
since april  pdvsa oil has  from time to time  declared itself in a force majeure situation and subsequently reduced deliveries of crude oil 
such reductions in deliveries were purportedly based on announced opec production cuts 
pdvsa oil informed lcr that the venezuelan government  through the ministry of energy and mines  had instructed that production of certain grades of crude oil be reduced 
in certain circumstances  pdvsa oil made payments under a different provision of the crude supply agreement in partial compensation for such reductions 
in january  pdvsa oil again declared itself in a force majeure situation and stated that crude oil deliveries could be reduced by up to beginning march  beginning in march  deliveries of crude oil to lcr were reduced to approximately  barrels per day  reaching a level of  barrels per day during the second quarter crude oil deliveries to lcr under the crude supply agreement increased to the contract level of  barrels per day during the third quarter  averaging  barrels per day for the third quarter 
although deliveries increased to contract levels during the third quarter  pdvsa oil did not revoke its january force majeure declaration during a national strike in venezuela began in early december and disrupted deliveries of crude oil to lcr under the crude supply agreement  causing lcr to temporarily reduce operating rates 
pdvsa oil again declared a force majeure and reduced deliveries of crude oil to lcr 
lcr compensated for the loss in supply by reducing its 
table of contents inventories of crude supply agreement crude oil and increasing purchases of crude oil in the merchant market 
recent media reports indicate that the force majeure has been lifted 
for additional discussion regarding the effects of the recent political unrest in venezuela on operating performance  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
lcr has consistently contested the validity of pdvsa oil s and pdvsa s reductions in deliveries under the crude supply agreement 
the parties have different interpretations of the provisions of the contracts concerning the delivery of crude oil 
the contracts do not contain dispute resolution procedures  and the parties have been unable to resolve their commercial dispute 
as a result  on february   lcr filed a lawsuit against pdvsa and pdvsa oil in connection with the force majeure declarations 
see item legal proceedings litigation matters 
marketing and sales the refinery produces gasoline  low sulfur diesel  jet fuel  aromatics  lubricants and certain industrial products 
on a weekly basis  lcr evaluates and determines the optimal product output mix for the refinery  based on spot market prices and conditions 
under the products agreement  citgo is obligated to purchase and lcr is required to sell of the finished gasoline  jet fuel  heating oil  diesel fuel  coke and sulfur produced by the refinery 
citgo purchases these products at prices based on industry benchmark indexes 
for example  the price for gasoline is based on prices published by platts oilgram  an industry trade publication 
the products agreement provides that lyondell controls all of lcr s material decisions and enforcement rights in connection with the products agreement so long as citgo has a direct or indirect ownership interest in lcr 
the products agreement expires on december  competition and industry conditions all of lcr s finished gasoline  jet fuel  heating oil  diesel fuel  coke  sulfur and lube oils are sold to citgo at market related prices 
the refining business tends to be volatile as well as cyclical 
however  management believes that the combination of the crude supply agreement and the products agreement generally has the effect of stabilizing earnings and cash flows and reducing the market driven aspects of such volatility over the long term 
crude oil prices  which are impacted by worldwide political events and the economics of exploration and production in addition to refined products demand  are the largest source of this volatility 
demand for refined products is influenced by seasonal and short term factors such as weather and driving patterns  as well as by longer term issues such as the economy  energy conservation and alternative fuels 
industry refined products supply is also dependent on industry operating capabilities and on long term refining capacity trends 
with a capacity of approximately  barrels per day  the company believes that the refinery is north america s largest full conversion ie  not producing asphalt or high sulfur heavy fuel refinery capable of processing api crude oil 
among lcr s refining competitors are major integrated oil companies and domestic refiners that are owned by or affiliated with major integrated oil companies 
based on published industry data  as of january   there were crude oil refineries in operation in the united states  and total domestic refinery capacity was approximately million barrels per day 
during  lcr processed an average of  barrels per day of crude oil or approximately of all us crude runs

certain factors that may affect lyondell and its joint ventures there are many factors that may affect the businesses and results of operations of lyondell and its joint ventures 
some of these factors are discussed below 
for additional discussion regarding factors that may affect the businesses and operating results of lyondell and its joint ventures  see items and business and properties  forward looking statements  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and item a 
disclosure of market and regulatory risk 
industry cyclicality and overcapacity the historical operating results of lyondell and its joint ventures reflect the cyclical and volatile nature of the supply demand balance in both the chemical and refining industries 
these industries historically have experienced alternating periods of inadequate capacity and tight supply  causing prices and profit margins to increase  followed by periods when substantial capacity is added  resulting in oversupply  declining capacity utilization rates and declining prices and profit margins 
the cyclicality of these industries results in volatile profits and cash flow over the business cycle 
currently  there is overcapacity in the chemical industry  as a number of participants in the chemical industry have added capacity 
there can be no assurance that future growth in product demand will be sufficient to utilize this additional  or even current  capacity 
excess industry capacity has depressed and may continue to depress lyondell s and its joint ventures volumes and margins 
the global economic and political environment continues to be uncertain  contributing to low industry operating rates  adding to the volatility of raw material and energy costs  and forestalling the industry s recovery from trough conditions  all of which is placing  and may continue to place  pressure on lyondell s and its joint ventures results of operations 
raw materials and energy costs lyondell and its joint ventures purchase large amounts of raw materials and energy for their businesses 
the cost of these raw materials and energy  in the aggregate  represents a substantial portion of lyondell s and its joint ventures operating expenses 
the prices of raw materials and energy generally follow price trends of  and vary with the market conditions for  crude oil and natural gas  which may be highly volatile and cyclical 
results of operations for lyondell and its joint ventures have been and could be in the future significantly affected by increases in these costs 
in addition  higher natural gas prices adversely affect the ability of many domestic chemicals producers to compete internationally since us producers are disproportionately reliant on natural gas and natural gas liquids as an energy source and as a raw material 
in addition to the impact that this has had on equistar s exports  reduced competitiveness of us producers also has in the past increased the availability of chemicals in north america  as us production that would otherwise have been sold overseas was instead offered for sale domestically  resulting in excess supply and lower prices in north america 
general economic conditions and other external factors external factors beyond lyondell s and its joint ventures control  such as general economic conditions  international events and circumstances  competitor actions  and governmental regulation in the united states and abroad  can cause volatility in the price of raw materials and other operating costs  as well as significant fluctuations in demand for lyondell s and its joint ventures products  and can magnify the impact of economic cycles on 
table of contents lyondell s and its joint ventures businesses 
lyondell believes that the events in the middle east and venezuela have had a particular influence in recent months and may continue to do so unless tensions subside 
in addition  a number of lyondell s and its joint ventures products are highly dependent on durable goods markets  such as the housing and automotive markets  that are themselves particularly cyclical 
many of lyondell s and its joint ventures products are components of other chemical products that  in turn  are subject to the supply demand balance of both the chemical and refining industries and general economic conditions 
for example  mtbe is used as a blending component in gasoline  and therefore a substantial decline in gasoline prices could result in decreased profitability from mtbe sales 
if the global economy does not improve  demand for lyondell s and its joint ventures products and their income and cash flows would continue to be adversely affected 
with respect to lyondell s refining joint venture  management believes that the combination of the crude supply agreement and the products agreement generally tends to stabilize earnings and to reduce market driven volatility over the long term 
however  there are risks associated with these agreements 
see international operations and country risks below 
lyondell and its joint ventures may reduce production at or idle a facility for an extended period of time or exit a business because of high raw material prices  an oversupply of a particular product and or a lack of demand for that particular product  which makes production uneconomical 
these temporary outages sometimes last for several quarters or  in certain cases  longer and cause lyondell or its joint ventures to incur costs  including the expenses of maintaining and restarting these facilities 
it is possible that factors like increases in raw material costs or lower demand in the future will cause lyondell or its joint ventures to further reduce operating rates  or idle facilities or exit uncompetitive businesses 
international operations and country risks international operations and exports are subject to a number of risks  including currency exchange rate fluctuations  trade barriers  exchange controls  national and regional labor strikes  political risks and risks of increases in duties and taxes  as well as changes in laws and policies governing operations of companies in other countries 
in addition  earnings of non us subsidiaries and intercompany payments may be subject to income tax rules of countries other than the united states  which may reduce cash flow available to meet required debt service and other obligations of lyondell 
as discussed earlier  lcr is party to a long term crude supply agreement with pdvsa oil  a wholly owned subsidiary of pdvsa 
there are risks associated with enforcing the provisions of contracts with companies such as pdvsa oil that are non us affiliates of a sovereign nation 
additionally  all of the crude oil supplied by pdvsa oil under the crude supply agreement is produced in the republic of venezuela  which has experienced economic difficulties and attendant social and political changes and unrest in recent years  including during the recent national strike

environmental matters the company cannot predict with certainty the extent of its  its subsidiaries or its joint ventures future liabilities and costs under environmental  health and safety laws and regulations and the company cannot guarantee that they will not be material 
in addition  the company  its subsidiaries and its joint ventures may face liability for alleged personal injury or property damage due to exposure to chemicals and other hazardous substances at their facilities or chemicals that they otherwise manufacture  handle or own 
although these types of claims have not historically had a material impact on the company s  its subsidiaries or its joint ventures operations  a significant increase in the success of these types of claims could materially adversely affect the company s  its subsidiaries or its joint ventures business  financial condition  operating results or cash flow 
the production facilities of lyondell  equistar and lcr generally are required to have permits and licenses regulating air emissions  discharges to land or water and storage  treatment and disposal of hazardous wastes 
companies such as lyondell and its joint ventures that are permitted to treat  store or dispose of hazardous waste and maintain underground storage tanks pursuant to the resource conservation and recovery act rcra also are required to meet certain financial responsibility requirements 
the company believes that it and its joint ventures have all permits and licenses generally necessary to conduct its business or  where necessary  are applying 
table of contents for additional  amended or modified permits and that it and its joint ventures meet applicable financial responsibility requirements 
the policy of each of lyondell  equistar and lcr is to be in compliance with all applicable environmental laws 
lyondell and equistar also are each committed to responsible care  an international chemical industry initiative to enhance the industry s responsible management of chemicals 
the company s subsidiaries and joint ventures together with the industries in which they operate are subject to extensive national  state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning emissions to the air  discharges onto land or waters and the generation  handling  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of waste materials 
many of these laws and regulations provide for substantial fines and potential criminal sanctions for violations 
some of these laws and regulations are subject to varying and conflicting interpretations 
in addition  the company cannot accurately predict future developments  such as increasingly strict environmental laws  and inspection and enforcement policies  as well as higher compliance costs therefrom  which might affect the handling  manufacture  use  emission or disposal of products  other materials or hazardous and non hazardous waste 
some risk of environmental costs and liabilities is inherent in particular operations and products of the company and its joint ventures  as it is with other companies engaged in similar businesses  and there is no assurance that material costs and liabilities will not be incurred 
in general  however  with respect to the capital expenditures and risks described above  the company does not expect that it or its joint ventures will be affected differently than the rest of the chemicals and refining industry where the company s or its joint ventures facilities are located 
environmental laws may have a significant effect on the nature and scope of cleanup of contamination at current and former operating facilities  the costs of transportation and storage of raw materials and finished products and the costs of the storage and disposal of wastewater 
also  us superfund statutes may impose joint and several liability for the costs of remedial investigations and actions on the entities that generated waste  arranged for disposal of the wastes  transported to or selected the disposal sites and the past and present owners and operators of such sites 
all such responsible parties or any one of them  including the company may be required to bear all of such costs regardless of fault  legality of the original disposal or ownership of the disposed site 
the company and its joint ventures have on site solid waste management units at several of their facilities  which were used in the past to dispose of waste generated at the facilities 
it is anticipated that corrective measures will be necessary to comply with federal and state requirements with respect to these facilities 
the company also has liabilities under rcra and various state and non us government regulations related to eight current plant sites and four former plant sites 
the company is also responsible for a portion of the remediation of certain off site waste disposal facilities 
the company currently is contributing funds to the cleanup of two waste sites located near houston  texas under cercla and the superfund amendments and reauthorization act of the company also has been named  along with several other companies  as a potentially responsible party for six cercla sites near houston  texas 
the company s policy is to accrue remediation expenses when it is probable that such efforts will be required and the related expenses can be reasonably estimated 
estimated costs for future environmental compliance and remediation are necessarily imprecise due to such factors as the continuing evolution of environmental laws and regulatory requirements  the availability and application of technology  the identification of presently unknown remediation sites and the allocation of costs among the responsible parties under applicable statutes 
the company  its subsidiaries and its joint ventures  to the extent appropriate  have accrued amounts without regard to potential insurance recoveries or other third party reimbursements believed to be sufficient to cover current estimates of the cost for remedial measures at manufacturing facilities and off site waste disposal facilities based upon their interpretation of current environmental standards 
in the opinion of management  there is currently no material range of loss in excess of the amount recorded 
based on the establishment of such accruals  and the status of discussions with regulatory agencies described in this paragraph  the company does not anticipate any material adverse effect upon its financial statements or competitive position as a result of compliance with the laws and regulations described in this or the preceding paragraphs 
see also item legal proceedings and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations environmental matters 
in some cases  compliance with environmental  health and safety laws and regulations can only be achieved by capital expenditures 
in the years ended december   and  the company  its subsidiaries and its joint ventures on a basis spent  in the aggregate  approximately million  million and million  respectively  for environmentally related capital expenditures at existing facilities 
the increases in and 
table of contents capital expenditures resulted from new emission reduction rules  as discussed below 
the company currently estimates that environmentally related capital expenditures at company facilities and existing subsidiary and joint venture facilities on a basis will be approximately million for  prior to including any expenditures for proposed revisions to emission control standards for highly reactive volatile organic compounds hrvocs 
lyondell  equistar and lcr are still completing their assessment of the impact of the proposed hrvoc emission standards 
the eight county houston galveston region has been designated a severe non attainment area for ozone by the epa 
as a result  in december  the texas natural resource conservation commission  now known as the texas commission on environmental quality tceq  submitted a plan to the epa to reach and demonstrate compliance with the ozone standard by november ozone is a product of the reaction between volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides nox in the presence of sunlight  and is a principal component of smog 
emission reduction controls must be installed at the refinery and each of lyondell s two facilities and equistar s six facilities in the houston galveston region during the next several years 
the rules adopted as part of the tceq plan in december required a nox emission reduction in aggregate from the industry 
based on this requirement  lyondell estimated that aggregate related capital expenditures could total between million and million for lyondell  equistar and lcr before the deadline  and could result in higher annual operating costs 
in january  lyondell and an organization composed of industry participants filed a lawsuit to encourage adoption of an alternative plan to achieve the same air quality improvement with less negative economic impact on the region 
in response to the lawsuit  the tceq conducted an accelerated scientific review during and in december  the tceq adopted revised rules  which changed the required nox emission reduction levels from to while requiring new controls on emissions of hrvocs  such as ethylene  propylene  butadiene and butanes 
these new rules still require approval by the epa 
based on the nox reduction requirement  lyondell estimates that aggregate related capital expenditures could total between million and million for lyondell  equistar and lcr before the deadline  and could result in higher annual operating costs 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations environmental matters for a summary of the estimated capital expenditures for lyondell and its joint ventures to comply with the nox emission reduction requirements 
lyondell  equistar and lcr are still assessing the impact of the new hrvoc control requirements 
additionally  the tceq plans to make a final review of these rules  with final rule revisions to be adopted by may the timing and amount of these expenditures are subject to regulatory and other uncertainties  as well as obtaining the necessary permits and approvals 
at this time  there can be no guarantee as to the ultimate capital cost of implementing any final plan developed to ensure ozone attainment by the deadline 
see item legal proceedings environmental proceedings and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations environmental matters 
in the united states  the clean air act amendments of set minimum levels for oxygenates  such as mtbe  in gasoline sold in areas not meeting specified air quality standards 
however  the presence of mtbe in some water supplies in california and other states due to gasoline leaking from underground storage tanks and in surface water from recreational water craft has led to public concern about the use of mtbe 
certain federal and state governmental initiatives in the us have sought either to rescind the oxygen requirement for reformulated gasoline or to restrict or ban the use of mtbe 
lyondell s north american mtbe sales represented approximately of its total revenues 
at this time  lyondell cannot predict the impact that these initiatives will have on mtbe margins or volumes during lyondell intends to continue marketing mtbe in the us however  should it become necessary or desirable to significantly reduce mtbe production  lyondell would need to make capital expenditures to add the flexibility to produce alternative gasoline blending components  such as iso octane or ethyl tertiary butyl ether etbe  at its us based mtbe plants 
the current cost estimates for converting lyondell s us based mtbe plant to iso octane production range from million to million 
the profit margin for iso octane is likely to be lower than those historically realized on mtbe 
alternatively  lyondell is pursuing etbe viability through legislative efforts 
one key hurdle is equal access to the federal subsidy provided for ethanol blended into gasoline for the ethanol component of etbe 
lyondell s us based mtbe plant is capable of etbe production with minimal capital requirements 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and the results of operations environmental matters for further discussion 

table of contents the clean air act specified certain emissions standards for vehicles beginning in the model year and required the epa to study whether further emissions reductions from vehicles were necessary 
in  the epa concluded that additional controls on gasoline and diesel fuel were necessary to meet these emission standards 
new standards for gasoline were finalized in and will require refiners to produce a low sulfur gasoline by  with final compliance by a new on road diesel standard was adopted in january and will require refiners to produce ultra low sulfur diesel by june  with some allowance for a conditional phase in period that could extend final compliance until lyondell estimates that these standards will result in increased capital investment for lcr  totaling between million and million for the new gasoline standards and between million and million for the new diesel standard  before the implementation dates 
lyondell s proportionate share of lcr s capital expenditures would be between million and million 
in addition  these standards could result in higher operating costs for lcr 
equistar s business may also be adversely impacted if these standards increase the cost for processing fuel components 
commodity products lyondell and its joint ventures sell their products in highly competitive markets 
due to the commodity nature of certain of the products of lyondell and its joint ventures  competition in the markets is based primarily on price and to a lesser extent on performance  product quality  product deliverability and customer service 
as a result  lyondell and its joint ventures generally are not able to protect their market position for these products by product differentiation and may not be able to pass on cost increases to customers 
accordingly  increases in raw material and other costs may not necessarily correlate with changes in prices for these products  either in the direction of the price change or in magnitude 
specifically  timing differences in pricing between raw material prices  which may change daily  and contract product prices  which in many cases are negotiated only monthly or less often  sometimes with an additional lag in effective dates for increases  can have a negative effect on profitability 
operating hazards the occurrence of material operating problems at lyondell s or its joint ventures facilities  including  but not limited to  the events described below  may have a material adverse effect on the productivity and profitability of a particular manufacturing facility  or on the company as a whole  during and after the period of such operational difficulties 
the company s income and cash flow are dependent on the continued operation of the company s and its joint ventures various production facilities and the ability to complete construction projects on schedule 
although the company and its joint ventures take precautions to enhance the safety of their operations and minimize the risk of disruptions  the company s and its joint ventures operations  along with the operations of other members of the chemical and refining industries  are subject to hazards inherent in chemical manufacturing and refining and the related storage and transportation of raw materials  products and wastes 
these hazards include pipeline leaks and ruptures  explosions  fires  severe weather and natural disasters  mechanical failure  unscheduled downtime  labor difficulties  transportation interruptions  remediation complications  chemical spills  discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases  storage tank leaks  other environmental risks  and potential terrorist acts 
some of these hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life  severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and environmental damage  and may result in suspension of operations and the imposition of civil or criminal penalties 
furthermore  the company is also subject to present and future claims with respect to workplace exposure  workers compensation and other matters 
the company maintains property  business interruption and casualty insurance which it believes is in accordance with customary industry practices  but it is not fully insured against all potential hazards incident to its business  including losses resulting from war risks or terrorist acts 
as a result of market conditions  premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially and  in some instances  certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage 

table of contents joint venture risks a substantial portion of the company s operations is conducted through joint ventures 
the company shares control of these joint ventures with third parties 
the company s forecasts and plans with respect to these joint ventures assume that its joint venture partners will observe their obligations with respect to the joint ventures 
in the event that any of the company s joint venture partners do not observe their commitments  it is possible that the affected joint venture would not be able to operate in accordance with its business plans or that the company would be required to increase its level of commitment in order to give effect to such plans 
as with any such joint venture arrangements  differences in views among the joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or in failures to agree on major matters  potentially adversely affecting the business and operations of the joint ventures and in turn the business and operations of the company 
lyondell or any of the other owners of the joint ventures may transfer control of their joint venture interests or engage in mergers or other business combination transactions with a third party or with one or more of the other owners that could result in a change in control of lyondell or the joint venture or the other owners 
in many instances  such a transfer would be subject to an obligation to first offer the other owner an opportunity to purchase the interest 
lyondell and the other joint venture owners have discussed  and from time to time may continue to discuss  in connection with their ordinary course dialog regarding the joint ventures or otherwise  transactions that could result in a transfer or modification  directly or indirectly  of their ownership in a joint venture 
lyondell cannot be certain that any of the joint venture owners will not sell  transfer or otherwise modify their ownership interest in a joint venture  whether in a transaction involving third parties and or the other owner 
upon a transfer of an interest in equistar  the partnership agreement and key agreements between equistar and its owners would remain in place  and may not be modified without the consent of all of the owners  but the transfer could affect the governance of equistar  particularly because equistar s partnership agreement requires unanimous approval for some decisions 
equistar s credit facility provides that an event of default occurs if lyondell and or millennium cease to collectively hold at least a interest 
lcr s credit facility provides that an event of default occurs if lyondell and citgo cease to individually or collectively hold at least a interest 
in addition  lcr s credit facility provides that an event of default occurs if lyondell transfers its interest as a member of lcr to a person other than an affiliate or neither citgo nor any of its affiliates is a member of lcr 
potential acquisitions  divestitures and joint ventures lyondell and its joint ventures seek opportunities to maximize efficiency or value through various transactions 
these transactions may include various business combinations  purchases or sales of assets or contractual arrangements or joint ventures that are intended to result in the realization of synergies  the creation of efficiencies or the generation of cash to reduce debt 
to the extent permitted under lyondell s and its joint ventures credit facilities and other debt agreements  some of these transactions may be financed with additional borrowings by lyondell or its joint ventures or by the issuance of equity securities 
although these transactions are expected to yield longer term benefits if the expected efficiencies and synergies of the transactions are realized  they could adversely affect the results of operations of lyondell or its joint ventures in the short term because of the costs associated with such transactions

although lyondell believes the current expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  they do involve certain assumptions  risks and uncertainties  and lyondell can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to have been correct 
lyondell s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including the cyclical nature of the chemical and refining industries  the availability  cost and volatility of raw materials and utilities  uncertainties associated with the united states and worldwide economies  including those due to political tensions in the middle east and elsewhere and the potential for war  current and potential governmental regulatory actions in the united states and regulatory actions and political unrest in other countries  industry production capacity and operating rates  the supply demand balance for lyondell s and its joint ventures products  competitive products and pricing pressures  access to capital markets  potential terrorist acts  operating interruptions including leaks  explosions  fires  weather related incidents  mechanical failure  unscheduled downtime  labor difficulties  transportation interruptions  spills and releases and other environmental risks  technological developments  and lyondell s ability to implement its business strategies  including cost reductions

non gaap financial measures the body of generally accepted accounting principles is commonly referred to as gaap 
for this purpose  a non gaap financial measure is generally defined by the securities and exchange commission as one that purports to measure historical or future financial performance  financial position or cash flows but excludes or includes amounts that would not be so adjusted in the most comparable us gaap measure 
from time to time lyondell discloses so called non gaap financial measures  primarily ebitda  or earnings before interest  taxes and depreciation and amortization of long lived assets  as well as proportionate share data for lyondell and its joint ventures 
the non gaap financial measures described herein are not a substitute for the gaap measures of earnings  for which management has responsibility 
ebitda is a key measure used by the banking and high yield investing communities in their evaluation of economic performance 
accordingly  management believes that disclosure of ebitda provides useful information 
table of contents to investors because it is frequently cited by financial analysts in evaluating companies performance and it is a key measure in the calculation of financial covenants contained in lyondell s credit facility and the indentures governing its senior debt 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition liquidity and capital resources and note to the consolidated financial statements 
management believes that inclusion of ebitda in certain disclosures is useful because it increases the visibility of this component of the covenant analysis to an investor 
additionally  multiples of ebitda are one measure of the indicated fair value of certain long lived assets 
for example  lyondell used the multiples of ebitda approach in evaluating its goodwill for impairment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
lyondell also reports proportionate share data for lyondell and its joint ventures 
the joint ventures are not consolidated  but accounted for by the equity method of accounting 
accordingly  in lyondell s financial statements investors only see a single line item investments for the joint ventures in the balance sheet and one line item equity income from joint venture investments in the income statement 
as such  investors may not get a true appreciation of the magnitude of certain operating and financial data for lyondell and its joint ventures and the scope of their business activities 
management believes that reporting proportionate share data may give investors a more complete picture of the size and scope of the operating activities of lyondell and its joint ventures 
lyondell also periodically reports adjusted net income loss or adjusted ebitda  excluding certain items that are unusual in nature or not comparable from period to period and that are included in gaap measures of earnings 
management believes that excluding these items generally helps investors compare operating performance between two periods 
such adjusted data is not reported without an explanation of the items that are excluded 
item legal proceedings litigation matters on february   lcr filed a lawsuit against pdvsa and pdvsa oil in the united states district court  southern district of new york in connection with various force majeure declarations since april in the lawsuit  lcr alleges that the force majeure declarations by pdvsa and pdvsa oil are invalid and that pdvsa and pdvsa oil have breached the contracts related to the delivery of crude oil by pdvsa and pdvsa oil to lcr 
lcr is seeking monetary damages of at least million resulting from pdvsa oil s failure to pay lcr the amounts required by contract relating to past crude oil deliveries of less than the contractual amount 
lcr is also seeking declaratory relief relating to the force majeure declarations  and is seeking a declaratory interpretation of the disputed contract provisions in order to clarify the rights and obligations of the parties for the remaining duration of the contracts  which expire in december on may   the defendants filed a motion to dismiss lcr s complaint on the ground that the act of state doctrine prevented the court from deciding lcr s breach of contract claims 
lcr opposed the defendants motion 
the motion to dismiss was submitted to the court for decision on june  the court has not yet ruled on defendants motion 
the company and its joint ventures are  from time to time  defendants in lawsuits  some of which are not covered by insurance 
many of these suits make no specific claim for relief 
although final determination of legal liability and the resulting financial impact with respect to any such litigation cannot be ascertained with any degree of certainty  the company does not believe that any ultimate uninsured liability resulting from the legal proceedings in which it or its joint ventures currently are involved directly or indirectly will individually  or in the aggregate  have a material adverse effect on the business or financial condition of the company 
however  the adverse resolution in any reporting period of one or more of these suits could have a material impact on lyondell s results of operations for that period without giving effect to contribution or indemnification obligations of co defendants or others  or to the effect of any insurance coverage that may be available to offset the effects of any such award 
although lyondell and its joint ventures are involved in numerous and varied legal proceedings  a significant portion of its outstanding litigation arose in four contexts claims for personal injury or death allegedly arising out of exposure to the products produced by the respective entities  claims for personal injury or death  and or property damage allegedly arising out of the generation and disposal of chemical wastes at superfund and other

environmental proceedings on january   equistar and lcr  individually  and lyondell  individually and as part of the bcca appeal group a group of industry participants  filed a lawsuit against the tceq in state district court in travis county  texas to encourage the adoption of the plaintiffs alternative plan to achieve the same air quality improvement as the tceq plan  with less negative economic impact on the region 
in june  the parties entered into a consent order with respect to the lawsuit 
pursuant to the consent order  the tceq agreed to review by june the scientific data for ozone formation in the houston galveston region 
in october  the epa approved the original tceq plan  and the bcca appeal group filed a timely petition for judicial review of that action in the united states fifth circuit court of appeals in january in december  the tceq adopted revised nox and hrvoc rules in response to this litigation 
for a discussion of the impact of these rules  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations environmental matters 
on march   the plaintiffs filed for a voluntary dismissal of the case brought in state district court in travis county  texas 
the petition for judicial review filed in january regarding the epa approval of the original december tceq plan the reduction requirement remains active before the united states fifth circuit court of appeals 
in addition  from time to time the company receives notices from federal  state or local governmental entities of alleged violations of environmental laws and regulations pertaining to  among other things  the disposal  emission and storage of chemical and petroleum substances  including hazardous wastes 
although the company has not been the subject of significant penalties to date  such alleged violations may become the subject of enforcement actions or other legal proceedings and may individually or in the aggregate involve monetary sanctions of  or more exclusive of interest and costs 
in april  the illinois attorney general s office filed a complaint in grundy county  illinois circuit court seeking monetary sanctions for releases into the environment at millennium s morris  illinois plant in alleged violation of state regulations 
the morris  illinois plant was contributed to equistar on december  in connection with the formation of equistar 
equistar now believes that a civil penalty in excess of  could result  without giving effect to contribution or indemnification obligations of others 
equistar does not believe that the ultimate resolution of this complaint will have a material adverse effect on the business or financial condition of equistar 
in connection with the transfer of assets and liabilities from arco to the company prior to its initial public offering in  the company agreed to assume certain liabilities arising out of the operation of the company s integrated petrochemicals and refining business prior to july  the company and arco entered into an agreement  updated in the revised cross indemnity agreement  whereby the company agreed to defend and indemnify arco against certain uninsured claims and liabilities which arco may incur relating to the operation of the business of the company prior to july   including certain liabilities that may arise out of pending and future lawsuits 
for current and future cases related to company products and company operations  arco and the company bear a proportionate share of judgment and settlement costs according to a formula that allocates responsibility based on years of ownership during the relevant time period 
under the revised cross indemnity agreement  the company assumed responsibility for its proportionate share of future costs for waste site matters not covered by arco insurance 
in connection with the arco chemical acquisition  the company is successor to a cross indemnity agreement between arco and arco chemical relating to claims or liabilities that arco may incur relating to its former ownership and operation of the oxygenates and polystyrenics businesses of arco chemical for periods after july  on april   arco was acquired by bp 
subject to the uncertainty inherent in all litigation  management believes the resolution of the matters pursuant to these indemnity agreements will not have a material adverse effect upon the consolidated financial statements of the company 
lyondell s environmental liability totaled million at december  based on the company s latest assessment of potential future remediation costs 
this amount comprises liability for remediation responsibility retained by arco chemical in connection with the sale of a plant in and liability related to several owned plant facilities  including the channelview facility  and federal superfund sites for amounts ranging from less than million to million per site 
lyondell is involved in administrative proceedings or lawsuits relating to a 
table of contents minimal number of other superfund sites 
the company estimates  based on currently available information  that potential loss contingencies associated with these sites  individually and in the aggregate  are not significant

in addition to comparisons of annual operating results with results of the prior year  lyondell chemical company lyondell has included  as additional disclosure  certain trailing quarter comparisons of fourth quarter operating results to third quarter operating results 
the businesses of lyondell and its joint venture s are highly cyclical  in addition to experiencing some less significant seasonal effects 
trailing quarter comparisons may offer important insight into the current business direction of lyondell and its joint ventures 
references to industry benchmark prices and costs are generally to industry prices and costs reported by chemical marketing associates  incorporated cmai  except that crude oil and natural gas benchmark price references are to industry prices reported by platts  a reporting service of the mcgraw hill companies 
overview industrial production in the us  a key indicator of demand for products of lyondell and equistar chemicals  lp equistar  contracted an estimated in compared to a contraction in and growth of nearly in despite the contraction  lyondell and equistar generally experienced increased demand for most products during compared to the contraction resulted in generally lower demand and sales volumes for lyondell and equistar in compared to crude oil and natural gas prices have generally been indicators of the level and direction of movement of raw material and energy costs for lyondell and equistar 
the following table shows the average benchmark prices for crude oil and natural gas for the three year comparison period as well as benchmark sales prices for ethylene and propylene  which equistar produces and sells 
propylene is also a key raw material for lyondell s intermediate chemicals and derivatives segment 
average benchmark price for the year and percent change versus prior year average percent change percent change crude oil dollars per barrel natural gas dollars per million btus ethylene cents per pound propylene cents per pound the considerable volatility in raw material prices during the three year period is not apparent in the annual average raw material prices shown in the table above 
for example  the benchmark price of crude oil trended upward from a low of per barrel in january to a high of per barrel in november  a increase 
benchmark crude oil prices then trended downward to a low of per barrel in december  a decrease from the november high 
during  benchmark crude oil prices trended upward to per barrel in december  a increase from the december low 
benchmark natural gas prices rose from per million btus in january to a historical high of per million btus in january  a increase 
benchmark natural gas prices then trended downward to a low of per million btus in october  an decrease from the january spike 
during  benchmark natural gas prices resumed an upward trend  increasing to per million btus in december  a increase from the october low 
significant volatility in raw material costs tends to put pressure on product margins  as sales price increases generally tend to lag behind raw material cost increases 
conversely  when raw material costs decrease  customers tend to demand immediate relief in the form of lower sales prices 
these dynamics are particularly pronounced during periods of excess industry capacity and contributed to the trough conditions experienced by the chemical industry in and 
table of contents other significant events in included the august  acquisition by lyondell of occidental petroleum corporation s occidental interest in equistar 
lyondell financed this acquisition by issuing series b common stock  warrants and a right to a contingent payment to a subsidiary of occidental

as a result of the transactions  lyondell currently has a interest in equistar  while occidental has an approximate ownership interest in lyondell 
results of operations lyondell s operating income relates to the intermediate chemicals derivatives ic d business segment 
lyondell s activities in the petrochemicals  polymers and refining business segments are conducted through its interests in equistar and lcr 
lyondell accounts for its investments in equistar and lcr using the equity method of accounting  as discussed under critical accounting policies  below 
through april   lyondell s methanol operations were conducted through its joint venture ownership interest in lyondell methanol company  lp lmc  which was not a reportable segment for financial disclosure purposes 
effective may   lmc was wholly owned by lyondell and the methanol results were included in the ic d segment from that date 
the effects of consolidating the lmc operations  which previously had been accounted for using the equity method  were not material 
lyondell chemical company revenues and operating income lyondell s operating income was million in  million in and million in lyondell s operating results are reviewed in the discussion of the ic d segment below 
income loss from equity investment in equistar lyondell s equity investment in equistar resulted in a loss of million in compared to a loss of million in and income of million in the million increase in lyondell s equity loss from equistar was primarily due to deterioration in equistar s earnings in the fourth quarter combined with lyondell s ownership percentage increasing from to in august on a basis  equistar s loss decreased to million in from million in due primarily to million of goodwill amortization and million of port arthur facility closing costs  which were included in annual results 
lyondell s share of these costs in was million 
apart from these items  equistar s loss  on a basis  would have increased million in as a decrease in petrochemicals segment operating income and higher interest expense was only partly offset by a decrease in the polymers segment operating loss 
the petrochemicals segment operating income decreased as a result of lower product margins in compared to conversely  the polymers segment operating loss decreased due to higher product margins in compared to the decrease of million in lyondell s income from its equity investment in equistar in compared to primarily reflected lower petrochemicals segment margins as well as lower volumes for both the petrochemicals and polymers segments 
the lower petrochemicals margins were due to lower sales prices  which decreased more than raw material costs  in compared to petrochemical margins were also negatively affected by decreases in prices for co products propylene  benzene and butadiene during the lower sales prices and volumes reflected weaker demand in polymers segment operating results were comparable to results for also included lyondell s share of shutdown costs for equistar s port arthur  texas polymer facility  or million before tax 
income from equity investment in lcr lyondell s income from its equity investment in lcr was million in  million in and million in in  lcr s net income was negatively impacted by lower crude oil deliveries under lcr s crude supply agreement csa with pdvsa petr leo  sa pdvsa oil compared to the periods 
see the crude supply agreement section of note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the csa 
lcr maintained crude oil processing levels through increased purchases of spot market crude oil  which had significantly lower margins in the periods compared to the periods and compared to csa crude oil margins 
operating results benefited from lower 
table of contents natural gas prices in compared to the improvement in compared to was primarily due to higher deliveries and increased margins under the csa in as well as higher margins on spot market volumes in this was partially offset by the negative effect of a major scheduled maintenance turnaround during the fourth quarter interest expense interest expense was million in  million in and million in the decrease in compared to was principally due to the full year effect in of debt reductions made in during  lyondell retired a total of billion of debt  primarily using net proceeds of the march  asset sale to bayer 
interest income interest income was million in  million in and million in the decrease in compared to reflected lower interest rates in the higher interest income reflected higher cash balances for part of the year as a result of proceeds from the asset sale to bayer 
the cash proceeds were used to retire debt during  resulting in lower cash balances and lower interest income during interest rates in were also lower than in income tax the effective tax rate was compared to in and in both the and effective rates reflected a tax benefit from operating losses incurred during the year 
the lower rate reflected the effect of taxes on non us income 
the effective tax rate also reflected the effect of non us earnings taxed at higher rates  but this was more than offset by a benefit from a change in estimate of prior year items 
the change in estimate of prior year items primarily represented certain tax effects related to the sale of assets to bayer in the tax rate of reflected  in part  a federal tax benefit from a financial restructuring of lyondell s european operations and the attendant recognition of certain foreign exchange translation losses 
extraordinary losses extraordinary losses  net of income taxes  were million in  million in  and million in during  lyondell retired a significant portion of term loan e in the principal amount of million and amended its credit facility 
as a result  lyondell recognized a million prepayment premium and the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs of million  or a total  after tax  of million as an extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt 
the debt was retired using proceeds from million of fixed rate debt issued in july and million of fixed rate debt issued in december the extraordinary item for consisted of the write off of million of unamortized debt issuance costs and amendment fees related to the early repayment of million principal amount of variable rate debt 
the after tax charge of million was reported as an extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt 
the debt was retired using net proceeds from million of fixed rate debt issued in december the extraordinary item for consisted of the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and amendment fees of million and prepayment premiums of million 
the total of million  or million after tax  related to the early retirement of billion of debt  primarily using net proceeds from the bayer asset sale 
beginning in  these items will be reclassified to be included in income before extraordinary items 
see anticipated accounting changes 
net income loss lyondell had a net loss of million in  a net loss of million in and net income of million in the trend of net income loss is affected by certain items described below annual goodwill amortization of million after tax ceased effective january  see accounting changes below 
during the third quarter  lyondell exited the aliphatic diisocyanates adi business and shut down its adi operations at its lake charles  louisiana facility 
the decision reflected the limited ongoing strategic value to lyondell of the adi business and lyondell s poor competitive position in the adi business 
the decision resulted in a pretax non cash charge of million  or million after tax  in the net loss for included this million after tax charge and lyondell s after tax share  or million  of equistar s port arthur shutdown costs 

table of contents on march   lyondell completed the sale of the polyols business and ownership interests in its us po manufacturing operations to bayer for approximately billion 
the sale of assets generated a total pretax gain of million  or million after tax  during the extraordinary losses on early debt retirement  net of income taxes of million in  million in and million in have been discussed above under extraordinary losses 
beyond the items described above  the increased net loss in compared to was primarily due to lower product margins at lyondell and equistar in as a result of ongoing industry overcapacity 
in addition to the impact of the items described above  the net loss in compared to net income in was primarily the result of lower product margins and volumes at lyondell and equistar as a result of weaker global economies in  partly offset by lyondell s lower interest expense and higher earnings at lcr 
lyondell s interest expense decreased compared to due to the full year effect of debt reductions made during lcr s refining operations benefited from higher margins and increased deliveries under the csa with pdvsa oil 
pro forma the following condensed income statement presents the unaudited pro forma consolidated operating results for as if the march  sale of the polyols business had occurred as of the beginning of the pro forma income statement assumes that net proceeds of billion were used to retire debt in accordance with the provisions of lyondell s credit facility and indentures as of the beginning of the operating results for exclude the after tax gain on the asset sale of million  or per share

fourth quarter versus third quarter lyondell s fourth quarter net loss of million compares to a net loss for the third quarter of million 
while the fourth quarter included an million after tax extraordinary charge from early debt retirement  a substantial portion of the decrease in profitability was due to lower operating results in equistar s petrochemicals and polymers segments  and lyondell s increased equity interest therein  as well as lower operating results in lyondell s ic d segment in the fourth quarter equistar s and lyondell s business segments were affected by higher raw material and energy costs  scheduled maintenance turnaround activity  the normal seasonality of some products and weaker demand in the fourth quarter due to ongoing economic and political uncertainties 
higher raw material costs in the fourth quarter impacted equistar and lyondell 
energy costs also increased in the fourth quarter  particularly impacting equistar s operating results 
scheduled maintenance turnarounds also negatively impacted both equistar s products and lyondell s tdi business during the fourth quarter these effects were partly offset as lcr s earnings increased despite a national strike in venezuela that negatively affected csa deliveries in december while lcr received and processed full csa volumes

table of contents revenues revenues of billion in increased from revenues of billion in as higher sales volumes were substantially offset by lower sales prices 
sales volumes for po and derivatives increased primarily due to higher demand for po in urethanes markets and higher bdo volumes due to the bdo plant start up in these higher volumes were partly offset by lower tdi sales volumes and the absence of adi sales due to  respectively  tdi maintenance turnarounds and the shut down of the adi operations in the third quarter sales volumes also increased for sm and for tba and derivatives  primarily mtbe  in compared to higher sm sales volumes in were due to the expected start up of a new po sm plant in the netherlands and higher export sales  primarily to asia 
the lower average sales prices were primarily due to lower sales prices for po and derivatives and mtbe 
the lower po and derivatives average sales prices  to a large extent  reflected weaker demand for po derivatives and industry overcapacity 
the lower mtbe average sales prices primarily reflected lower gasoline prices in compared to revenues of billion in decreased from billion in partly due to the sale of the polyols business as of march  the polyols business accounted for million in sales revenues and million pounds in sales volumes in apart form the effect of the sale of the polyols business  sales revenues decreased million  or  compared to due to lower prices and lower volumes  reflecting weaker demand in sm accounted for nearly half of this decrease on significantly lower prices and lower volumes

apart from these items  operating income decreased million from the decrease primarily reflected lower product margins for po derivatives and higher fixed costs due to the startup of the new bdo plant 
these negative effects were partly offset by the benefits of higher sm and tdi margins  higher sales volumes and the sale of the unprofitable adi business in the third quarter lower po derivatives margins reflected a weaker pricing environment in as noted above 
higher sm margins reflected a stronger sm market in most of compared to tdi margins improved on lower raw materials costs and supply shortages that led to higher sales prices in operating income of million in decreased million from operating income of million in the decrease was primarily due to the gain on sale of assets to bayer of million in  lower margins and volumes for tdi  sm and po in  the million restructuring charge in  described above  and the sale of the polyols business on march  tdi margins and volumes were down significantly in due to weak demand in urethanes markets  which also affected po

apart from these items  the net loss for would have been million compared to the net loss of million for this million increase in the net loss primarily reflected a million decrease in petrochemicals segment operating income and million of higher interest expense  partly offset by a million improvement in the polymers segment operating loss 
petrochemicals segment operating income decreased as sales prices decreased more than raw material costs  resulting in lower petrochemicals product margins in compared to the polymers segment operating loss was reduced as raw material costs  primarily ethylene and propylene  decreased more than the decreases in average polymers product sales prices  resulting in higher polymers product margins in compared to equistar had a net loss in of million compared to net income of million for the significant decrease of million primarily reflected lower petrochemicals segment margins as well as lower volumes for both the petrochemicals and polymers segments 
the lower petrochemicals margins were due to lower sales prices  which decreased more than raw material costs  in compared to the lower sales prices and volumes reflected weaker industry demand in the polymers segment operating loss was comparable to results for also included the million of costs associated with the shutdown of the port arthur  texas polyethylene facility in the first quarter both periods included goodwill amortization 
fourth quarter versus third quarter equistar had a net loss of million in the fourth quarter compared to net income of million in the third quarter fourth quarter performance was primarily impacted by higher raw material costs 
the benchmark cost of ethylene production increased by approximately cents per pound  or  in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter during the fourth quarter these cost increases were only partly offset by a cent per pound reported increase in benchmark ethylene sales prices 
equistar also was affected by a scheduled maintenance turnaround of the chocolate bayou  texas olefins plant in the fourth quarter this heavy liquid cracking plant has significant co product production capabilities and normally further processes olefins by product volumes from other equistar plants and from outside purchases 
equistar was not able to utilize this capability during the turnaround

equistar s sales prices in averaged lower than in  reflecting lower raw material costs and low demand growth coupled with excess industry capacity 
benchmark ethylene sales prices averaged cents per pound in  a decrease compared to these lower ethylene sales prices were slightly offset by higher propylene sales prices 
benchmark propylene sales prices averaged higher in than in revenues of billion in decreased compared to revenues of billion for as a result of lower average sales prices and lower sales volumes in benchmark ethylene sales prices averaged lower in compared to  while benchmark propylene sales prices averaged lower 
equistar s sales volumes decreased compared to due to weaker business conditions in operating income operating income of million in decreased million from million in as sales prices decreased more than raw material costs  resulting in lower product margins 
the effect of the lower product margins was only partly offset by the benefit of a increase in sales volumes  which was in line with industry demand growth 
operating income of million in decreased million from million in the decrease was primarily due to lower product margins and  to a lesser extent  lower sales volumes 
the lower margins primarily reflected lower sales prices for ethylene and for co products  such as propylene and benzene  in compared to the lower prices and volumes were due to weaker market demand in compared to

lower sales prices in reflected generally lower raw material costs compared to sales volumes increased due to stronger demand in compared to revenues of billion in decreased compared to revenues of billion in due to a decrease in average sales prices and a decrease in sales volumes 
the decreases in sales prices and volumes were both due to weaker demand in operating loss the operating loss of million in decreased million compared to the operating loss of million in the million improvement was due to higher polymers product margins and  to a lesser extent  higher sales volumes 
margins improved in compared to  as decreases in sales prices were less than the decreases in polymers raw material costs 
the operating loss of million was comparable to the operating loss of million in as the effect of lower polymers sales prices was offset by lower raw material costs 
unallocated items the following discusses costs and expenses that were not allocated to the petrochemicals or polymers segments 
other operating costs and expenses these include unallocated general and administrative expenses and  in and  goodwill amortization 
in addition  included facility closing costs of million 
unallocated expenses were million in  million in and million in the decrease from to was primarily due to goodwill amortization of million that ceased in see note to the consolidated financial statements and the million of facility closing costs included in equistar discontinued production at its higher cost port arthur  texas polyethylene facility in february and shut down the facility 
during  equistar recorded a million charge  which included environmental remediation liabilities of million  other exit costs of million and severance and pension benefits of million for approximately people employed at the port arthur facility 
the remaining million balance primarily related to the write down of certain assets 

table of contents lyondell citgo refining lp lyondell s activities in the refining segment are conducted through its interest in lcr 
refining segment overview beginning in  pdvsa oil declared a force majeure and began reducing deliveries to lcr under the csa from the  barrels per day contractual rate and did not restore them to the  barrels per day contractual level until october see crude supply agreement section of note to the consolidated financial statements 
during  processing of csa volumes averaged  barrels per day  which forced lcr to make spot purchases of crude oil to maintain production levels 
a strong gasoline market during helped improve the margins that lcr realized on its spot purchases of crude oil 
during  processing of extra heavy venezuelan crude oil under the csa averaged  barrels per day  despite a major maintenance turnaround in the fourth quarter as volumes were accelerated into the first nine months of this resulted in higher than contract level csa crude oil processing rates during the first nine months of  allowing lcr to attain the near contract processing rate of  barrels per day for the full year the strong gasoline market continued through the third quarter  benefiting lcr s margins on spot purchases of crude oil 
beginning in march  pdvsa oil again reduced deliveries of extra heavy venezuelan crude oil to lcr under the csa based on a declaration of force majeure 
although deliveries were restored to contract levels in the third quarter  during the fourth quarter  a national strike in venezuela again disrupted deliveries of csa crude oil to lcr 
lcr compensated for this loss of supply through reductions of csa inventory and increased spot purchases of crude oil 
the net combination of these factors resulted in lower average csa crude oil processing rates of  barrels per day for the full year weaker industry refining margins during reduced the margins that lcr realized on its spot purchases of crude oil compared to  when industry refining margins were relatively higher 
the following table sets forth  in thousands of barrels per day  sales volumes for lcr s refined products and processing rates at the refinery for the periods indicated for the year ended december  refined products sales volumes gasoline diesel and heating oil jet fuel aromatics other refined products total refined products volumes crude processing rates crude supply agreement other crude oil total crude processing rates revenues revenues for lcr  including intersegment sales  were billion in  billion in and billion in revenues for increased compared to the increase was primarily due to a increase in sales volumes  partly offset by lower sales prices 
total crude processing rates averaged  barrels per day in  a increase compared to  barrels per day in spot market crude processing rates  however  averaged  barrels per day in compared to only  barrels per day in as a result of lower csa crude oil deliveries in 
table of contents revenues for decreased compared to the decrease was primarily attributable to lower sales prices and lower sales volumes  which decreased nearly 
the lower sales prices generally reflected downward pressure from lower crude oil prices in compared to the lower sales volumes were primarily due to the effects of the fourth quarter turnaround 
interest expense lcr s net interest expense was million in  million in and million in interest expense included interest on loans payable to partners of million in  million in  and million in interest expense decreased in compared to due to lower interest rates  which benefited lcr s variable rate debt  and lower amortization expense related to debt issuance costs 
debt issuance cost amortization was higher in as a result of the refinancing of lcr s debt in may and again in september lcr s debt was refinanced again in july and december interest expense also decreased in compared to due to lower interest rates 
extraordinary loss lcr had a million extraordinary loss in and a million extraordinary loss in  both related to the early retirement of its million term loan and million revolving credit facility  which were refinanced in december and july see lcr liquidity and capital resources below 
the extraordinary losses consisted of the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs 
net income lcr s net income was million in  million in and million in while lcr s net income of million was comparable to net income of million in  there were significant offsetting factors 
in  as noted in the overview above  lcr s net income was negatively impacted by lower csa crude oil deliveries compared to lcr maintained crude oil processing levels through increased purchases of spot market crude oil  which had significantly lower margins in compared to and compared to csa crude oil margins 
the negative effects of lower csa volumes and lower spot margins in were partly offset by lower energy costs and lower interest costs compared to in addition  a major planned maintenance turnaround in the fourth quarter and an outage related to tropical storm allison in the second quarter negatively affected operating results 
the million net income improvement in compared to was primarily due to higher margins and increased deliveries under the csa  higher margins on spot market volumes and lower fixed costs 
these benefits were partly offset by the effect of the major fourth quarter planned turnaround and higher natural gas costs 
the negative impact of the turnaround on operating results was estimated at approximately million 
lcr had unplanned outages in that negatively affected operating results during the first nine months of however  lcr had a planned turnaround in the second quarter that had a similar negative effect on operating results during fourth quarter versus third quarter lcr had net income of million in the fourth quarter  a million increase compared to net income of million in the third quarter despite a brief rate reduction in late december due to the strike in venezuela  lcr processed approximately  barrels per day of csa crude oil in the fourth quarter compared to  barrels per day in the third quarter lcr maintained the  barrels per day csa processing rate partly as a result of drawing down csa crude oil inventory 
spot market crude oil volumes decreased  but margins were higher than third quarter  leading to a higher fourth quarter contribution from spot crude oil purchases 
increases in the cost of natural gas were offset by processing lower cost crude oil from inventory and by timing impacts inherent in the csa terms 

table of contents financial condition operating activities lyondell s operating activities in generated cash of million compared to million in and million in the increase in compared to was primarily due to a federal income tax refund of million and million of lower cash expenditures for maintenance turnarounds  systems implementation  interest and employee benefits  partly offset by a million lower benefit from reductions in the controllable components of working capital receivables  inventory and payables 
the income tax refund  received in  was reflected in prepaid expenses and other current assets at december  although other noncurrent liabilities increased million at december  on the consolidated balance sheets  the increase was primarily due to the minimum pension liability  which did not affect cash flow 
see pension obligations below 
investing activities on august   lyondell increased its equity interest in equistar by acquiring occidental s interest 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements  items and business and properties development of business and financing activities below 
as a result  lyondell currently has a interest in equistar 
in connection with the acquisition  lyondell issued certain equity securities and a contingent right to occidental

lyondell s higher capital expenditures included initial spending on the po project prior to formation of the po joint venture with bayer see note to the consolidated financial statements  and expansion of a tdi plant in france 
lyondell s capital spending will increase over levels as a result of the timing of contributions related to the po project  which is expected to be completed in the second half of changes in the timing of other projects also shifted spending from into equistar s capital expenditures included million related to the early termination and expiration of certain railcar leases 
equistar may pursue new leases for a portion of these railcars

furthermore  lcr deferred a portion of fourth quarter cash distributions as a result of uncertainties in cash flow stemming from the national strike in venezuela 
lcr resumed cash distributions in the first quarter of however  the timing and level of future distributions remains uncertain 
during  lyondell contributed million to a mutual insurance company formed by lyondell and other companies in the industry  including equistar and lcr  to provide catastrophic business interruption and excess property damage insurance coverage for its members 
financing activities on august   lyondell completed certain transactions with occidental 
as a result of these transactions  occidental received an equity interest in lyondell  including million shares of newly issued lyondell series b common stock  five year warrants to acquire five million shares of lyondell original common stock at per share  and a right to a contingent payment equivalent in value to of equistar s cash distributions related to and  up to a total of million  payable in cash  series b common stock or original common stock  as determined by lyondell 
as a result of the transactions with occidental  lyondell has two series of common stock outstanding  original common stock and series b common stock 
lyondell paid a regular quarterly cash dividend of per share of original common stock in the first three quarters of  totaling million 
on october   the board of directors of lyondell declared a regular quarterly dividend of per share of original common stock to shareholders of record as of the close of business on november  the regular quarterly dividend on each share of outstanding original common stock totaling million was paid in cash on december  lyondell elected to pay the regular quarterly dividend on each share of outstanding series b common stock in kind in the form of  shares of series b common stock on december  following these transactions  occidental has an approximate equity interest in lyondell as of december  in december  lyondell issued million principal amount of senior secured notes due  using net proceeds  after discount and fees  of million to prepay million of the principal amount outstanding under term loan e of the credit facility and to pay a million prepayment premium 
in early july  lyondell completed debt and equity offerings  as well as amendments to its credit facility  to the bdo transaction documents and to the indentures related to its senior notes  increasing cash by 
table of contents approximately million 
lyondell issued million principal amount of senior secured notes due  using proceeds of million to prepay million of the principal amount outstanding under term loan e of the credit facility and to pay a million prepayment premium 
the remaining net proceeds  after discount and fees  of approximately million were used for working capital and general corporate purposes 
lyondell also issued million shares of common stock  receiving net proceeds of million that were used for working capital and general corporate purposes 
the amended credit facility extended the maturity of the revolving credit facility from july to june  reduced the size of the revolving credit facility from million to million  made certain financial ratio requirements less restrictive  made the covenant limiting acquisitions more restrictive and added a covenant limiting certain non regulatory capital expenditures 
the bdo transaction documents were also amended to incorporate the revised covenants from the credit facility 
also  after receiving consents from the holders of the senior secured and senior subordinated notes  lyondell amended the indentures related to those notes 
the principal indenture amendment revised a limitation that had restricted payment of lyondell s current per share annual cash dividend to a specified number of shares 
as a result of the amendment  the number of shares with respect to which the per share annual cash dividend may be paid is no longer restricted by the covenants 
lyondell paid fees totaling million related to the amendments 
lyondell had previously obtained amendments to the credit facility and the financial ratio requirements in september and march lyondell also made debt payments of million during primarily using proceeds of certain asset sales  principally assets related to the adi business  as required by the terms of the credit facility 
deferred tax assets the deferred tax assets classified as current assets decreased by million during the reduction primarily represented a change in the timing of anticipated realization of the tax benefits of domestic net operating loss nol carryforwards 
these benefits  which are expected to be realized within the next few years  have been reclassified from current assets to net long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
entering  management believed that the benefit of these nol carryforwards would be realized through reduction of us taxes that otherwise would have been payable as a result of taxable earnings in however  operating results during were adversely affected by the escalation of raw material costs and by continuing disappointing economic conditions 
the uncertainties created by the political unrest in the middle east and elsewhere compounded the uncertainty as to the timing and extent of the anticipated upturn in world economic activity 
based on the above factors  management concluded that it was appropriate to classify the deferred tax assets related to the nol carryforwards as non current 
there was no change in management s expectation that these deferred tax assets will be fully realized 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources lyondell s balance sheet remains highly leveraged 
as of december   long term debt  including current maturities  totaled billion  or approximately of total capitalization 
in addition  as of december  lyondell s joint ventures had approximately billion of debt see joint venture debt below and lyondell remains contingently liable as a guarantor of million of that debt 
in january  standard poor s s p rating service of the mcgraw hill companies placed lyondell s debt on creditwatch with negative implications  while moody s investors service moody s changed the rating outlook on lyondell s debt to negative from stable 
both agencies cited concern over the financial performance of lcr  while moody s also cited continuing weak financial performance at lyondell and equistar 
in february  s p took lyondell off creditwatch  affirmed lyondell s ratings and changed the rating outlook to negative 
a downgrade of lyondell s debt rating could affect its borrowing costs  its ability to refinance and could result in termination of the receivables sales agreement 
see receivables sale below 

table of contents lyondell s ability to pay or refinance its debt will depend on future operating performance  which will be affected by general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory  business and other factors  many of which are beyond its control 
lyondell believes that conditions will be such that cash balances  cash generated from operating activities  and funds from lines of credit will be adequate to meet anticipated future cash requirements  including scheduled debt repayments  necessary capital expenditures  ongoing operations and dividends 
however  if future operating cash flows are less than currently anticipated  lyondell may be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures  sell assets  or reduce operating expenses 
at december   lyondell had cash on hand of million and other short term investments of million 
in addition  the million revolving credit facility  which matures in june  was undrawn at december  amounts available under the revolving credit facility are reduced to the extent of certain outstanding letters of credit provided under the credit facility  which totaled million as of december  in addition to long term debt  lyondell also is required to make payments relating to various other types of obligations  some of which were incurred in lieu of financing to obtain the right to use assets 
the following tables summarize  as of december   lyondell s minimum payments for long term debt  operating leases  and other contractual obligations and guarantees for the next five years and thereafter 
payments due by period millions of dollars total thereafter contractual obligations long term debt purchase obligations operating leases minimum lease payments residual value guarantee capital commitments total commitment expiration by period total thereafter other commitments guarantees of equistar debt long term debt the amended credit facility and the amended indentures pertaining to lyondell s senior secured notes and senior subordinated notes contain covenants that  subject to exceptions  restrict sale and leaseback transactions  lien incurrence  debt incurrence  dividends  investments  non regulatory capital expenditures  certain payments  sales of assets and mergers 
in addition  the credit facility requires lyondell to maintain specified financial ratios and consolidated net worth  as defined in the credit facility 
financial ratio requirements under the lyondell credit facility become increasingly restrictive on a quarterly basis 
the breach of these covenants could permit the lenders to declare the loans immediately payable and could permit the lenders under lyondell s credit facility to terminate future lending commitments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of lyondell s long term debt and credit facility 
lyondell was in compliance with all such covenants as of december  as a result of continuing adverse conditions in the industry  in march  lyondell obtained amendments to its credit facility to provide additional financial flexibility by easing certain financial ratio requirements 
the bdo transaction documents were also amended to incorporate the revised covenants from the credit facility 
see operating leases below 
purchase obligations lyondell is party to various unconditional obligations to purchase products and services  principally for utilities and industrial gases  as summarized in the above table 
in addition to the items shown in the table above  lyondell is committed to purchase minimum quantities of tdi at plant cost from rhodia 
table of contents through such annual commitments currently are estimated at approximately million pounds of tdi per year 
these commitments are designed to assure sources of supply and are not expected to be in excess of normal requirements 
see the commitments and tdi agreements sections of note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of lyondell s commitments and contingencies  including these purchase obligations 
operating leases lyondell leases various facilities and equipment under noncancelable lease arrangements for various periods 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for related operating lease disclosures 
in july  lyondell began leasing a new butanediol bdo production facility in the netherlands  known as bdo  under an operating lease with an initial term of years 
construction of the facility was financed by an unaffiliated entity that had been established for the purpose of serving as lessor with respect to this facility 
future minimum annual lease payments under the operating lease  amounting to million per year using december  exchange rates and interest rates  are equivalent to interest on the lessor s cost of construction 
lyondell may  at its option  renew the lease for four additional five year terms or may purchase the facility at any time during the lease terms at the lessor s cost of construction 
if lyondell does not exercise the purchase option before the end of the last renewal period  the facility will be sold 
in the event the sales proceeds are less than the lessor s cost of construction  lyondell will pay the difference to the lessor  but not more than the guaranteed residual value of million euros  or million  using december  exchange rates 
note to the consolidated financial statements on lease commitments includes a description of this lease obligation 
capital commitments at december   major capital commitments primarily consisted of lyondell s share of those related to the construction of a world scale po facility  known as po  in the netherlands 
see the capital commitments section of note to the consolidated financial statements for related capital commitment disclosures 
advances from customers in addition to the items reflected in the table above  lyondell received advances from customers in and in connection with long term sales agreements under which lyondell is obligated to deliver product at a price representing a discount from prevailing market prices 
these advances are treated as deferred revenue and included in other liabilities 
lyondell amortizes this deferred revenue to earnings based on volumes shipped 
the unamortized balance of such advances totaled million and million as of december  and  respectively 
receivables sale in december  lyondell amended its existing receivables purchase agreement with an independent issuer of receivables backed commercial paper  extending the term until december under the terms of the agreement  lyondell agreed to sell  on an ongoing basis and without recourse  designated accounts receivable 
lyondell is obligated to sell new receivables as existing receivables are collected and must maintain  at least  certain minimum specified debt ratings on its senior secured and senior unsecured debt 
the agreement currently permits the sale of up to million of domestic accounts receivable 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the amount of receivables permitted to be sold is determined by a formula 
as of december  and  the balance of lyondell s accounts receivable sold  which is not reflected in the table above  was million 
pension obligations lyondell maintains several defined benefit pension plans  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   the projected benefit obligation for lyondell s plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by million 
subject to future actuarial gains and losses  as well as actual asset earnings  lyondell will be required to fund the million  with interest  in future years 
the minimum required contribution may reach an annual rate of approximately million by  due to past investment losses and relatively low current contribution levels 
pension contributions were million  million and million for the years  and  and are estimated to be approximately million for during  and  lyondell recorded additional minimum pension liabilities of million  million and million  respectively  with a charge to other comprehensive income 
the million accrual  which is not reflected in the table above  recognized accumulated pension benefit obligations in excess of pension plan assets at december  guarantees of equistar debt lyondell is guarantor of million of equistar debt and a co obligor with equistar for million of debt as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
joint venture debt at december   the outstanding debt of lyondell s joint ventures to parties other than lyondell was billion for equistar and million for lcr 
this debt is not carried on lyondell s balance sheet because  except for the amounts described in the preceding section  lyondell has no obligation with respect to that debt 
the ability of the joint ventures to distribute cash to lyondell is reduced by current adverse business conditions and their respective debt service obligations 
equistar liquidity and capital resources equistar s credit facility and the indenture governing equistar s senior unsecured notes contain covenants that  subject to exceptions  restrict sale and leaseback transactions  investments  non regulatory capital expenditures  certain payments  lien incurrence  debt incurrence  sales of assets and mergers 
in addition  the credit facility requires equistar to maintain certain specified financial ratios 
the financial ratio requirements under the equistar credit facility become increasingly restrictive on a quarterly basis 

table of contents the breach of these covenants could permit the lenders to declare the loans immediately payable and could permit the lenders under equistar s credit facility to terminate future lending commitments 
furthermore  a default under equistar s debt instruments which results in  or permits  the acceleration of more than million of indebtedness would constitute a cross default under lyondell s credit facility 
equistar obtained amendments to its credit facility in late march  making certain financial ratio requirements less restrictive  making the covenant limiting acquisitions more restrictive and adding a covenant limiting certain non regulatory capital expenditures 
the amendment increased the interest rate on the credit facility by per annum 
equistar was in compliance with all covenants under its debt instruments as of december  as a result of continuing adverse conditions in the industry  in march  equistar obtained amendments to its credit facility to provide additional financial flexibility by easing certain financial ratio requirements 
equistar has million principal amount of notes outstanding that mature in the first quarter equistar will seek appropriate opportunities to repay or refinance those notes  depending on available cash and market conditions 
debt ratings during  equistar s debt rating was lowered by two major rating agencies  moody s and s p 
moody s reduced equistar s noninvestment grade corporate debt rating from a ba to a ba s p reduced equistar s corporate debt rating from an investment grade bbb to a noninvestment grade bb 
both agencies cited lyondell s acquisition of occidental s interest in equistar as the reason for the downgrade 
the agencies stated that the acquisition resulted in a concentration of credit risk with lyondell  which now owns a interest in equistar and whose debt currently has a noninvestment grade credit rating 
s p also cited current trough conditions in the industry and equistar s billion goodwill write off 
in january  moody s changed the rating outlook for both equistar and lyondell to negative from stable 
moody s cited its belief that equistar s credit profile is limited by the financial strength of lyondell  whose outlook was changed primarily as a result of concerns regarding lcr 
the lowering of equistar s debt rating could affect its borrowing costs  its ability to refinance in the future and could result in termination of the receivables sales agreement see receivables sale below 
railcar leases during  equistar leased certain railcars  under three operating leases  from unaffiliated entities established for the purpose of serving as lessors with respect to these leases 
one of these operating leases remains outstanding at december  this lease includes an option for equistar to purchase the railcars during the lease term 
if equistar does not exercise the purchase option  the affected railcars will be sold upon termination of the lease 
in the event the sales proceeds are less than the related guaranteed residual value  equistar will pay the difference to the lessor  but no more than the guaranteed residual value 
as described above under debt ratings  equistar s debt rating was lowered during  allowing the early termination of this railcar lease by the lessor 
as a result  equistar renegotiated the lease during  resulting in a payment of additional fees and a million prepayment  which is being amortized over the remaining lease term through the prepayment reduced the guaranteed residual value under the lease  and reduced future lease payments 
the guaranteed residual value at december  was million 
the other two railcar leases contained financial and other covenants substantially the same as those contained in equistar s credit facility discussed above 
under one of the leases  equistar amended the covenants to incorporate the march amendment to the credit facility 
the amendment required the payment of additional fees and a million prepayment  which was amortized in full through december  when the lease was terminated and equistar entered into a new lease arrangement with another lessor 
the new lease covered a substantial portion of the subject railcars  and equistar purchased the remaining railcars for million 
the new operating lease contains standard terms and does not guarantee a residual value or contain financial or other non standard covenants 
under the third railcar lease  the covenants were automatically updated with the march amendment to the credit facility 
this lease terminated in november  and equistar purchased the railcars for million 
equistar may pursue leases for a portion of the purchased railcars 

table of contents receivables sale during october  equistar entered into an agreement with an independent issuer of receivables backed commercial paper under which equistar sold receivables and received cash proceeds of million 
under the terms of the agreement  equistar agreed to sell  on an ongoing basis and without recourse  designated accounts receivable 
equistar is obligated to sell new receivables as existing receivables are collected 
the agreement has annual renewal provisions for up to three years and is subject to maintaining a debt rating of at least b by moody s and bb by s p 
equistar is seeking an amendment to reduce the minimum required debt ratings and expects the amendment to be effective prior to march  upon entering into the agreement  the commitment under the revolving credit facility was reduced by million  to million in accordance with the terms of the revolving credit facility and would not be restored if the receivables agreement were terminated 
equistar used the proceeds to reduce borrowing under the revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes 
as of december   the balance of equistar s accounts receivable sold was million 
lcr liquidity and capital resources in december  lcr completed the refinancing of its credit facilities  with a new million bank term loan facility and a million working capital revolving credit facility  both of which mature in june the facilities are secured by substantially all of the assets of lcr 
they replaced lcr s million term loan and million revolving credit facility  which were scheduled to mature in january loans payable to partners include million payable to lyondell and million payable to citgo 
these loans have been extended and will mature in december current business outlook in the first quarter  the industry experienced significantly higher and more volatile energy and raw material costs than in the fourth quarter lyondell and equistar have responded by implementing price increases in the first quarter for substantially all of the products in the ic d  petrochemicals and polymers segments 
however  the amounts and timing of implementation of these price increases are unlikely to offset the impact of the raw material cost increases being experienced in the first quarter at lcr  csa deliveries have returned to contract levels  beginning in february management believes that lcr has established both csa and spot market sources of supply that will enable lcr to operate at high processing rates until the situation in venezuela is resolved 
however  lcr s earnings in the early part of the first quarter were negatively affected by the national strike in venezuela that began in early december as a result of reduced csa crude oil deliveries and a subsequent and related force majeure declaration  which recent media reports indicate has been lifted  lcr purchased significant volumes of crude oil from alternate sources during january the crude oil from these alternate sources did not completely offset the financial impact of the reduced csa supplies from venezuela 
industry analysts forecast that the olefins industry will experience improved supply demand conditions in  driven by industry announcements of plant shutdowns and maintenance turnarounds 
however  unless global economic uncertainties and energy market issues are resolved  the impact of high raw material and energy costs could outweigh these benefits and could depress demand 
if global economic uncertainties and energy market issues are resolved  it should result in reduced raw material costs and increased industrial activity  which would benefit lyondell s and equistar s operations 
related party transactions lyondell makes significant purchases of raw materials from equistar and provides significant administrative services to equistar 
in addition  equistar and lcr  as well as other parties related to equistar and lcr  engage in significant transactions among themselves 
lyondell believes that such related party transactions are effected on terms substantially no more or less favorable than those that would have been agreed upon by third parties on an arm s length basis 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of transactions involving lyondell  equistar and lcr 
transactions between lyondell and occidental of a trade nature in were not significant 

table of contents critical accounting policies lyondell applies those accounting policies that management believes best reflect the underlying business and economic events  consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the us lyondell s more critical accounting policies include those related to the basis of presentation  long lived assets  including the costs of major maintenance turnarounds and repairs  accruals for long term employee benefit costs such as pension and postretirement costs  as well as accruals for taxes based on income 
inherent in such policies are certain key assumptions and estimates made by management 
management periodically updates its estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements based on its latest assessment of the current and projected business and general economic environment 
lyondell s significant accounting policies are summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements 
basis of presentation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of lyondell and its subsidiaries 
investments in joint ventures where lyondell exerts a certain level of management control  but lacks full decision making ability over all major issues  are accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
for the major unconsolidated joint ventures  including equistar and lcr  governance of each venture is generally based on equal representation from the partners who jointly control certain key management decisions 
these include approval of the strategic plan  capital expenditures and annual budget  issuance of additional debt and the appointment of executive management of the joint venture 
accordingly  these ventures are carried on the equity method  even though lyondell s ownership percentage may exceed 
long lived assets with respect to long lived assets  key assumptions include the estimates of useful asset lives and the recoverability of carrying values of fixed assets  goodwill and other intangible assets as well as the existence of any obligations associated with the retirement of fixed assets 
such estimates could be significantly modified and or the carrying values of the assets could be impaired by such factors as new technological developments  new chemical industry entrants with significant raw material or other cost advantages  uncertainties associated with the us and world economies  the cyclical nature of the chemical and refining industries  and uncertainties associated with governmental actions  whether regulatory or  in the case of lcr  with respect to the csa 
lyondell defers the costs of turnaround maintenance and repair activities in excess of million  amortizing such costs over the period until the next expected major turnaround of the affected unit 
during  and  cash expenditures of million  million and million  respectively  were deferred and are being amortized  generally over an average of years 
amortization in  and  of previously deferred turnaround costs was million  million and million  respectively 
the estimated useful lives of long lived assets range from to years 
depreciation and amortization of these assets  including amortization of deferred turnaround costs  under the straight line method over their estimated useful lives totaled million in if the useful lives of the assets were found to be shorter than originally estimated  depreciation charges would be accelerated 
additional information on long lived assets  deferred turnaround costs and related depreciation and amortization appears in note to the consolidated financial statements 
long term employee benefit costs the costs to lyondell of long term employee benefits  particularly pension and postretirement medical and life benefits  are incurred over long periods of time  and involve many uncertainties over those periods 
the net periodic benefit cost attributable to current periods is based on several assumptions about such future uncertainties  and is sensitive to changes in those assumptions 
it is management s responsibility  often with the assistance of independent experts  to select assumptions that in its judgment represent best estimates of those uncertainties 
it also is management s responsibility to review those assumptions periodically to reflect changes in economic or other factors that affect those assumptions 
the current benefit service costs  as well as the existing liabilities  for pensions and other postretirement benefits are measured on a discounted present value basis 
the discount rate is a current rate  related to the rate at which the liabilities could be settled 
lyondell s assumed discount rate is based on average rates published by moody s investor service  inc  and merrill lynch for high quality aa rating ten year fixed income securities 
for the purpose of measuring the benefit obligations at december   lyondell lowered its assumed discount rate from to  reflecting the general decline in market interest rates during the rate also will be used to measure net periodic benefit cost during a further one percentage point reduction in the assumed discount rate for lyondell  equistar  and lcr would increase lyondell s benefit obligation by approximately million  and would reduce lyondell s net income  including the impact on income from equity investments in equistar and lcr  by approximately million 
the benefit obligation and the periodic cost of postretirement medical benefits also are measured based on assumed rates of future increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits 
as of december   the assumed rate of increase was for through  for through and thereafter 
a one percentage point change in the health care cost trend rate assumption would have no significant effect on either the benefit liability or the net periodic cost  due to limits on lyondell s maximum contribution level under the medical plan 
the net periodic cost of pension benefits included in expense also is affected by the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption 
investment returns that are recognized currently in net income represent the expected return on plan assets rate applied to a market related value of plan assets which  for lyondell  is defined as the market value of assets 
the expected return on plan assets rate is normally changed less frequently than the assumed discount rate  and reflects long term expectations  rather than current fluctuations in market conditions 
lyondell s expected long term asset return on plan assets rate of has been based on the average level of earnings that its independent pension investment advisor had advised could be expected to be earned over time 
the expectation was based on an asset allocation of us equity securities expected return  non us equity securities expected return  and fixed income securities expected return that had been recommended by the advisor  and was adopted for the plans 
the actual rate of return on plan assets may differ from the expected rate due to the volatility normally experienced in capital markets 
management s goal is to manage the investments over the long term to achieve optimal returns with an acceptable level of risk and volatility 
based on the market value of plan assets at december   a one percentage point decrease in this assumption for lyondell  equistar and lcr would decrease lyondell s net income  including the impact on income from equity investments in equistar and lcr  by million 
over the three year period ended december   lyondell s actual return on plan assets was a loss averaging per year 
net periodic pension cost recognized each year includes the expected asset earnings  rather than the actual earnings or loss 
as a result of asset earnings significantly below the expected return on plan assets rate over the three year period  the level of unrecognized investment losses  together with the net actuarial gains and losses  is million at december  this unrecognized amount  to the extent it exceeds ten percent of the projected benefit obligation for the respective plan  will be recognized as additional net periodic benefit cost over the average remaining service period of the participants in each plan 
this annual amortization charge will be approximately million per year based on the december  unrecognized amount 
lyondell is currently in the process of obtaining an updated asset allocation study from the independent pension investment advisor upon which it may update plan asset allocations and expected return on plan asset rates 
in view of market returns in the last three years  it is likely that lyondell will decrease its assumption for expected return on plan assets for additional information on the key assumptions underlying these benefit costs appears in note to the consolidated financial statements 
accruals for taxes based on income with respect to income taxes  uncertainties exist with respect to interpretation of complex tax regulations  both federal and foreign 
management generally expects that lyondell s interpretations will prevail 
further details on lyondell s income taxes appear in note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents accounting changes effective january   lyondell implemented statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
implementation of sfas no 
and sfas no 
did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements of lyondell 
upon implementation of sfas no 
 lyondell reviewed its goodwill for impairment and concluded that goodwill was not impaired 
however  equistar reviewed its goodwill for impairment and concluded that the entire balance was impaired  resulting in a billion charge to equistar s earnings as of january  lyondell s then share of the equistar charge was offset by a corresponding reduction in the excess of lyondell s share of equistar s partners capital over the carrying value of lyondell s investment in equistar 
consequently  there was no net effect of the impairment on lyondell s earnings or investment in equistar 
as a result of implementing sfas no 
 lyondell s pretax income in and subsequent years is favorably affected by million annually because of the elimination of lyondell s goodwill amortization 
anticipated accounting changes lyondell expects to implement three significant accounting changes in  as discussed below 
to better reflect the full cost of employee compensation  lyondell has elected to adopt the fair value method of accounting for employee stock options  the preferred method as defined by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  issued by the fasb in december  provides three alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method  as well as requiring certain disclosures about the method employed and its effect on reported results 
lyondell will implement sfas no 
in  using the prospective method 
under this method  an estimate of the fair value of any options granted to employees during or thereafter will be charged to earnings over the related vesting period 
this change is expected to reduce earnings by to per share 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
the primary impact of the statement on lyondell  when implemented in  will be the classification of gains or losses that result from the early extinguishment of debt as an element of income before extraordinary items 
reclassification of prior period gains or losses that were originally reported as extraordinary items also will be required 
see results of operations and notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin no 
addresses situations in which a company should include in its financial statements the assets  liabilities and activities of another entity 
fin no 
applies immediately to entities created after january  and  for lyondell and equistar  will apply to older entities beginning in the third quarter lyondell expects the application of fin to result in the consolidation of the entity from which it leases bdo see liquidity and capital resources operating leases above 

table of contents the consolidation of this entity as of december   using exchange rates as of that date  would result in a net increase in property  plant and equipment of approximately million  a decrease in other liabilities of million  a million increase in debt and a million after tax charge  which will be reported as the cumulative effect of an accounting change 
equistar expects the application of fin to result in the consolidation of an entity from which it leases certain railcars 
see equistar liquidity and capital resources railcar leases above 
consolidation of this entity as of december  would result in a net increase in property  plant and equipment of approximately million  a decrease in prepaid expense of million  a million increase in debt and an immaterial charge to be reported as the cumulative effect of an accounting change 
other recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
addresses the recognition  measurement  and reporting of costs associated with exit and disposal activities  including restructuring activities and facility closings 
sfas no 
will be effective for activities initiated after december  lyondell does not expect adoption of sfas no 
or sfas no 
to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements 
fin no 
expands required disclosures for certain types of guarantees for the period ended december  and requires recognition of a liability at fair value for guarantees granted after december  lyondell has provided required disclosures with respect to guarantees in notes  and to the consolidated financial statements 
environmental matters various environmental laws and regulations impose substantial requirements upon the operations of lyondell 
lyondell s policy is to be in compliance with such laws and regulations  which include  among others  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla or superfund as amended  the resource conservation and recovery act rcra and the clean air act amendments 
lyondell does not specifically track all recurring costs associated with managing hazardous substances and pollution in ongoing operations 
such costs are included in cost of sales 
lyondell  equistar and lcr also make capital expenditures to comply with environmental regulations 
such capital expenditures totaled approximately million  million and million for  and  respectively  on a basis for lyondell  equistar and lcr 
the increases in and capital expenditures resulted from new emission reduction rules  discussed in the next paragraph below  and lyondell currently estimates that these rules will result in further increases in expenditures to approximately million  on a basis  in  prior to including any expenditures for proposed revisions to emission control standards for highly reactive  volatile organic compounds hrvoc 
lyondell is still completing its assessment of the impact of the proposed hrvoc emission standards 
the eight county houston galveston region has been designated a severe non attainment area for ozone by the us environmental protection agency epa 
emission reduction controls for nitrogen oxides nox must be installed at lcr s refinery and each of lyondell s two facilities and equistar s six facilities in the houston galveston region during the next several years 
recently adopted revisions by the regulatory agencies changed the required nox reduction levels from to 
under the previous reduction standard  lyondell estimated that aggregate related capital expenditures could total between million and million for lyondell  equistar and lcr before the deadline 
under the revised standard  lyondell estimates that capital expenditures would decrease to between million and million for lyondell  equistar and lcr 
the following table summarizes the range of projected capital expenditures for lyondell and its principal joint ventures to comply with the nox emission reduction requirements 
table of contents millions of dollars from to nox capital expenditures basis lyondell equistar lcr total nox capital expenditures nox capital expenditures lyondell share lyondell equistar lcr total lyondell share of nox capital expenditures however  the savings from this revision could be offset by the costs of stricter proposed controls over hrvocs 
lyondell  equistar and lcr are still assessing the impact of the proposed hrvoc revisions and there can be no guarantee as to the ultimate capital cost of implementing any final plan developed to ensure ozone attainment by the deadline 
the timing and amount of these expenditures are also subject to regulatory and other uncertainties  as well as obtaining the necessary permits and approvals 
in the united states  the clean air act amendments of set minimum levels for oxygenates  such as mtbe  in gasoline sold in areas not meeting specified air quality standards 
however  the presence of mtbe in some water supplies in california and other states due to gasoline leaking from underground storage tanks and in surface water from recreational water craft has led to public concern about the use of mtbe 
certain federal and state governmental initiatives in the us have sought either to rescind the oxygen requirement for reformulated gasoline or to restrict or ban the use of mtbe 
lyondell s north american mtbe sales represented approximately of its total revenues 
the us house of representatives and the us senate each passed versions of an omnibus energy bill during and  respectively 
the senate version of the energy bill would have resulted in a ban on the use of mtbe 
the two energy bills were not reconciled during the conference process and an omnibus energy bill was not passed during both the us house of representatives and the us senate are expected to pursue an energy bill during the legislative cycle 
if this happens  it is likely that fuel content  including mtbe use  will be a subject of legislative debate 
factors which could be considered in this debate include the impact on gasoline price and supply and the potential for degradation of air quality 
at the state level  a number of states have legislated future mtbe bans 
of these  a number are mid west states that use ethanol as the oxygenate of choice 
bans in these states should not have an impact on mtbe demand 
however  connecticut  california and new york have bans of mtbe in place effective october   january   and january   respectively 
lyondell estimates that california represents of the us mtbe industry demand and of the worldwide mtbe industry demand  while connecticut and new york combined represent of the us mtbe industry demand and of the worldwide mtbe industry demand 
at this time  lyondell cannot predict the impact that these initiatives will have on mtbe margins or volumes during however  several major oil companies have announced plans  beginning in  to discontinue the use of mtbe in gasoline produced for california markets 
lyondell estimates that the california market mtbe volumes of these companies account for an estimated of us mtbe industry demand and of worldwide mtbe industry demand 
lyondell intends to continue marketing mtbe in the us however  should it become necessary or desirable to significantly reduce mtbe production  lyondell would need to make capital expenditures to add the flexibility to produce alternative gasoline blending components  such as iso octane or ethyl tertiary butyl ether etbe  at its us based mtbe plants 
the current cost estimates for converting lyondell s us based mtbe plant to iso octane production range from million to million 
the profit contribution for iso octane is likely to be lower than that historically realized on mtbe 
alternatively  lyondell is pursuing etbe viability through legislative efforts 
one key hurdle is equal access to the federal subsidy provided for ethanol blended into 
table of contents gasoline for the ethanol component of etbe 
lyondell s us based mtbe plant is capable of etbe production with minimal capital requirements 
see item a 
disclosure of market and regulatory risk regulatory risk 
the clean air act also specified certain emissions standards for vehicles  and in  the epa concluded that additional controls on gasoline and diesel fuel were necessary 
new standards for gasoline were finalized in and will require refiners to produce a low sulfur gasoline by  with final compliance by a new on road diesel standard was adopted in january and will require refiners to produce ultra low sulfur diesel by june  with some allowance for a conditional phase in period that could extend final compliance until lyondell estimates that these standards will result in increased capital investment for lcr  totaling between million to million for the new gasoline standards and between million to million for the new diesel standard  before the implementation dates 
lyondell s share of lcr s capital expenditures would be between million and million 
in addition  these standards could result in higher operating costs for lcr 
equistar s business may also be impacted if these standards increase the cost for processing fuel components 
as of december   lyondell s environmental liability for future assessment and remediation costs at its plant sites and a limited number of superfund sites totaled million 
the liabilities per site range from less than million to million and are expected to be incurred over the next two to seven years 
lyondell spent million to million annually for each of the last three years for environmental remediation matters 
lyondell estimates that expenditures will be approximately million in in the opinion of management  there is currently no material range of loss in excess of the amount recorded for these sites 
however  it is possible that new information about the sites for which the accrual has been established  new technology or future developments such as involvement in investigations by regulatory agencies  could require lyondell to reassess its potential exposure related to environmental matters 
item a 
disclosure of market and regulatory risk commodity price risk a substantial portion of lyondell s products and raw materials  as well as those of equistar and lcr  are commodities whose prices fluctuate as market supply and demand fundamentals change 
accordingly  product margins and the level of lyondell s profitability tend to fluctuate with changes in the business cycle 
lyondell tries to protect against such instability through various business strategies 
these include increasing the olefins plants raw material flexibility  entering into multi year processing and sales agreements  moving downstream into olefins derivatives products whose pricing is more stable  and the use of the deemed margin contract at lcr 
lyondell has made limited use of derivative instruments for commodity price hedging purposes 
no significant amount of such derivatives were outstanding at december  and equistar has  from time to time  entered into over the counter derivatives  primarily price swap contracts  related to crude oil to help manage its exposure to commodity price risk with respect to crude oil related raw material purchases 
as of december  and  there were no outstanding over the counter derivatives 
foreign exchange risk foreign exchange exposures result from cash flows between lyondell s us and non us operations and transactions denominated in currencies other than the local currency of a non us operating entity 
lyondell s non us operations account for approximately of consolidated revenues and of consolidated assets 
lyondell has used foreign currency forward contracts to manage its exposure related to euro denominated capital commitments related to the construction of the po plant in the netherlands 
these contracts were not designed to protect lyondell s reported results against exchange rate fluctuations 
at december   there were no foreign currency forward contracts outstanding 

table of contents interest rate risk lyondell is exposed to interest rate risk with respect to variable rate debt 
during  lyondell further reduced variable rate debt from million at december  to million at december   thereby reducing its exposure to interest rate risk to an immaterial level 
at december   equistar and lcr had variable rate debt of million and million  respectively  excluding the note payable by lcr to lyondell 
lyondell s exposure to interest rate risk at equistar and lcr is not material 
sensitivity analysis was used for both of the above analyses 
regulatory risk in the united states  the clean air act amendments of set minimum levels for oxygenates  such as mtbe  in gasoline sold in areas not meeting specified air quality standards 
however  the presence of mtbe in some water supplies in california and other states due to gasoline leaking from underground storage tanks and in surface water from recreational water craft has led to public concern about the use of mtbe 
certain federal and state governmental initiatives in the us have sought either to rescind the oxygen requirement for reformulated gasoline or to restrict or ban the use of mtbe 
see environmental matters above 
during  lyondell sold mtbe to bp plc bp pursuant to a sales contract  which expired december  and represented approximately of lyondell s worldwide mtbe sales volumes 
the contract provided for formula based prices that  historically  have been significantly higher than market prices 
if sales under the mtbe sales contract with bp had been priced at then prevailing mtbe market prices  lyondell s net income would have been reduced by approximately million 
lyondell anticipates that the mtbe production previously sold under this contract will be sold under market based annual sales contracts and in the spot market 
new air pollution standards promulgated by federal and state regulatory agencies in the us  including those specifically targeting the eight county houston galveston region  will affect a substantial portion of the operating facilities of lyondell  equistar and lcr 
compliance with these standards will result in increased capital investment during the next several years and higher annual operating costs for lyondell  equistar and lcr 
recently adopted revisions by the regulatory agencies change the required nitrogen oxides  or nox  reduction levels from to 
however  any potential resulting savings from this proposed revision could be offset by the costs of stricter proposed controls over hrvocs 
lyondell is still assessing the impact of these proposed regulations and there can be no guarantee as to the ultimate capital cost of implementing any final plan developed to ensure ozone attainment by the deadline
