organization habersham bancorp the company owns all of the outstanding stock of habersham bank habersham bank and the advantage group  inc habersham bank owns all of the outstanding stock of advantage insurers  inc advantage insurers 
prior to december  it also owned all of the outstanding stock of bancmortgage financial corp

during the year ended december   the company sold bancmortgage to the existing management of bancmortgage resulting in a loss of  the company s consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to reflect the operations of bancmortgage as discontinued 
management s discussion and analysis  which follows  relates primarily to habersham bank 
the company s continuing primary business is the operation of banks in rural and suburban communities in habersham  white  cherokee  and warren counties in georgia 
the company s primary source of revenue is providing loans to businesses and individuals in its market area 
critical accounting policies in reviewing and understanding financial information for the company  you are encouraged to read and understand the significant accounting policies which are used in preparing the consolidated financial statements of the company 
these policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements which are presented elsewhere in this annual report 
of these policies  management believes that the accounting for the allowance for loan losses is the most critical 
losses on loans result from a broad range of causes  from borrower specific problems to industry issues to the impact of the economic environment 
the identification of the factors that lead to default or non performance under a loan agreement and the estimation of loss in these situations is very subjective 
in addition  a dramatic change in the performance of one or a small number of borrowers can have a significant impact in the estimate of losses 
as described further below  management has implemented a process that has been applied consistently to systematically consider the many variables that impact the estimation of the allowance for loan losses 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions  the financial condition of borrowers and other factors 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the company to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
the allowance for loan losses methodology is based on a loan classification system 
for purposes of determining the required allowance for loan losses and resulting periodic provisions  the company identifies the problem loans in its portfolio and segregates the remainder of the loan portfolio into broad segments  such as commercial  commercial real estate  residential mortgage and consumer 
the company provides for a general allowance for losses inherent in the portfolio for each of the above categories 
the general allowance is calculated based on estimates of inherent losses which probably exist as of the evaluation date 
loss percentages used for non problem loans in this portion of the portfolio are based on historical loss factors 
the general allowance for losses on problem loans is based on a review and evaluation of these loans  taking into consideration financial condition and strengths of the borrower  related collateral  cash flows available for debt repayment  and known and expected economic conditions 
general loss percentages for the problem loans are determined based upon historical loss experience and regulatory requirements 
for loans considered impaired  specific allowances are provided in the event that the specific collateral analysis on each problem loan indicates that the liquidation of the collateral would not result in repayment of these loans if the loan is collateral dependent or if the present value of expected future cash flows on the loan are less than the balance 
in addition to these allocated reserves  the company has established an unallocated reserve of approximately  at december  the basis for the unallocated reserve is due to a number of qualitative factors  such as concentrations of credit and changes in the outlook for local and regional economic conditions 
certain economic factors could have a material impact on the loan loss allowance calculation and its adequacy 
the depth and duration of any economic recession would have an impact on the credit risk associated with the loan portfolio 
another factor that can impact the calculation is a consideration for concentrations in collateral which secure the loan portfolio 
the company s loan portfolio is secured primarily by commercial and residential real estate loans comprising approximately of the total loan portfolio 
while there is a risk that the appraised value of the real estate securing the loans in the portfolio could decrease in value during an economic recession  the majority of the real estate securing the loan portfolio is family residential properties which are not generally as affected by the down turns economy 
the company will from time to time make unsecured loans 
the risk to the company is greater for unsecured loans as the ultimate repayment of the loan is only dependent on the borrowers ability to pay 
the balance of unsecured loans at december  was million which does not pose a significant risk to the company 
the company is not aware of any large loan relationships that if defaulted would have a significant impact on the allowance for loan losses 
refer to the section entitled allowance for loan losses for an additional discussion of the key assumptions and methods used in determining the allowance for loan losses  as well as inherent risks in estimating the allowance

allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents a reserve for probable losses in the loan portfolio 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is evaluated periodically based on a review of all significant loans  with particular emphasis on impaired  non accruing  past due  and other loans that management believes require special attention 
the determination of the allowance for loan losses is subjective and based on consideration of a number of factors and assumptions 
as such  the accounting policy followed in the determination of the allowance is considered a critical accounting policy 
the allowance for loan losses methodology is based on a loan classification system 
for purposes of determining the required allowance for loan losses and resulting periodic provisions  the company identifies the problem loans in its portfolio and segregates the remainder of the loan portfolio into broad segments  such as commercial  commercial real estate  residential mortgage and consumer 
the company provides for a general allowance for losses inherent in the portfolio for each of the above categories

general loss percentages for the problem loans are determined based upon historical loss experience and regulatory requirements 
for loans considered impaired  specific allowances are provided in the event that the specific collateral analysis on each problem loan indicates that the liquidation of the collateral would not result in repayment of these loans if the loan is collateral dependent or if the present value of expected future cash flows on the loan are less than the balance 
in addition to these allocated reserves  the company has established an unallocated reserve of approximately  at december  the basis for the unallocated reserve is due to a number of qualitative factors  such as concentrations of credit and changes in the outlook for local and regional economic conditions 
management believes its allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb losses on loans outstanding at december  the allowance for loan losses allocation is based on subjective judgment and estimates and  therefore  is not necessarily indicative of the specific amounts or loan categories in which charge offs may ultimately occur

none of the mortgages are considered individually significant 
investment securities the company has classified its investment securities as available for sale and held to maturity 
the classification of certain investment securities as available for sale is consistent with the company s investment philosophy of maintaining flexibility to manage the securities portfolio 
at december  approximately million of investment securities were classified as available for sale

 the company recorded a net of tax cumulative effect loss of  on january  to reflect the fair value of forward commitments to sell mortgage backed securities held by bancmortgage 
the provisions of sfas no 
allow for a one time transfer of investment securities previously classified as held to maturity to available for sale upon adoption 
as a result  the company transferred approximately  of investment securities previously classified as held to maturity to its available for sale portfolio on january  in the normal course of business  as part of its former mortgage banking operations  the company extended interest rate lock commitments to borrowers who applied for loan funding and met certain credit and underwriting criteria 
such commitments were typically for short terms 
such commitments to originate fixed rate mortgage loans for resale and forward commitments to sell mortgage backed securities were the company s only derivative instruments 
the company s objective in entering into forward commitments to sell mortgage backed securities was to mitigate the interest rate risk associated with mortgage loans held for sale and commitments to originate fixed rate mortgage loans for resale 
if the fair value of the company s commitments to originate fixed rate mortgage loans for resale resulted in an asset  such asset was recorded only to the extent of losses in the forward commitments to sell mortgage backed securities 
losses were recorded on the company s commitments to originate fixed rate mortgage loans for resale when fair values were less than the carrying values 
the company recorded its forward commitments to sell mortgage backed securities at fair value and did not account for these as hedges 
during the year ended december   a gain in the amount of  relating to the change in fair value of forward commitments to sell mortgage backed securities was recorded in other income 
at december   the company did not have any derivative instruments

the company also had available repurchase agreement line of credit commitments with the national bank of commerce totaling  at december  of which none was advanced 
capital resources the company is subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimal capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on the company s financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  the company must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of the company s assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the company s capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings  and other factors 
quantitative measures established by regulations to ensure capital adequacy require the company to maintain minimum amounts and ratios set forth below in the table of total and tier i capital as defined in the regulations to risk weighted assets as defined  and of tier i capital as defined to average assets as defined 
management believes  as of december   that the company meets all capital adequacy requirements to which it is subject 
as of december   the most recent notifications from both the federal deposit insurance corporation and the federal reserve bank of atlanta categorized the bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
to be categorized as well capitalized  the bank must maintain minimum total risk based  tier i risk based and tier i leverage ratios as set forth in the following table 
there are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the bank s categories

cash dividends were paid at a rate of 
per share in each of march  june  september  and december for both and management is not aware of any required regulatory changes or any recommendation by any regulatory authority which will have a material effect on the company s liquidity  capital or results of operations 
interest rate sensitivity the objective of asset and liability management is to manage and measure the level and volatility of earnings and capital by controlling interest rate risk 
to accomplish this objective  management makes use of interest rate and income simulation models to perform current and dynamic projections of interest income and equity  as well as more traditional asset and liability management methods 
the company s historical performance in various economic climates is considered by management in making long term asset and liability decisions for the company 
the relative interest rate sensitivity of the company s assets and liabilities indicates the extent to which the company s net interest income may be affected by interest rate movements 
the company s ability to reprice assets and liabilities in the same dollar amounts and at the same time minimizes interest rate risks 
one method of measuring the impact of interest rate changes on net interest income is to measure  in a number of time frames  the interest sensitivity gap by subtracting interest sensitive liabilities from interest sensitive assets  as reflected in the following table 
such an interest sensitivity gap represents the risk  or opportunity  in repricing 
if more assets than liabilities are repriced at a given time in a rising rate environment  net interest income improves  in a declining rate environment  net interest income deteriorates 
conversely  if more liabilities than assets are repriced while interest rates are rising  net interest income deteriorates  if interest rates are falling  net interest income improves

at december   the company was able to meet such objective 
the interest rate sensitivity analysis has a positive one year gap of approximately million excess of interest earning assets to interest bearing liabilities repricing within one year 
however  the company s experience has shown that now  money market  and savings deposits of approximately million are less sensitive to short term rate movements  thus the positive one year gap is likely higher 
market risk market risk reflects the risk of economic loss resulting from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
the risk of loss can be reflected in either diminished current market values or reduced potential net interest income in future periods 
market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in the company s lending and deposit taking activities 
the structure of the company s loan and deposit portfolios is such that a significant decline in the prime rate may adversely impact net market values and interest income 
management seeks to manage this risk through the use of its investment securities portfolio 
the composition and size of the investment portfolio is managed so as to reduce the interest rate risk in the deposit and loan portfolios while at the same time maximizing the yield generated from the portfolio 
the company is also subject to equity risk as a result of changes in market values of its equity securities

inflation the company s assets and liabilities are generally monetary in nature 
therefore  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
see interest rate sensitivity above 
liquidity liquidity management involves the matching of the cash flow requirements of customers  either depositors withdrawing funds or borrowers needing loans  and the ability of the company to meet those requirements 
the company s liquidity program is designed and intended to provide guidance in funding the credit and investment activities of the company while at the same time ensuring that the deposit obligations of the company are met on a timely basis 
in order to permit active and timely management of assets and liabilities  these accounts are monitored regularly in regard to volume  mix  and maturity 
scheduled amortization and prepayments of loans  maturities and calls of investment securities and funds from operations provide a daily source of liquidity 
in addition  the company may and does seek outside sources of funds

however  deposit flows  calls of investment securities and prepayment of loans are strongly influenced by interest rates  general and local economic conditions and competition in the marketplace 
these factors reduce the predictability of the timing of these sources of funds

these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
the company s exposure to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument for commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit is represented by the contractual amounts of those instruments 
the company uses the same credit policies in making these commitments as it does for on balance sheet instruments and evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
at december   the company had outstanding loan commitments approximating  and standby letters of credit approximating  the amount of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary  for these financial instruments by the company  upon extension of credit  is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer 
collateral held  if any  varies but may include inventory  equipment  real estate  or other property 
the accounting loss the company would incur if any party to the financial instrument failed completely to perform according to the term of the contract and the collateral proved to be of no value is equal to the face amount of the financial instrument 
the company s commitments are funded through internal funding sources of scheduled repayments of loans and sales and maturities of investment securities available for sale or external funding sources through acceptance of deposits from customers or borrowing from other financial institutions
