item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this section contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  many of which are beyond our ability to control or predict 
thcr s actual results may differ substantially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and the related notes thereto 
terms not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them elsewhere in the form k 
general we have substantial indebtedness and interest expense which could limit capital expenditures and adversely affect our competitiveness 
our company has substantial indebtedness and interest expense 
at december   thcr s consolidated long term debt was approximately billion and its ratio of debt to capital was to interest expense as a percentage of net revenues was  and for the fiscal years ended december   and  respectively 
as previously announced  we have sought to refinance or modify the terms of thcr s and its subsidiaries public debt issues 
in march  we refinanced an aggregate principal amount of approximately million of debt with the net proceeds of the tch note offering 
see business  recent events  tch note offering 
upon consummation of the tch note offering  our consolidated long term debt was not reduced significantly and our consolidated interest expense will remain high 
capital expenditures  such as room refurbishment  
table of contents amenity upgrades and replacements and additions of new gaming equipment  are necessary from time to time to preserve the competitiveness of our properties 
in addition  construction of additional rooms at one or more of our atlantic city properties could be desirable in the future 
our high levels of interest expense  however  could limit our ability to make capital expenditures necessary to improve and upgrade our properties and preserve our competitive position 
we have substantial indebtedness maturing in  and we may seek to refinance this indebtedness on more favorable terms when and if market conditions are suitable 
we cannot assure you  however  that we will be successful in reducing our interest expense in any refinancing 
management believes that  based upon thcr s current cash flow forecasts for  thcr and its subsidiaries will have sufficient cash flows to meet their respective debt service and operating expense requirements throughout the ability of trump ac and its subsidiaries to pay interest on the tac notes billion principal amount and the ability of tch and tcf to pay interest on the tch notes million principal amount depends primarily on the ability of the trump casino properties to generate cash from operations sufficient for such purposes 
in the case of principal payments at maturity  the ability to refinance such indebtedness is also important 
the future operating performance of the trump casino properties is subject to general economic conditions  industry conditions  including competition and regulatory matters  and numerous other factors  many of which are unforeseeable or are beyond the control of the trump casino properties 
there can be no assurance that the future operating performance of the trump casino properties will be sufficient to generate the cash flows required to meet the debt service obligations of the trump casino properties 
the ability of the trump casino properties to pay the principal amount of their public debt at maturity whether scheduled or by acceleration thereof is primarily dependent upon their ability to obtain refinancing 
there is also no assurance that the general state of the economy  the status of the capital markets generally  or the receptiveness of the capital markets to the gaming industry or to thcr and its subsidiaries will be conducive to refinancing debt at any given time or on more favorable terms 
restrictions contained in the indentures governing our public indebtedness may impose limits on our ability to pursue certain business strategies 
the indentures governing our public indebtedness ie  the tac notes and tch notes contain operating and financial restrictions that limit our discretion on various business matters 
these restrictions include covenants limiting our ability to incur additional debt  grant liens  make capital expenditures  make investments  sell assets  merge or consolidate with another company  pay dividends and other distributions  issue stock of subsidiaries  and enter into transactions with affiliates 
these restrictions may reduce our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and gaming industry 
this reduced flexibility could hurt our results of operations and our ability to meet our debt service obligations with respect to our indebtedness 
we do not know how the borgata  when opened  will affect us 
in september  boyd gaming and mgm mirage  inc commenced their joint development of a acre site located in atlantic city s marina district for the construction of the borgata 
the borgata is expected to 
table of contents feature a story tower with  rooms and suites  as well as a  square foot casino  restaurants  retail shops  a spa and pool  and entertainment venues 
construction of the borgata is scheduled to be completed in the summer of we believe that the opening of the borgata will attract additional visitors to atlantic city  especially the marina district which could benefit trump marina 
it is also possible  however  that the borgata could have an adverse effect on our business and operations  including a reduction in net revenues caused by a loss of gaming patrons 
new york has enacted gaming legislation which may harm us  and other states may do so in the future 
we do not know how these initiatives will affect us 
in october  the new york state legislature passed extensive legislation that could adversely affect us 
the legislation permits three new casinos in western new york  one in niagara falls  one in buffalo and one on land owned by the seneca indian nation  all of which would be owned by the seneca indian nation 
the legislation also permits up to three casinos in the catskills in ulster and sullivan counties  also to be owned by native american tribes  which could open as early as mid in addition  the legislation allows slot machines to be placed in indian owned casinos 
video lottery terminals could be installed at five horse racing tracks across the state of new york and  if local governments approve  at certain other tracks 
finally  the law provides for new york joining the powerball lottery that operates in states with large jackpots 
the net effect of these facilities and other items  when operational  on atlantic city  including the trump atlantic city properties  cannot be predicted 
we believe  however  that a substantial amount of existing and potential new gaming customers could patronize such facilities instead of atlantic city  at least occasionally 
in january  a lawsuit was commenced contesting the above legislation package on the grounds that certain of its provisions were adopted in violation of new york state s constitution 
the likely outcome of this lawsuit cannot be ascertained at this time 
pennsylvania and maryland are among the other states currently contemplating some form of gaming legislation 
legislative proposals introduced in pennsylvania would potentially allow for a wide range of gaming activities  including riverboat gaming  slot machines at racetracks  video lottery terminals at liquor stores and the formation of a gaming commission 
maryland s proposed legislation would authorize video lottery terminals at some of maryland s racing facilities 
the results of the recent gubernatorial elections in pennsylvania and maryland have increased the likelihood of gaming legislation in such states 
since our market is primarily a drive to market  legalized gaming in pennsylvania  maryland or one or more states neighboring or within close proximity to new jersey could have a material adverse effect on the atlantic city gaming market overall  including the trump atlantic city properties 
a downturn in the regional economy and high energy and gasoline prices and adverse winter weather conditions could negatively impact our financial performance 
moderate or severe economic downturns or adverse conditions in the atlantic city and regional markets and surrounding areas may negatively affect our operations 
during periods of economic contraction  our revenues may decrease while some of our costs remain fixed  resulting in decreased earnings 
this is because gaming and other leisure activities we offer are discretionary expenditures and participation in such activities may decline during economic downturns because consumers have less disposable income 
even an uncertain economic outlook may adversely affect consumer spending in our gaming operations and related facilities  as consumers spend less in anticipation of a potential economic downturn 
furthermore  the effects  if any  of the hostilities in iraq on the economy generally and on the habits of consumers are not known 
a prolonged conflict with iraq and other uncertainties could adversely affect consumer spending  increase gasoline prices and  perhaps  adversely affect our operations 
we use significant amounts of electricity  natural gas and other forms of energy 
while no shortages of energy have been experienced  any substantial increases in the cost of electricity and natural gas in the united states may negatively impact our operating results 
the extent of any impact is subject to the magnitude and duration of the energy price increases and could be material 
also  a majority of our patrons drive to our property 
rising gasoline prices could reduce automobile travel and decrease the number of patrons to our properties 
in addition  adverse winter weather conditions reduce 
table of contents automobile travel 
as a result  our business  assets  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by a weakening of regional economic conditions  high gasoline prices and or adverse winter weather conditions 
we may incur losses that would not be covered by insurance and the cost of insurance will increase 
although we maintain insurance which is customary and  we believe  appropriate for our business  we cannot assure you that insurance will be available or adequate to cover all losses and damage to which our business or our assets might be subjected 
in connection with insurance renewals subsequent to september   the availability of insurance coverage for certain types of damages or occurrences has been diminished substantially 
consequently  we are self insured for certain risks and levels of risk 
the lack of insurance for certain types or levels of risk could expose us to significant losses in the event that an uninsured catastrophe occurred 
any uncovered losses may decrease our future operating income  require us to find replacements or repairs and reduce funds otherwise available to upgrade our property 
taxation of the gaming industry  already significant  may increase in the future which would reduce our profitability 
the casino industry represents a significant source of tax revenues to the various jurisdictions in which casinos operate 
we  as well as other gaming companies  are currently subject to significant state and local taxes and fees in addition to normal federal and state corporate income taxes 
new jersey taxes annual gaming revenues at the rate of and levies an annual investment alternative tax of on annual gaming revenue 
this obligation  however  can be satisfied by purchasing certain bonds or making certain investments in the amount of of annual gaming revenues 
in july  new jersey passed the new jersey business tax reform act  which  among other things  suspended the use of the net operating loss carryforwards for two years and introduced a new alternative minimum assessment under the new jersey corporate business tax based on gross receipts or gross profits 
future changes in new jersey s taxation of gaming companies cannot be predicted and any such changes could adversely affect our profitability 
from time to time  and as was the case in the second quarter of in indiana  various state and federal legislators have proposed changes in tax laws that affect the gaming industry 
in connection with permitting dockside gaming which we believe is advantageous  the indiana state legislature passed legislation effective july  that increased the gaming tax rates in indiana 
if a casino elects to become a dockside operations  the gaming tax rate structure changes from a flat tax rate of to a graduated scale with a maximum tax rate of  depending on gaming revenues levels 
trump indiana became a dockside operation in august in february  in response to state budgetary concerns  the governor of new jersey proposed increasing new jersey s casino gross revenue tax from to  to tax complimentaries and to impose a occupancy tax on hotel rooms 
the outcome of this tax proposal is uncertain at this time 
any tax increase imposed on atlantic city casinos  including the trump atlantic city properties  could reduce our profitability 
see business  the atlantic city market 
our success depends  in part  on the availability of qualified management and personnel and on our ability to retain such employees 
certain of our employees are required to be licensed by  or registered with  the new jersey casino control commission  indiana gaming commission and or the national indian gaming commission  depending upon the nature of their employment 
casino employees are subject to more stringent licensing requirements than non casino employees  and are required to meet applicable standards pertaining to such matters as financial responsibility  good character  ability  casino training  experience and in state residency 
these regulations have resulted in significant competition for eligible employees 
as a result  it may be difficult to attract  retain and train qualified employees due to the competition for employees with other gaming companies in our jurisdiction and nationwide 
a failure to attract or retain qualified management and personnel at all levels or the loss of our key executives could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents our right to use the trump name is subject to certain limitations 
subject to certain limitations  thcr has the exclusive right to use the trump name and mr 
trump s likeness in connection with gaming and related activities pursuant to a trademark license agreement between mr 
trump and thcr 
thcr s rights under the license agreement are secured by a security interest in the names trump  donald trump and donald j 
trump and variations thereof collectively  the trump names and related intellectual property rights collectively  the marks for use in connection with casino services  pursuant to a security agreement 
thcr  in turn  allows its subsidiaries to use the trump names under various parol licenses which do not create an enforceable license in favor of these subsidiaries 
if there were a default under the license agreement or the security agreement  thcr would have rights  subject to applicable state law  to enforce the rights and remedies contained in the security agreement 
thcr s subsidiaries would not have any such rights 
in the event of a foreclosure sale of the marks  the net amount realized in such sale by thcr might not yield the full amount of damages that thcr could sustain as a result of the default 
in addition  the existence of rights of others to use the trump names  including pursuant to any security interests in trademarks for non gaming hotels  could adversely affect the ability of thcr to realize the benefits of the security agreement 
see business  certain agreements  trademark license agreement 
gaming is a regulated industry and changes in the law could have a material adverse effect on our positions 
gaming in new jersey and indiana and at trump is regulated extensively by federal and state regulatory bodies  including the new jersey casino control commission or the ccc  the indiana gaming commission or the igc  the national indian gaming commission or the nigc and state and federal taxing  law enforcement and liquor control agencies 
see business  governmental and gaming regulation 
the company and its various officers and other qualifiers have received the licenses  permits and authorizations required to operate our properties 
failure to maintain or obtain the requisite casino licenses would have a material adverse effect on us 
our license to operate trump marina expires in may our licenses to operate trump plaza and trump taj mahal expire in june we timely filed applications to renew each license through july and a hearing is scheduled for late june although we believe the ccc will renew the licenses  no assurance can be given as to such renewal or as to what license conditions  if any  may be imposed by the ccc in connection with such renewals 
see business  governmental and gaming regulations  operating licenses 
in june  the igc granted trump indiana  inc a riverboat owner s license for the ownership and operation of a gaming vessel at buffington harbor  which was renewed in june and expires in june although we believe the igc will renew the license  no assurance can be given as to such renewal or as to what license conditions  if any  may be imposed by the igc in connection with such renewal 
gaming at trump is regulated extensively by federal  state and tribal regulatory bodies  including the nigc  the bureau of indian affairs  the tribal gaming authority and  to a lesser extent  by the california gambling control commission 
if new gaming regulations are adopted by the jurisdictions in which we operate  such regulations could impose restriction or costs that could have a significant adverse effect on us 
from time to time  various proposals have been introduced by the legislatures of new jersey and indiana that  if enacted  could adversely affect the tax  regulatory  operations or other aspects of the gaming industry and us 
we cannot assure you that legislation of this type will not be enacted in the future 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
management periodically evaluates the company s policies and the estimates and assumptions related to such policies 
the trump casino properties 
table of contents operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to regulations that describe and regulate operating and internal control procedures 
the company believes its most critical accounting policies and significant estimates are described below 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts the majority of the company s revenue is from gaming activities  and the majority of such revenue is derived from cash  which by nature does not require complex estimations 
the company does extend credit to customers on a discretionary basis to certain qualified patrons 
credit play as a percentage of total dollars wagered has been approximately for the past three years 
the trump casino properties establish credit limits based upon the particular patron s creditworthiness  as determined by an examination of various factors including a credit check of the patron  checking the patron s personal checking account balance  and checking the patron s credit limits and indebtedness at other casinos 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for those customers whose checks have been unable to be deposited due to non sufficient funds 
this allowance is based on a specific review of customer accounts as well as a review of the history of write offs of returned markers 
management believes that the reserve recorded is reasonable  however  these estimates could change in the near term based on actual collection experience with each returned marker 
long lived assets management has determined that the company s policy associated with its long lived assets and the related estimates is critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the company has a significant investment in long lived property and equipment 
management estimates that the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of these assets exceed the current carrying value of these assets 
any adverse change to the estimate of these undiscounted cash flows could necessitate an impairment charge that would adversely affect operating results 
management estimates the useful lives for the company s assets based on historical experience and the estimates of assets commercial lives 
should the actual useful life of a class of assets differ from the estimated useful life  an impairment charge would be recorded 
management reviews useful lives and obsolescence and assesses commercial viability of the company s assets periodically 
self insurance reserves self insurance reserves represent the estimated amounts of uninsured claims related to employee health medical costs  workers compensation  and personal injury claims that have occurred in the normal course of business 
these reserves are established by management based upon specific review of open claims  with consideration of incurred but not reported claims as of the balance sheet date 
the costs of the ultimate disposition of these claims may differ from these reserve numbers

financial condition liquidity and capital resources cash flows from operating activities of the trump casino properties are our primary source of liquidity 
to a lesser extent  we rely on capital lease financing for our capital resource needs 
our ability to borrow funds for our liquidity needs is severely restricted by covenants in the various indentures governing the public debt issues of our subsidiaries and by already high levels of indebtedness 
sources of our short term and long term liquidity include primarily i table win  ii slot win  iii room occupancy  iv food and beverage sales and

a variety of factors  including a decrease or change in the demand for our services  could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to service our debt obligations 
the trump atlantic city properties also compete with other atlantic city casino hotels based on the quality of customer service  the array of games offered  the attractiveness of a casino hotel and the extent and quality of the facilities and amenities

cash flow from operations was sufficient to provide for cash interest expense in and in prior years 
capital expenditures  however  were limited due primarily to the high level of interest expense on thcr s public debt issues 
as shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows in our financial statements  thcr has consistently generated sufficient cash for debt service and operating requirements 
management believes that  based upon its cash flow forecast for  thcr and its consolidated subsidiaries will have sufficient cash flows to meet their respective debt service and operating requirements throughout contractual obligations and commercial commitments

general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   a million  or  increase from million in the comparable period in the increase is primarily attributed to the write off of approximately million of crda deposits by the atlantic city casinos  with the carrying value of million  donated during the fourth quarter of  in exchange for the right to utilize other crda deposits for the development of an entertainment retail district project or projects

seasonality our cash flows from operating activities are seasonal in nature 
spring and summer are traditionally the peak seasons for the trump atlantic city properties  with autumn and winter being non peak seasons 
trump s peak seasons are late winter and spring 
trump indiana is not seasonal 
since the trump atlantic city properties account for the majority of our business  our operating results for the two quarters ending in march and december are not historically as profitable as the two quarters ending in june and september 
any excess cash flow achieved from operations during peak seasons is used to subsidize non peak seasons 
performance in non peak seasons is usually dependent on favorable weather and a long weekend holiday calendar 
in the event that we are unable to generate excess cash flows in one or more peak seasons  we may not be able to subsidize non peak seasons  if necessary
