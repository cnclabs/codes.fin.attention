item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the condensed financial review which follows presents management s discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and operating results of the company and its subsidiaries rockland  capital trust iii and capital trust iv 
independent capital trust iii and independent capital trust iv each have issued trust preferred securities to the public 
the company also had two other subsidiaries which were independent capital trust i and ii  each of which also issued trust preferred securities to the public  and were liquidated earlier this year upon redemption of their trust preferred securities 
the bank s subsidiaries consist of two massachusetts securities corporations  rtc securities corp 
i and rtc securities corp 
x  as well as south shore holdings  ltd 
south shore holdings  a holding company for rockland preferred capital corporation  a massachusetts real estate investment trust the reit 
the following should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto 
independent bank corp 
is a one bank holding company whose primary asset is its investment in rockland 
rockland is a state chartered commercial bank  which operates retail branches  seven commercial lending centers  three investment management offices and three mortgage banking centers  all of which are located in the plymouth  barnstable  norfolk and bristol counties of southeastern massachusetts and cape cod 
the bank s primary source of income is from providing loans to individuals and small to medium sized businesses in its market area 
independent capital trust iii and independent capital trust iv were formed for the purposes of issuing trust preferred securities and investing the proceeds of these securities in junior subordinated debentures issued by the company 
forward looking information this report on form k may contain certain forward looking statements  including without limitation  statements regarding i the level of allowance for loan loss  ii the rate of delinquencies and amounts of charge offs and iii the rates of loan growth 
moreover  the company may from time to time  in both written reports and oral statements by company management  express its expectations regarding future performance of the company 
these forward looking statements are inherently uncertain and actual results may differ from company expectations 
the following factors which  among others  could impact current and future performance include but are not limited to i adverse changes in asset quality and resulting credit risk related losses and expenses  ii adverse changes in the economy of the new england region  iii adverse changes in the local real estate market  as most of the company s loans are concentrated in southeastern massachusetts and a substantial portion of these loans have real estate as collateral  iv fluctuations in market rates and prices which can negatively affect the net interest margin  asset valuations and expense expectations  and v changes in regulatory requirements of federal and state agencies applicable to banks and bank holding companies  such as the company and rockland  which could have a materially adverse effect on the company s future operating results 
when relying on forward looking statements to make decisions with respect to the company  investors and others are cautioned to consider these and other risks and uncertainties 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies upon which our financial condition depends  and which involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments are as follows allowance for loan losses arriving at an appropriate level of allowance for loan losses involves a high degree of judgment 
the company s allowance for loan losses provides for probable losses based upon evaluations of known  and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
management uses historical information to assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses as well as the prevailing business environment  as it is affected by changing economic conditions and various external factors  which may impact the portfolio in ways currently unforeseen 
the allowance is increased by provisions for loan losses and by recoveries of loans previously charged off and reduced by loans charged off 
for a full discussion of the company s methodology of assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes by deferring income taxes based on estimated future tax effects of differences between the tax and book basis of assets and liabilities considering the provisions of enacted tax laws 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the company must also assess the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and establish a valuation allowance for those assets determined to not likely be recoverable 
management judgment is required in determining the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities  including projections of future taxable income 
although the company has determined a valuation allowance is not required for all deferred tax assets  there is no guarantee that these assets are recognizable 
valuation of goodwill intangible assets and analysis for impairment independent bank corp 
in part has increased its market share through the acquisition of entire financial institutions accounted for under the business combinations method of accounting  as well as from the purchase of financial institution s branches not the entire institution 
for acquisitions under the purchase method and the acquisition of financial institution branches  the company is required to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair value which is an estimate determined by the use of internal or other valuation techniques 
these valuation estimates result in goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill is subject to ongoing periodic impairment tests and is evaluated using various fair value techniques including multiples of price equity and price earnings ratios 
overview the company s total assets increased by million  or  from year end to a total of billion as of december  investment securities decreased by million  or  to million at december  from million a year earlier

consumer loans primarily consist of closed end installment loans  cash reserve loans  and home equity loans 
as of december   million  or  of the bank s gross loan portfolio  consisted of consumer loans compared to million  or  of the bank s gross loans at december  the bank s installment loans consist primarily of automobile loans  which amounted to million and million  at december  and  respectively 
consumer installment loans of million  decreased  or  in as of december  and  automobile loans of million represented and million represented  respectively  of the bank s consumer loan portfolio 
indirect automobile loans accounted for approximately of the bank s total installment loan originations during and  respectively 
as of december   installment loans other than automobile loans amounted to million compared to million as of december  these loans were constituted largely by fixed home equity loans as well as loans secured by recreational vehicles  motor homes  boats  mobile homes  and motorcycles 
other consumer loans have consisted primarily of cash reserve loans  home equity lines and small business lines 
the balances of other consumer loans increased million to million  or  in compared to million  in cash reserve loans are designed to afford the bank s customers overdraft protection 
cash reserve loans are made pursuant to previously approved unsecured cash reserve lines of credit 
the rate on these loans is subject to change due to market conditions 
as of december  and  million had been committed to but was unused under cash reserve lines of credit 
home equity loans may be made as a term loan or under a revolving line of credit secured by a first or second mortgage on the borrower s residence 
as of december   there were million in unused commitments under revolving home equity lines of credit compared to million at december  the following table sets forth the scheduled contractual amortization of the bank s loan portfolio at december  loans having no schedule of repayments or no stated maturity are reported as due in one year or less 
the following table also sets forth the rate structure of loans scheduled to mature after one year

generally  the actual maturity of loans is substantially less than their contractual maturity due to prepayments and  in the case of real estate loans  due on sale clauses  which generally gives the bank the right to declare a loan immediately due and payable in the event that  among other things  the borrower sells the property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid 
the average life of real estate loans tends to increase when current real estate loan rates are higher than rates on mortgages in the portfolio and  conversely  tends to decrease when rates on mortgages in the portfolio are higher than current real estate loan rates 
under the latter scenario  the weighted average yield on the portfolio tends to decrease as higher yielding loans are repaid or refinanced at lower rates 
due to the fact that the bank may  consistent with industry practice  roll over a significant portion of commercial and commercial real estate loans at or immediately prior to their maturity by renewing the loans on substantially similar or revised terms  the principal repayments actually received by the bank are anticipated to be significantly less than the amounts contractually due in any particular period 
in addition  a loan  or a portion of a loan  may not be repaid due to the borrower s inability to satisfy the contractual obligations of the loan 
the principal balance of loans serviced by the bank for investors amounted to million at december  and million at december  under its mortgage servicing arrangements  the bank generally continues to collect payments on loans  to inspect the mortgaged property  to make insurance and tax advances on behalf of borrowers and to otherwise service the loans and receives a fee for performing these services 
net servicing fee income amounted to million and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the bank also sells certain loans and does not retain servicing 
during and the bank originated and sold million and million of loans along with the servicing rights  respectively 
the servicing release premium on sold loans was approximately  in and  in loan origination fees that relate to loans sold by the bank are recognized as a component of mortgage banking income at the time of the loan sale 
under its sales agreements  the bank pays the purchaser of mortgage loans a specified yield on the loans sold 
the difference  after payment of any guarantee fee  is retained by the bank and recognized as fee income over the life of the loan 
in addition  loans may be sold at a premium or a discount with any resulting gain or loss recognized at the time of sale 
as of december  and  the bank s loan servicing asset was million and million  respectively 
amortization including impairment of the loan servicing asset included in net servicing fee income above was million for both the years ending december  and and  for the year ending asset quality as permitted by banking regulations  consumer loans and home equity loans past due days or more continue to accrue interest 
in addition  certain commercial and real estate loans that are more than days past due may be kept on an accruing status if the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
as a general rule  a commercial or real estate loan more than days past due with respect to principal or interest is classified as a nonaccrual loan 
income accruals are suspended on all nonaccrual loans and all previously accrued and uncollected interest is reversed against current income 
a loan remains on nonaccrual status until it becomes current with respect to principal and interest  when the loan is liquidated  or when the loan is determined to be uncollectible and is charged off against the allowance for loan losses 
nonperforming assets are comprised of nonperforming loans  nonperforming securities and other real estate owned oreo 
nonperforming loans consist of loans that are more than days past due but still accruing interest and nonaccrual loans 
oreo includes properties held by the bank as a result of foreclosure or by acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure 
as of december   nonperforming assets totaled million  an increase of  or  from the prior year end 
nonperforming assets represented of total assets for the year ending december  and for the year ending december  there was no oreo or nonperforming securities for the periods ended december  and december  the following table sets forth information regarding nonperforming assets held by the bank at the dates indicated

in the course of resolving nonperforming loans  the bank may choose to restructure the contractual terms of certain commercial and real estate loans 
terms may be modified to fit the ability of the borrower to repay in line with its current financial status 
it is the bank s policy to maintain restructured loans on nonaccrual status for approximately six months before management considers its return to accrual status 
at december   the bank had  of restructured loans 
at december   the bank had four potential problem loans not included in nonperforming loans with an outstanding balance of million 
real estate acquired by the bank through foreclosure proceedings or the acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure is classified as oreo 
when property is acquired  it is recorded at the lesser of the loan s remaining principal balance or the estimated fair value of the property acquired  less estimated costs to sell 
any loan balance in excess of the estimated fair value less estimated cost to sell on the date of transfer is charged to the allowance for loan losses on that date 
all costs incurred thereafter in maintaining the property  as well as subsequent declines in fair value are charged to non interest expense 
gross interest income that would have been recognized for the years ended december   and  if nonperforming loans at the respective dates had been performing in accordance with their original terms approximated   and  respectively 
the actual amount of interest that was collected on these loans during each of those periods and included in interest income was approximately   and  respectively 
a loan is considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the bank will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal or interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
factors considered by management in determining impairment include payment status  collateral value  and the probability of collecting scheduled principal and interest payments when due 
loans that experience insignificant payment delays and payment shortfalls generally are not classified as impaired 
management determines the significance of payment delays and payment shortfalls on a case by case basis  taking into consideration all of the circumstances surrounding the loan and the borrower  including the length of the delay  the reasons for the delay  the borrower s prior payment record  and the amount of the shortfall in relation to the principal and interest owed 
impairment is measured on a loan by loan basis for commercial  commercial real estate  and construction loans by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s obtainable market price  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans are collectively evaluated for impairment 
accordingly  the bank does not separately identify individual  consumer  or residential loans for impairment disclosures 
at december   impaired loans include all commercial real estate loans and commercial and industrial loans on nonaccrual status 
total impaired loans at december  and were million and million  respectively 
allowance for loan losses while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on increases in nonperforming loans  changes in economic conditions  or for other reasons 
various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the bank s allowance for loan losses 
federal reserve regulators examined the company in the first quarter of and the bank was most recently examined by the federal deposit insurance corporation  fdic  in the fourth quarter of no additional provision for loan losses was required as a result of these examinations 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level that management considers adequate to provide for potential loan losses based upon evaluation of known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
the allowance is increased by provisions for loan losses and by recoveries of loans previously charged off and reduced by loans charged off 
in  the bank established a separate credit quality discount as a reduction of the loan balances acquired from fleetboston financial 
this credit quality discount represents inherent losses in the acquired loan portfolio 
the level of credit quality discount was million at december  and million at december  including the credit quality discount  the total allowances for loan losses was million at december   compared to million at december  the following table summarizes changes in the allowance for loan losses and other selected statistics for the periods presented table summary of changes in the allowance for loan losses year ending december  dollars in thousands average total loans     allowance for loan losses  beginning of year   charged off loans commercial  real estate commercial real estate residential real estate construction consumer installment      consumer other total charged off loans     recoveries on loans previously charged off commercial real estate commercial real estate residential real estate construction consumer installment consumer other total recoveries    net loans charged off      provision for loan losses      allowance for loan losses  end of period    credit quality discount on acquired loans  total allowances for loan losses  end of year   net loans charged off as a percent of average total loans allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans allowance for loan losses as a percent of nonperforming loans total allowances for loan losses as a percent of total loans including credit quality discount total allowance for loan losses as a percent of nonperforming loans including credit quality discount net loans charged off as a percent of allowance for loan losses recoveries as a percent of charge offs the allowance for loan losses is allocated to various loan categories as part of the bank s process of evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
allocated allowances increased by approximately million to million at december  with increases shown in each of the various loan categories 
increased amounts of allowance allocated to the four major portfolio components real estate commercial  commercial industrial  real estate residential and consumer installment represented approximately of the total increase in allocated allowances from december  the increase in the amount of allowance allocated to the real estate commercial portfolio component is attributed to growth of portfolio balances 
balances outstanding in this loan category at december  increased by compared to balances outstanding at december  the increase in the amount of allowance allocated to the commercial industrial portfolio component is attributed to the re categorization of certain loans 
certain loans have been re categorized based upon the results of loan reviews conducted both internally and by third party loan review consultants 
loans that have been re categorized in a manner requiring increased amounts of allowance to be allocated represented approximately of balances outstanding in this category at december  the increase in the amount of allowance allocated to the real estate residential portfolio component is a direct result of growth in the residential mortgage and home equity subsets of this component of the loan portfolio 
outstanding balances at december  in each of these subcategories grew by and  respectively  and by combined as a whole  from december  the increase in the amount of allowance allocated to the consumer installment portfolio segment reflects a change in the mix of the subset of loan types that compose this segment 
the following table summarizes the allocation of the allowance for loan losses for the years indicated table summary of allocation of allowance for loan losses at december  allowance amount credit quality discount percent of loans in category to total loans allowance amount credit quality discount percent of loans in category to total loans allowance amount credit quality discount percent of loans in category to total loans allowance amount percent of loans in category to total loans allowance amount percent of loans in category to total loans dollars in thousands allocated allowance commercial industrial   real estate commercial   real estate construction   real estate residential consumer installment   consumer other imprecision allowance  na  na  na  na  na total allowance for loan losses   allocated allowance for loan losses are determined using both a formula based approach applied to groups of loans and an analysis of certain individual loans for impairment 
the formula based approach evaluates groups of loans to determine the allocation appropriate within each portfolio segment 
individual loans within the commercial industrial  real estate commercial and real estate construction loan portfolio segments are assigned internal risk ratings to group them with other loans possessing similar risk characteristics 
the level of allowance allocable to each group of risk rated loans is then determined by management applying a loss factor that estimates the amount of probable loss inherent in each category 
the assigned loss factor for each risk rating is a formula based assessment of historical loss data  portfolio characteristics  economic trends  overall market conditions  past experience and management s analysis of considerations of probable loan loss based on these factors 
a similar formula based approach  using a point in time credit grade distribution  was recently developed for the consumer installment segment of the loan portfolio and employed for the first time in this method was developed in response both to the significance of the balance and the seasoning of this segment of the portfolio which has allowed for a more analytical overview of its inherent risk characteristics 
this new method has been combined with subjective factors  which reflect changing environmental conditions in the consumer installment loan market 
the result of this analytical approach provided an allowance allocation for installment loans of million at december   compared with million at december  allocations for residential real estate and other consumer loan categories are principally determined by applying loss factors that represent management s estimate of probable or expected losses inherent in those categories 
in each segment  inherent losses are estimated  based on a formula based assessment of historical loss data  portfolio characteristics  economic trends  overall market conditions  past loan loss experience and management s considerations of probable loan loss based on these factors 
the other method used to allocate the allowances for loan losses entails the assignment of allowance amounts to individual loans on the basis of loan impairment 
certain loans are evaluated individually and are judged to be impaired when management believes it is probable that the bank will not collect all of the contractual interest and principal payments as scheduled in the loan agreement 
under this method loans are selected for evaluation based on a change in internal risk rating  occurrence of delinquency  loan classification or nonaccrual status 
a specific allowance amount is allocated to an individual loan when such loan has been deemed impaired and when the amount of a probable loss is able to be estimated on the basis of a 
fair value of collateral  b 
present value of anticipated future cash flows or c 
the loan s observable fair market price 
loans with a specific allowance and the amount of such allowance totaled  and  respectively  at december  and  and  respectively  at december  a portion of the allowance for loan loss is not allocated to any specific segment of the loan portfolio 
this non specific allowance is maintained for two primary reasons a 
there exists an inherent subjectivity and imprecision to the analytical processes employed and b 
the prevailing business environment  as it is affected by changing economic conditions and various external factors  may impact the portfolio in ways currently unforeseen 
moreover  management has identified certain risk factors  which could impact the degree of loss sustained within the portfolio 
these include a 
market risk factors  such as the effects of economic variability on the entire portfolio  and b 
unique portfolio risk factors that are inherent characteristics of the bank s loan portfolio 
market risk factors may consist of changes to general economic and business conditions that may impact the bank s loan portfolio customer base in terms of ability to repay and that may result in changes in value of underlying collateral 
unique portfolio risk factors may include industry concentration or covariant industry concentrations  geographic concentrations or trends that may exacerbate losses resulting from economic events which the bank may not be able to fully diversify out of its portfolio 
due to the imprecise nature of the loan loss estimation process and ever changing conditions  these risk attributes may not be adequately captured in data related to the formula based loan loss components used to determine allocations in the bank s analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
management  therefore  has established and maintains a non specific allowance for loan losses 
the amount of this measurement imprecision allocation was million at december   compared to million at december  management increased the measurement imprecision allocation primarily based on concerns over how the overall weakening of the national economy may affect borrowers in its loan portfolio 
through the fiscal year ending december   the general state of the us economy has exhibited well publicized weaknesses such as lackluster growth and rising rates of unemployment 
national economic conditions notwithstanding  the reported slowdown of economic activity has not yet had a significant effect on the overall credit quality or incidence of default within the bank s loan portfolio through the year ended december  management  nonetheless  increased the measurement imprecision allocation of the loan loss allowance by million  as of december  based upon its belief that some of the bank s customer base may lag behind larger national firms with respect to the effects of a recession 
as of december   the allowance for loan losses totaled million as compared to million at december  based on the processes described above  management believes that the level of the allowance for possible loan losses at december  is adequate 
the credit quality discount was million and million at december  and  respectively
