item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business summary we are a real estate investment trust  or reit  and own a portfolio of upscale  full service hotels and resorts in the united states and canada 
our portfolio is diversified by franchise and brand affiliations 
as of december   we owned hotels  with  rooms  all of which were leased by our taxable subsidiaries and managed by interstate hotels resorts interstate hotels  which was created on july  through the merger of meristar hotels resorts  inc and interstate hotels corporation 
we share our chief executive officer and chairman of the board  paul w 
whetsell  and two other board members with interstate hotels 
in addition  we are party to an intercompany agreement with interstate hotels that governs a number of aspects of our relationship 
our taxable subsidiaries pay a base management fee to interstate hotels for each property managed equal to of total hotel revenue  plus incentive payments based on meeting performance thresholds that could total up to an additional of total hotel revenue 
the management agreements generally have initial terms of years with three renewal periods of five years each  except for three management agreements which have initial terms of one year each and renew annually thereafter 
results overview revenues declined to million in compared to  million in our results continue to reflect a slowed economy  which has caused substantial declines in business and leisure travel demand nationwide 
both business and leisure travel continue to be negatively affected by the aftermath of the september  terrorist attacks and threats of international hostilities and instability 
business transient travelers have not yet returned in prior volumes to our properties and in their absence  we have focused our efforts on our group and contract business 
our achieved average daily rate is under continued pressure as a result of the decrease in demand and general lack of pricing power 
hotel operating expenses decreased to million in from million in as a result of decreased occupancy and cost control measures implemented during late we will continue to work with interstate hotels to focus on identifying revenue enhancement opportunities as well as cost reduction and control measures at our hotels 
other operating expenses increased to million in from million in primarily resulting from an asset impairment charge of million in versus an asset impairment charge in of million 
both are more fully described in the results of operations section below 
since january   our revenues have been derived from the operations of our hospitality properties  including room  food and beverage revenues  as well as from our leases of office  retail and parking rentals 
operating costs include direct costs to run our hotels  management fees to interstate hotels to manage our properties  depreciation of our properties  as well as sales  marketing and general and administrative costs 
our expenses also include interest on our debt and minority interest allocations  which represent the allocation of income to outside investors for properties that are not wholly owned 
prior to january   we earned lease revenue from the lease of our hotel operating properties 
our expenses included depreciation of our properties  and related property tax expense  general and administrative costs  as well as interest on our debt and minority interest allocations 
results of operations the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
require that current and prior period operating results of any asset that has been classified as held for sale or has been disposed of on or after january   including any gain or loss recognized on the sale  be recorded as discontinued operations 
accordingly  we have reclassified all prior periods presented to conform to this provision 
see footnote  dispositions and acquisitions  included in item of this annual report on form k for further information regarding the amounts reclassified 
year ended december  compared with the year ended december  the following table provides our hotels operating statistics on a comparable hotel basis for the years ended december comparable hotels are those that were owned for substantially all of both years change revenue per available room average daily rate occupancy the slowing united states economy has had a significant negative effect on our hotel operations  evidenced by a sharp reduction in transient business travel 
this is reflected in the reduction in average daily rate and the reduction in occupancy in compared to we have shifted our marketing efforts towards lower rated group and contract business in most markets in order to maintain a base level of occupancy in our properties 
due to the short booking window for most business  including our group and contract customers  we anticipate being able to shift our mix of business toward more business transient customers when the economy and corporate profits strengthen  bringing renewed strength to this vital customer segment 
revenues 
total revenue from continuing operations decreased million to million in from  million in  primarily due to a million decrease in room revenue attributable to a decrease in average daily rate and occupancy 
the decrease in occupancy also contributed to an million decrease in food and beverage revenue and a million decrease in other operating departments  including telephone and conference services 
we also had a million decrease in lease revenue following the termination of our hotel leases with prime hospitality corporation in we replaced these leases with management contracts with interstate hotels 
operating expenses 
total operating expenses increased a net million to million in compared to million in an increase in other operating expenses of million was partially offset by a million reduction in hotel operating expenses 
hotel operating expenses decreased from million in to million in due primarily to reductions in room expense of million and food and beverage costs of million 
these decreases resulted directly from the decrease in occupancy previously discussed 
other operating expenses increased to million in from million in  described in greater detail  as follows administrative and general expenses 
administrative and general expenses increased million during the year  due primarily to an increase in our total marketing costs 
this increase can be mainly attributed to the addition of marketing personnel to focus our efforts on the group and contract business during the year 
property operating costs 
our property operating costs consist primarily of repairs and maintenance  energy  franchise and management costs 
our property operating costs decreased million during the year 
this is primarily due to a million decrease in franchise fees and a million decrease in management fees directly resulting from our decrease in revenues 
our energy costs also decreased million primarily due to reduced occupancy 
we have begun to see increases in our energy costs in due to the civil disruptions in venezuela and concerns regarding the persian gulf war  as well as an unusually cold winter in the northeastern united states 
we expect this cost trend to continue until such time as concerns over a potential gulf war subside 
property taxes  insurance and other 
these costs decreased million due primarily to a million reduction in property taxes  partially offset by a million increase in property and terrorism insurance premiums in property taxes decreased due to favorable resolution of certain appeals  as well as a reduction in tax assessed values of certain properties 
our total annual property and casualty insurance premiums are approximately million 
our insurance programs renew in july  and we anticipate a substantial increase although pricing will be dictated by market conditions at that time  which have not completely stabilized since the september  terrorist attacks 
companies in a number of industry segments  particularly the travel and leisure industry  are experiencing increases in premiums and reductions in coverage upon renewal of their insurance policies  due to the dramatic effect the september  terrorist attacks had on the insurance and reinsurance industries 
some entities have experienced an inability to obtain insurance 
our manager  interstate hotels  is responsible for securing all of our insurance coverage 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by million 
depreciation expense increased million due to the purchase of replacement corporate office computer equipment 
amortization expense increased million due to the amortization of deferred financing fees related to the december and february issuance of our senior secured notes 
significant charges 
we incurred the following significant charges in a million loss on asset impairments  a million write down of our note receivable with interstate hotels due to the settlement agreement related to their early repayment of the note  a million loss on fair value of non hedging derivatives due to the repayment of debt that was originally hedged  a million expense for non hedging derivatives due to our swap agreements being converted to non hedging derivatives  million of costs related to the formal separation of management functions from interstate hotels  and a million write off of deferred costs due to the reduction in our borrowing capacity on our revolving credit agreement in march and the termination of our credit facility in october we also incurred several significant charges in  as follows a million loss on asset impairments  million in swap termination fees  a million expense for non hedging derivatives due to our swap agreements being converted to non hedging derivatives  million of transaction costs  expensed immediately when our proposed merger with felcor lodging trust inc was terminated by both parties  a million write down of our investment in sts hotel net  million of costs to terminate our leases with prime hospitality corporation  and a million charge related to a restructuring at our corporate headquarters 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million to million in compared to million in due primarily to higher interest rates 
we issued million of senior unsecured notes in december and million in february at fixed rates of interest greater than the variable rate on the debt that was repaid from the proceeds of the issuance 
as of december   all of our debt carried fixed rates of interest 
discontinued operations and loss on sale of assets 
during  we sold five hotels in separate transactions and received million in cash 
this resulted in a combined loss of million  net of tax 
in january  we completed the sale of one hotel  classified as held for sale at december  we recognized an impairment loss on this asset of million  net of tax  which is included in discontinued operations 
we classified million  net of tax  of income from these six hotels operations as discontinued in  and million  net of tax  of losses from their operations as discontinued in losses in included an impairment charge of million  net of tax 
in  we sold two hotels in separate transactions and received million in cash 
this resulted in losses on the sales of million 
these losses  as well as the operating results of these hotels  were included in continuing operations  as the provisions of sfas no 
requiring the presentation of such results in discontinued operations applies only to assets classified as held for sale or disposed of on or after january  extraordinary items 
in  we repaid million of term loans under our revolving credit facility  resulting in an extraordinary loss of million  net of tax  from the write off of deferred financing costs related to those term loans 
we will adopt the provisions of sfas no 
beginning on january  see new accounting pronouncements discussion below for further details 
certain rescission provisions require that all gains and losses from extinguishments of debt be classified as extraordinary only if the gains and losses are from unusual or infrequent transactions 
prior period amounts that do not meet this definition are required to be reclassified as an operational expense 
our prior period extraordinary items will be reclassified as operational expenses during  and in the future we expect any gains and losses from the extinguishment of our debt to be classified as operational 
year ended december  compared with the year ended december  until january   interstate hotels leased substantially all of our hotels from us 
under the leases  interstate hotels assumed all of the operating risks and rewards of these hotels and paid us a percentage of each hotel s revenue under the lease agreements 
therefore  for financial statement purposes through december   interstate hotels recorded all of the operating revenues and expenses of the hotels in its statements of operations  and we recorded lease revenue earned under the lease agreements in our statement of operations 
effective january   interstate hotels assigned the hotel leases to our wholly owned  taxable reit subsidiaries  and our taxable reit subsidiaries entered into management agreements with interstate hotels to manage the hotels 
for consolidated financial statement purposes  beginning january   we recorded all of the revenues and expenses of the hotels in our statements of operations  including the management fee paid to interstate hotels 
our total revenues and total operating expenses increased million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in as described in the preceding paragraph  the significant increases resulted from recording our hotels operating revenue and expenses in our consolidated financial statements effective january   while we only recorded lease revenue in as a result  our operating results for the year ended december  are not directly comparable to the same period in we therefore compare our historical results of operations with our pro forma results of operations  assuming that the reit modernization act had been enacted on january  the reit modernization act is discussed in greater detail in item business contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
for comparative purposes  the following shows the results for the year ended december  on a pro forma basis assuming the leases with interstate hotels were converted to management contracts on january  pro forma in thousands revenue hotel operating expenses other operating expenses total operating expenses interest expense  net minority interests loss gain on sale of assets income tax benefit expense discontinued operations  net of tax net loss income before extraordinary item extraordinary loss gain on early extinguishment of debt  net of tax net loss income the following table provides our hotels operating statistics on a comparable hotel basis for the years ended december pro forma change revenue per available room average daily rate occupancy overall  disruptions in business and leisure travel patterns and travel safety concerns due to the terrorist attacks on september   coupled with the slowing united states economy  had a significant negative effect on our hotels during the second half of the events were marked by sharp reductions in business and leisure travel 
this contributed to the reduction in revenue per available room and the reduction in occupancy for compared to these reductions became more pronounced during the third and fourth quarters of revenues 
total revenue decreased million to  million in from  million in  primarily due to a million decrease in room revenue attributable to a decrease in average daily rate and occupancy 
the decrease in occupancy also contributed to a million decrease in food and beverage revenue 
we also had a million decrease in lease revenue due to a lesser number of hotels leased to prime hospitality corporation in as compared to operating expenses 
total operating expenses increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million in this is mainly attributable to a million increase in other operating expenses from million in to million in this increase resulted primarily from the following significant charges taken during a million loss on asset impairments  million in swap termination fees  a million expense for non hedging derivatives due to our swap agreements being converted to non hedging derivatives  million of transaction costs  expensed immediately when our proposed merger with felcor lodging trust inc was terminated by both parties  a million write down of our investment in sts hotel net  million of costs to terminate our leases with prime hospitality corporation  and a million charge related to a restructuring at our corporate headquarters 
the increase noted above was partially offset by a million decrease in hotel operating expenses from million in to million in  attributable mainly to a reduction in room expenses of million  and food and beverage costs of million 
these decreases stemmed directly from the decrease in occupancy previously noted 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in due primarily to the issuance of million of senior unsecured notes in january discontinued operations and loss on sale of assets 
during  we sold five hotels and in january  we sold a hotel classified as held for sale at december  as required by sfas no 
 we classified losses on the hotels operations of million  net of tax  as discontinued  and million  net of tax  of income from their operations in as discontinued 
losses in included an impairment charge of million  net of tax 
in  we sold two hotels in separate transactions and received million in cash 
this resulted in a loss on the sales of million 
in  we sold three hotels in separate transactions and received million in cash  resulting in a gain on the sales of million 
the gain or loss recognized on these sales  as well as the operating results of these hotels  were included in continuing operations  as the provisions of sfas no 
requiring the presentation of such results as discontinued operations applies to only those assets classified as held for sale or disposed of on or after january  extraordinary items 
in  we repaid million of term loans under our revolving credit facility  resulting in an extraordinary loss of million  net of tax  from the write off of deferred financing costs related to those term loans 
in  we repurchased million of our convertible notes at a discount  resulting in an extraordinary gain of million  net of tax 
funds from operations and ebitda the national association of real estate investment trusts  or nareit  defines funds from operations  or ffo  as net income computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of properties  plus depreciation and amortization  and after comparable adjustments for our portion of these items related to unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
extraordinary items as defined by gaap are excluded from the calculation of ffo 
ebitda represents consolidated earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
we consider ffo and ebitda to be indicative measures of our operating performance due to the significance of our long lived assets  and because such data is considered useful by the investment community to better understand our results  and can be used to measure our ability to service debt  fund capital expenditures  and expand our business 
ffo may include funds that may not be available for our discretionary use due to functional requirements to conserve funds for capital expenditures and property acquisitions  or for other commitments and uncertainties 
ffo and ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net income  operating profit  cash from operations  or any other operating or liquidity performance measure prescribed by gaap 
although ffo and ebitda are considered standard benchmarks utilized by the investment community  our ffo and ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
comparative ffo we use comparative ffo as a measure of our performance 
we define comparative ffo as nareit s definition as described above  adjusted for significant or unusual items and the effect of non hedging derivatives 
the following reconciles our gaap loss before extraordinary items to comparative ffo on a diluted basis for the years ended december in thousands pro forma loss income before extraordinary items loss on asset impairments  net of minority interests loss gain on sold assets  net of taxes minority interest to common op unit holders interest on convertible debt a   hotel depreciation and amortization deferred cost of sale of asset ffo interest rate swaps significant unusual items  net of minority interests and income taxes write down of note receivable from interstate hotels restructuring and organization costs b write off of deferred financing costs loss on fair value of non hedging derivatives swap termination costs write down of investment in sts hotel net felcor merger costs costs to terminate leases with prime hospitality corporation comparative ffo a for the year ended december   assumed conversion of the notes was anti dilutive 
as such  interest on the notes was excluded from the calculation of ffo 
b in  we incurred million of costs related to the formal separation of management functions from interstate hotels 
in  we incurred a restructuring charge of million in connection with operational changes at our corporate headquarters 
refer to footnote  separation and restructuring charges  in item included elsewhere in the annual report on form k for further details 
the costs for both years are included in administrative and general expenses on our income statement 
we excluded the costs from our comparative ffo because we consider them to be unusual in nature 
comparative ebitda comparative ebitda includes the operations from the assets included in discontinued operations  adjusted for non recurring items

our principal uses of cash include the funding of working capital obligations  debt service  and investments in hotels primarily capital projects currently  and may include in the future the repurchase of our debt in the open market 
factors that may influence our liquidity include factors that affect our results of operations  including general economic conditions  demand for business and leisure travel  public concerns about travel safety related primarily to terrorism and concern over a war with iraq and related concerns  and other operating risks described under the caption  risk factors operating risks in item of this annual report on form k  factors that affect our access to bank financing and the capital markets  including operational risks  high leverage  interest rate fluctuations  and other risks described under the caption risk factors financing risks in item of this annual report on form k  and other factors described under the caption  cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements in this annual report on form k 
we believe we have sufficient free cash flow currently  and we expect to have adequate cash flow during the next twelve months in order to fund our operations  capital commitments and debt service obligations 
our current and future liquidity is  however  greatly dependent upon our operating results  which are driven largely by overall economic conditions  and since september  have been heavily impacted by geopolitical concerns 
if general economic conditions are significantly worse than we expect for an extended period  this will likely have a negative effect on our projections of available cash flow and liquidity 
we have  however  taken steps to strengthen our balance sheet and to maintain financial flexibility and liquidity 
we sold five non core assets in for approximately million 
we ended the year with a cash balance of approximately million  of which million was unrestricted 
in january  we sold another non core hotel asset for approximately million and received million in cash for settlement of our note receivable with interstate hotels 
as of march   we held approximately million in unrestricted cash 
we intend to carry balances of similar amounts  or slightly higher  on our balance sheet for the foreseeable future  as we believe this cash reserve should be adequate to protect us from a potential downturn in our business 
we are also currently actively marketing or expect to bring to market in the near future  a total of non core assets  for expected proceeds of approximately million to million 
our ability to realize these estimated proceeds is  however  dependent upon finding qualified buyers willing to pay a purchase price that we consider reasonable 
subject to the limits and restrictions imposed on us by our borrowing arrangements  we are currently able to utilize any proceeds from the sale of assets to fund our ongoing operations  invest in capital expenditures and repay our debt as it comes due 
see long term debt section below for a discussion of such restrictions 
to reduce the overall amount and cost of our debt  we will consider opportunities to repurchase some of our current outstanding debt 
any such transactions  however  are subject to the limits and restrictions imposed by our borrowing arrangements 
see long term debt section below for a discussion of such restrictions 
sources and uses of cash our operating results and the amount of cash generated by our hotel operations have been negatively impacted by the events of september   the continuing sluggish economy  and the threat of further terrorist attacks 
we generated million of cash from operations during compared to million in and million in included in our operating results is the preferred return on our preferred investment in meristar investment partners or mip 
as of december   approximately million of cumulative preferred returns remained unpaid due to restrictions placed on mip by its existing bank covenants  which require excess cash flow to be applied to principal amortization rather than being distributed to equity holders 
we evaluate the collectibility of our preferred return based on the underlying value of the hotel properties and our preference to distributions 
on march   mip completed a refinancing of its long term debt  which allows the release of excess cash flow to pay our preferred return currently 
we expect to begin receiving distributions representing payments of our current return during the second quarter of in the future  we expect that our cumulative unpaid preferred returns will be paid from excess cash flow above our current return and from potential disposition proceeds in excess of debt allocated to individual assets 
given the current economic environment  we do not expect the partnership s operations to provide adequate cash flow in the near term for significant repayments of our cumulative unpaid preferred returns 
our investing activities provided a net million of cash during  resulting primarily from million of proceeds from the sale of five hotels  partially offset by million of hotel capital expenditures including million of capitalized interest  and million of advances to interstate hotels 
we used million of cash in financing activities during  primarily for the net repayment of million of our long term debt obligations and million in additional deferred financing costs related to our new debt facilities 
we must distribute to stockholders at least of our reit taxable income  excluding net capital gains  to preserve the favorable tax treatment accorded to reits under the internal revenue code 
the payment of dividends is restricted under our senior unsecured notes if our fixed charge coverage ratio falls below to  except that the indenture permits us to pay dividends necessary to maintain our status as a reit 
under certain circumstances  we may be required to make distributions in excess of available cash in order to meet the internal revenue code requirements 
in that event  we would seek to borrow additional funds or sell additional non core assets  or both  to the extent necessary to obtain cash sufficient to make the dividends required to retain our qualification as a reit 
any future distributions will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be based on factors including  but not limited to  our operating results  restrictions imposed by our borrowing agreements  capital expenditure requirements  the economic outlook  and the internal revenue service dividend payout requirements for reits 
the timing and amount of any future distributions is dependent upon these factors  and we cannot provide assurance of the amounts of any such distributions that we may make in the future 
at current operating levels  we do not expect to be able to pay a dividend in long term debt convertible notes 
as of december   we had outstanding million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due in we are currently actively exploring a variety of sources to repay these securities 
under the indentures related to our million of senior unsecured notes and our million of senior subordinated unsecured notes  prepayment of our convertible subordinated notes prior to maturity is prohibited as long as our fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined  is less than to at the end of  such ratio was to and  therefore  under these circumstances  we can only repay these securities at maturity our indentures permit such repayment at maturity 
we do not currently expect this ratio to improve to a level which would permit repayment of the convertible notes prior to their maturity 
among the sources of repayment of these securities which are currently under active consideration  all of which are permitted under our indentures  are our available cash flow  the proceeds of borrowings on a non recourse basis  with such borrowings secured by certain of our hotel properties  borrowing under our million general debt basket under our indentures  cmbs or other secured borrowings through a special purpose  unrestricted subsidiary  our indentures permit us to fund such a subsidiary with assets equal to up to of our consolidated net tangible assets approximately million at december   the proceeds of a pari passu refinancing of our convertible subordinated notes  or a combination of the above 
our ability to issue secured debt is enhanced by the fact that our hotel portfolio contains unencumbered properties out of our total current portfolio of hotels  and only of these assets are subject to ground leases 
our ability to incur secured debt is generally limited by tests in our senior note indentures requiring us to maintain certain levels of unencumbered assets 
however  we do not believe that these requirements will prevent us from accessing any of the above sources of secured financing at the convertible notes maturity in october new credit facility 
on october   we entered into a new three year million senior revolving credit facility  secured by our equity interests in most of our subsidiaries 
the initial interest rate is libor plus basis points 
as of december   there were no outstanding borrowings on this facility 
this facility contains customary compliance measures we must meet in order to borrow on the facility  which became more stringent on a quarterly basis beginning in the first quarter of the sale of two hotels during the fourth quarter of and one in january  as well as the settlement of our note receivable with interstate hotels  impacted our leverage covenant due to the loss of trailing month ebitda as defined in the credit agreement on a pro forma basis 
while we cannot currently borrow under the facility  we have obtained a waiver of compliance with this leverage covenant from our lending group through may  we do not expect this compliance measurement to have a material impact on our operations as we do not anticipate the need to draw on this facility during we intend to either negotiate an amendment to this facility to maintain our future compliance until such time as we apply our unrestricted cash to reduce our leverage  or we may terminate the facility 
senior unsecured notes 
in february  we issued an additional million million  net of discount and related fees aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due we used the proceeds from the issuance of these notes to repay approximately million of the outstanding balance under our previous credit facility 
as of december   we had million of aggregate principal of these notes outstanding 
these notes contain various restrictive incurrence covenants  limiting our ability to transact certain business activities  including additional borrowings  if specific financial thresholds are not achieved 
one of those thresholds is maintaining a to fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the indentures  fixed charges only include interest on debt obligations and preferred equity 
as of december   our fixed charge coverage ratio was to  and therefore we were not able to enter into certain transactions 
these limitations include the repurchase of our stock  the issuance of any preferred stock  the payment of dividends unless required to maintain our status as a reit  the incurrence of any additional debt  or the repayment of outstanding debt before it comes due 
there are certain exceptions  or carve out  features with respect to the incurrence of additional debt and early repayment of debt features in the indentures 
senior subordinated notes 
we completed in the offering of million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due the related indenture contains various restrictive covenants  which are similar to those in our senior unsecured notes 
in  we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due under an indenture substantially similar to that governing the notes 
these notes are unsecured obligations and provide for semi annual payments of interest each february and august secured facility 
we completed this million  year non recourse financing during the facility is secured by a portfolio of hotels and contains standard provisions that require the servicer to maintain in escrow cash balances for certain items such as property taxes and funding of capital expenditures 
in addition  the facility contains a provision that requires our mortgage servicer to retain in escrow the excess cash from the encumbered hotels after payment of debt service excess cash  if net hotel operating income after payment of ff e reserves and franchise fees noi for the trailing twelve months declines below million 
this provision was triggered in october and will be effective until the hotels generate the minimum cash flow required for two consecutive quarters  at which time the cash being held in escrow will be released to us 
approximately million of cash was held in escrow under this provision as of december  additional amounts continue to be held in escrow 
the security agreement permits us to substitute unleveraged properties into the portfolio in place of existing properties in order to increase the noi to a level at which the portfolio will meet this requirement 
we have begun discussions with the servicer regarding this substitution and expect to be able to do so  thus resulting in the release of any excess cash held in escrow 
implementation of this solution is subject to rating agency approval and qualification for real estate mortgage investment conduit purposes 
there can be no assurance that the hotels will reach the minimum cash flow in the future 
the security agreement also permits us to withdraw the cash held in escrow for funding of capital expenditures on the encumbered properties 
subsequent to year end  through march   the servicer had held million of additional funds in escrow 
use of asset sales proceeds as discussed elsewhere  one of our key short term strategies is to sell selected non core assets  many of which were acquired as part of a portfolio 
these non core assets generally possess one or more of the following characteristics limited future growth potential  secondary market location  secondary brand affiliation  higher than average capital expenditure requirements  or our portfolio is over weighted in the market 
we believe that these asset sale transactions will have the following benefits improve the overall quality of the hotel assets remaining in our portfolio  enhance the ability of our portfolio to perform well in all cycles of the economy  enhance future growth prospects when strength returns to the economy  reduce future capital requirements on a relative basis  and reduce our leverage and requirements on our liquidity resources 
our plan is to monitor our operations and developments in the economic and geopolitical environment 
to the extent we complete additional asset dispositions  and we believe that our liquidity levels are appropriate  we will consider applying proceeds from those dispositions to repurchase debt and reinvest in our core assets 
assets currently being marketed we continue to focus on a deleveraging strategy  including the expansion of our program of selling non core assets 
initially  we intend to retain the proceeds from any asset sales for additional liquidity 
to the extent we complete additional asset dispositions  and we believe that our liquidity levels are appropriate  we will consider applying proceeds from asset sales to repurchase debt and reinvest in our core assets 
we sold five hotels in and one hotel in january as of february   we were actively marketing eight additional assets as part of our non core asset disposition plan 
subsequently  based on our decision to raise additional cash to reduce our overall leverage and provide additional capital for reinvestment in our core holdings  we changed our expectation about our holding period for certain other hotels 
we plan to market another eight hotels  which will increase the number of marketed assets to sixteen 
based on our expected proceeds of approximately million to million  we will record an impairment charge in the first quarter of in an expected range of million to million 
our ability to realize these estimated proceeds is  however  dependent upon finding qualified buyers willing to pay a purchase price that we consider reasonable 
in addition  we are frequently approached by potential buyers interested in other assets that we might consider selling and have recently engaged in discussions with some of those potential buyers of hotel assets  both on an individual and a portfolio basis 
any such portfolio may include both core and non core assets  if the disposition arrangement would be beneficial to shareholder value 
however  there can be no assurance that any such transactions will be concluded 
any additional sales of assets under these scenarios may result in additional impairment charges in future periods  if and when the assets are actively marketed 
while we always consider any opportunities that may improve our financial condition or results of operations  we have not committed to the disposition of any of these other assets at this time 
as such  we are not able at this time to estimate the timing or the amount of any impairment charges that might result 
we are aided in our disposition program by the fact that we can terminate any management agreement of any hotel we sell  in some cases  subject to the payment of a fee  as well as the fact that of our assets are unencumbered and only of those assets are subject to ground leases 
capital resources we make ongoing capital expenditures in order to keep our hotels competitive in their markets and to comply with franchise obligations  as described further in operating risks the potential adverse impact of our failure to meet the requirements contained in our franchise and licensing agreements included in item risk factors of this annual report on form k 
we fund our capital expenditures primarily from cash generated from operations and existing cash on hand  but may also use proceeds from the sales of non core assets to provide capital for renovation work 
we invested approximately of total hotel revenues for ongoing capital expenditures during  or million including million of capitalized interest  and we anticipate investing million to million on capital expenditure programs in these ongoing programs will include room and facilities refurbishments  renovations  and furniture and equipment replacements 
we will be shifting a portion of our planned capital expenditures to the second half of the year due to the current sluggish economy and uncertainty in the current economic operating environment 
if operating conditions warrant  we may defer elements of our capital expenditure program to we believe cash on hand and cash generated by operations will be sufficient to fund our existing working capital requirements  ongoing capital expenditures  and debt service requirements 
our future capital decisions will also be made in response to specific acquisition and or investment opportunities  depending on conditions in the capital and or other financial markets 
other financial information critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all wholly owned and majority owned subsidiaries 
preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to the impairment of long lived assets and the recording of certain accrued liabilities 
some of our estimates are material to the financial statements 
these estimates are therefore particularly sensitive as future events could cause the actual results to be significantly different from our estimates 
our critical accounting policies include the accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and the classification of properties as held for sale 
our hotel properties generally fall into two categories  held for use and held for sale 
our held for use properties may include those that we are actively marketing 
until such time as our criteria for held for sale are met  as described below in further detail  we maintain classification as an operational asset 
at the time we determine an asset to meet the criteria noted below  we reclassify the asset and its operations to discontinued operations 
both categories are subject to an impairment analysis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  on january  sfas no 
requires the current and prior period operating results of any asset that has been classified as held for sale or had been disposed of on or after january  and where we have no continuing involvement  including any gain or loss recognized  to be recorded as discontinued operations 
the provisions of sfas no 
also require that whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a long lived asset may be impaired  we perform an analysis to determine the recoverability of the asset s carrying value 
we make estimates of the undiscounted cash flows from the expected future operations of the asset  or in the case of an asset actively being marketed but not yet held for sale  we look at a range of expected sale prices 
if the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from these estimates of cash flows  we write down the asset to estimated fair value and recognize an impairment loss 
any impairment losses we recognize on assets held for use are recorded as operating expenses 
we record any impairment losses on assets held for sale as a component of discontinued operations 
based on current economic conditions and our continuing forecast and outlooks for future periods  we may be required in future periods to recognize additional impairment charges if circumstances indicate at that time that the carrying value of the assets may be impaired 
classification of properties as held for sale real estate companies have differing standards with respect to which properties may be classified as held for sale 
we classify the properties we are actively marketing as held for sale once all of the following conditions are met our board has approved the sale  we have a fully executed agreement with a qualified buyer which provides for no significant outstanding or continuing obligations with the property after sale  and we have a significant non refundable deposit 
we carry properties held for sale at the lower of their carrying values or estimated fair values less costs to sell 
we cease depreciation at the time the asset is classified as held for sale 
if material to our total portfolio  we segregate the held for sale properties on our consolidated balance sheet 
we also reclassify the operating results of properties held for sale as discontinued operations for all periods presented

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our policy is to manage interest rates through the use of a combination of fixed and variable rate debt 
our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows 
to achieve our objectives  we borrow at a combination of fixed and variable rates  and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
we only enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for cash flow hedging purposes 
we do not engage in speculative transactions 
as of december   all of our outstanding debt carried fixed rates of interest  as follows average expected maturity fixed rate interest rate thereafter total fair value at our million senior revolving credit facility is our only variable rate debt 
as of december   we had no outstanding borrowings under this facility  and we do not anticipate the need to draw on it during upon the issuance in february of million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due  we reduced the borrowings under our previous senior secured credit facility by million 
as a result of this financing  we re designated two swap agreements as non hedging derivatives 
these swap agreements had notional principal amounts of approximately million and were originally designated to hedge variable rate borrowings under our senior secured credit facility that were repaid 
we recognized a million loss when this amount was transferred out of accumulated other comprehensive income because the debt being hedged was repaid 
the swap agreements expire between april and july these swap agreements are currently being marked to market through operations 
for the years ended december  and  we have made cash payments on these swaps of approximately million and million  respectively 
these cash payments are expensed in our statement of operations 
as of december   the day libor was 
if libor remains at that rate through july  we would make additional cash payments of approximately million 
if libor increases or decreases by basis points during this same period  our payments would decrease or increase by approximately million 
our canadian operations were not material to our consolidated financial position as of december  and  or our consolidated results of operations and cash flows for each of the years in the three year period ended december  accordingly  we were not subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risk from the effects that exchange rate movements of foreign currencies would have on our future costs or on our future cash flows we would receive from our foreign subsidiaries 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material to our results of operations for the same periods 
to date  we have not entered into any significant foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
