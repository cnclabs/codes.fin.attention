item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis addresses changes in devon s financial condition and results of operations during the three year period of through reference is made to item selected financial data and item financial statements and supplementary data 
overview on january   devon completed its acquisition of mitchell energy development corp 
mitchell 
under the terms of this merger  devon issued approximately million shares of devon common stock and paid billion in cash to the mitchell stockholders 
the cash portion of the acquisition was funded from borrowings under a billion senior unsecured term loan credit facility 
the mitchell merger added approximately million boe to devon s proved reserves 
following the mitchell merger announcement in august  devon announced on september   that it had entered into an agreement to acquire anderson exploration ltd 
anderson for approximately billion in cash 
this acquisition closed on october   and therefore had an impact on devon s results for the last two and one half months of the anderson acquisition added approximately million boe to devon s proved reserves 
to fund the cash portions of these two acquisitions  as well as to pay related transaction costs and retire certain long term debt assumed from mitchell and anderson  devon entered into long term debt agreements in october that totaled billion 
half of this total consisted of billion of notes and debentures issued on october  of this total  billion bears interest at and matures in september the remaining billion bears interest at and matures in september the remaining billion of the billion of long term debt is in the form of a credit facility that bears interest at floating rates 
as of december   billion of the original billion balance had been retired 
the primary sources of the repayments were the issuance of billion of debt securities  of which billion was used to pay down debt  and billion from the sale of certain oil and gas properties  of which billion was used to pay down debt 
as of december   the balance outstanding under the term loan credit facility was billion at an average rate of 
principal payments due on this debt are billion in april and billion in october the mitchell and anderson acquisitions followed another significant acquisition 
in august  devon closed its merger with santa fe snyder corporation 
this transaction added approximately million boe to devon s proved reserves 
in addition to the mergers and acquisitions  devon s exploration and development efforts have also been significant contributors to devon s growth 
in  devon spent billion in its exploration  drilling and development efforts 
these costs included drilling  wells  of which  were completed as producers 
in and  devon spent an aggregate of billion in its exploration  drilling and development efforts 
these costs included drilling  wells  of which  were completed as producers 
the following statistics illustrate the effects that devon s mergers and acquisitions and its drilling and development activities have had on operations during the last three years 
this data compares devon s results to those of for devon combined with santa fe snyder  which was acquired in a merger accounted for under the pooling of interests method 
such comparison yields the following fluctuations proved reserves increased million boe  or 
combined oil  gas and ngl production increased million boe  or 
total revenues increased billion  or 
net cash provided by operating activities increased million  or 
during  devon marked its th anniversary as a public company 
while devon has consistently increased production over this year period  volatility in oil  gas and ngl prices has resulted in considerable variability in earnings and cash flows 
prices for oil  natural gas and ngls are determined primarily by market conditions 
market conditions for these products have been  and will continue to be  influenced by regional and worldwide economic activity  weather and other factors that are beyond devon s control 
devon s future earnings and cash flows will continue to depend on market conditions 
like all oil and gas exploration and production companies  devon faces the challenge of natural production decline 
as initial pressures are depleted  oil and gas production from a given well naturally decreases 
thus  an oil and gas exploration and production company depletes part of its asset base with each unit of oil or gas it produces 
historically  devon has been able to overcome this natural decline by adding  through drilling and acquisitions  more reserves than it produces 
devon s future growth  if any  will depend on its ability to continue to add reserves in excess of production 
because oil  gas and ngl prices are influenced by many factors outside of its control  devon s management has focused its efforts on increasing oil and gas reserves and production and controlling expenses 
over its year history as a public company  devon has been able to reduce its controllable operating costs per unit of production 
devon s future earnings and cash flows are dependent on its ability to continue to contain operating costs at levels that allow for profitable production 
results of operations revenues changes in oil  gas and ngl production  prices and revenues from to are shown in the following tables

following is a comparison of devon s average prices with and without the effect of hedges for each of the last three years 
with hedges without hedges oil per bbl gas per mcf ngls per bbl oil  gas and ngls per boe oil revenues vs 
oil revenues increased million in an increase in production of million barrels caused oil revenues to increase by million 
the anderson and mitchell acquisitions accounted for million barrels of increased production 
this was partially offset by the effect of divestitures  which reduced production by million barrels 
a per barrel increase in the average oil price in accounted for the remaining million of increased oil revenues 
vs 
oil revenues decreased million in a per barrel decrease in s average price caused revenues to drop by million 
a decrease in production of one million barrels caused oil revenues to decrease by an additional million 
the october anderson merger accounted for three million barrels of production 
however  oil production from devon s other properties declined four million barrels 
this reduction was primarily the result of domestic and international properties which were sold prior to but whose production was included in prior to the sales 
gas revenues vs 
gas revenues increased million in an increase in production of bcf caused gas revenues to increase by billion 
the anderson and mitchell acquisitions accounted for bcf of increased production 
this was partially offset by the effect of divestitures  which reduced production by bcf  and by natural declines in production 
the effects of the net production increase were partially offset by a per mcf decrease in the average gas price in vs 
gas revenues increased million in of this total increase  million was due to a bcf increase in production in the october anderson merger accounted for bcf of the increase 
production from devon s domestic properties increased bcf  due primarily to drilling and development in devon s coalbed methane properties as well as the acquisition of certain properties in the second quarter of a per mcf increase in the average gas price in accounted for the remaining million of increased gas revenues 
ngl revenues vs 
ngl revenues increased million in an million barrel increase in production caused revenues to increase million 
the anderson and mitchell acquisitions accounted for million barrels of increased production 
this was partially offset by production lost from divestitures 
the effects of the net production increase were partially offset by a per barrel decrease in the average ngl price in vs 
ngl revenues decreased million in a decrease in s average price of per barrel caused ngl revenues to decrease million 
this was partially offset by a million increase related to a production increase of one million barrels 
the october anderson merger accounted for all of the increase 
marketing and midstream revenues vs 
marketing and midstream revenues increased million in the mitchell acquisition included significant marketing and midstream assets which accounted for substantially all of the increase in revenues 
vs 
marketing and midstream revenues increased million in this increase was primarily the result of capacity additions to devon s wyoming gas pipeline systems 
operating costs and expenses the details of the changes in operating costs and expenses between and are shown in the table below

n m not meaningful 
oil  gas and ngls production and operating expenses the details of the changes in production and operating expenses related to oil  gas and ngls producing activities between and are shown in the table below 
year ended december  vs vs expenses in millions lease operating expenses transportation costs production taxes total production and operating expenses expenses per boe lease operating expenses transportation costs production taxes total production and operating expenses vs 
lease operating expenses increased million in the anderson and mitchell acquisitions accounted for million of the increase 
the historical devon lease operating expenses decreased million primarily due to divestitures 
the drop in lease operating expenses per boe from in to in was primarily related to the lower cost properties acquired in the anderson and mitchell acquisitions and the divestiture of some of devon s higher cost properties 
transportation costs represent those costs paid directly to third party providers to transport oil  gas and ngl production sold downstream from the wellhead 
transportation costs increased million in primarily due to an increase in gas production from the anderson and mitchell acquisitions 
the majority of devon s production taxes are assessed on its onshore domestic properties 
in the us  most of the production taxes are based on a fixed percentage of revenues 
therefore  the decrease in domestic oil  gas and ngls revenues was the primary cause of a decrease in production taxes 
vs 
recurring lease operating expenses increased million in the anderson acquisition accounted for million of the increase in expenses 
the remaining increase in recurring costs was primarily caused by higher third party service  fuel and electricity costs 
transportation costs increased million in of this increase  million related to the anderson acquisition 
the remainder of the increase was primarily due to an increase in gas production from devon s domestic drilling and development activities 
as previously stated  most of the us production taxes are based on a fixed percentage of revenues 
therefore  the increase in domestic oil  gas and ngl revenues was the primary cause of a increase in domestic production taxes 
production taxes did not increase proportionately to the increase in revenues 
this was primarily due to the fact that most of the increase in domestic revenues occurred in the western division which has higher production tax rates than the other domestic divisions 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a dd a of oil and gas properties is calculated as the percentage of total proved reserve volumes produced during the year  multiplied by the net capitalized investment in those reserves including estimated future development and dismantlement and abandonment costs the depletable base 
generally  if reserve volumes are revised up or down  then the dd a rate per unit of production will change inversely 
however  if the depletable base changes  then the dd a rate moves in the same direction 
the per unit dd a rate is not affected by production volumes 
absolute or total dd a  as opposed to the rate per unit of production  generally moves in the same direction as production volumes 
oil and gas property dd a is calculated separately on a country by country basis 
vs 
oil and gas property related dd a increased million in a increase in s oil  gas and ngls production caused dd a to increase million 
the effects of the production increase were partially offset by a decrease in the combined us  canadian and international dd a rate from per boe in to per boe in the drop in the dd a rate was primarily due to reductions of carrying value of oil and gas properties recorded in the fourth quarter of and the second quarter of non oil and gas property dd a increased million in compared to depreciation of the marketing and midstream assets acquired in the january mitchell acquisition accounted for substantially all of the increase 
vs 
oil and gas property related dd a increased million in of this total increase  million was due to the increase in oil  gas and ngls production in the remaining million increase was due to an increase in the consolidated dd a rate 
this rate increased from per boe in to per boe in non oil and gas property dd a increased million in compared to depreciation of devon s wyoming gas pipeline systems accounted for the increase 
amortization of goodwill effective january   devon adopted the remaining provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

under sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are no longer amortized as they were prior to  but are instead tested for impairment at least annually 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 devon s goodwill amortization was million and million in and  respectively 
marketing and midstream operating costs and expenses vs 
marketing and midstream operating costs and expenses increased million in the mitchell acquisition included significant marketing and midstream assets which accounted for substantially all of the increase in revenues 
vs 
marketing and midstream operating costs and expenses increased million in this increase was primarily the result of capacity additions to devon s wyoming gas pipeline systems 
general and administrative expenses g a devon s net g a consists of three primary components 
the largest of these components is the gross amount of expenses incurred for personnel costs  office expenses  professional fees and other g a items 
the gross amount of these expenses is partially reduced by two offsetting components 
one is the amount of g a capitalized pursuant to the full cost method of accounting 
the other is the amount of g a reimbursed by working interest owners of properties for which devon serves as the operator 
these reimbursements are received during both the drilling and operational stages of a property s life 
the gross amount of g a incurred  less the amounts capitalized and reimbursed  is recorded as net g a in the consolidated statements of operations 
net g a includes expenses related to oil  gas and ngl exploration and production activities  as well as marketing and midstream activities 
see the following table for a summary of g a expenses by component 
year ended december  vs vs in millions gross g a capitalized g a reimbursed g a net g a vs 
gross g a increased million primarily due to additional costs incurred as a result of the anderson and mitchell acquisitions 
also included in s gross g a was million related to the abandonment of certain office space assumed in the santa fe snyder merger 
g a was reduced million due to an increase in the amount capitalized as part of oil and gas properties 
g a was also reduced million by an increase in the amount of reimbursements on operated properties 
changes in both of the capitalized and reimbursed amounts were primarily related to the anderson and mitchell acquisitions 
vs 
gross g a increased million primarily due to additional costs incurred as a result of the anderson acquisition and additional personnel related costs 
g a was reduced million due to an increase in the amount capitalized 
the increase in capitalized g a was primarily related to additional personnel related costs and increased acquisition  exploration and development activities 
g a was also reduced million by an increase in the amount of reimbursements on operated properties 
the increase in reimbursed g a was primarily related to an increase in the number of operated properties 
expenses related to mergers approximately million of expenses were incurred in in connection with the anderson acquisition 
these costs related to devon employees who were terminated as part of the anderson acquisition 
approximately million of expenses were incurred in in connection with the santa fe snyder merger 
these expenses consisted primarily of severance and other benefit costs  investment banking fees  other professional expenses  costs associated with duplicate facilities and various transaction related costs 
the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations required such costs to be expensed as opposed to capitalized as costs of the transaction 
reduction of carrying value of oil and gas properties under the full cost method of accounting  the net book value of oil and gas properties  less related deferred income taxes  may not exceed a calculated ceiling 
the ceiling limitation is the discounted estimated after tax future net revenues from proved oil and gas properties plus the cost of properties not subject to amortization 
the ceiling is imposed separately by country 
in calculating future net revenues  current prices and costs are generally held constant indefinitely  and devon does not include the effect of hedges in the calculation of the future net revenues 
the calculation also dictates the use of a discount factor 
therefore  the ceiling limitation is not necessarily indicative of the properties fair value 
the costs to be recovered are compared to the ceiling on a quarterly basis 
if the costs to be recovered exceed the ceiling  the excess is written off as an expense  except as discussed in the following paragraph 
if  subsequent to the end of the quarter but prior to the applicable financial statements being published  prices increase to levels such that the ceiling would exceed the costs to be recovered  a writedown otherwise indicated at the end of the quarter is not required to be recorded 
a writedown indicated at the end of a quarter is also not required if the value of additional reserves proved up on properties after the end of the quarter but prior to the publishing of the financial statements would result in the ceiling exceeding the costs to be recovered  as long as the properties were owned at the end of the quarter 
an expense recorded in one period may not be reversed in a subsequent period even though higher oil and gas prices may have increased the ceiling applicable to the subsequent period 
during and  devon reduced the carrying value of its oil and gas properties by and million  respectively  due to the full cost ceiling limitations 
the after tax effect of these reductions in and was million and million  respectively 
the following table summarizes these reductions by country 
year ended december  net of net of gross taxes gross taxes in millions united states canada total the canadian reduction was primarily the result of lower prices 
under the purchase method of accounting for business combinations  acquired oil and gas properties are recorded at fair value as of the date of purchase 
devon estimates such fair value using its estimates of future oil  gas and ngl prices 
in contrast  the ceiling calculation dictates that prices in effect as of the last day of the applicable quarter are held constant indefinitely 
accordingly  the resulting value is not necessarily indicative of the fair value of the reserves 
the recorded fair values of oil and gas properties added from the anderson acquisition in were based on expected future oil and gas prices that were higher than the june   prices used to calculate the canadian ceiling 
based on oil  natural gas and ngl cash market prices as of june   devon s canadian costs to be recovered exceeded the related ceiling value by million 
this after tax amount resulted in a pre tax reduction of the carrying value of devon s canadian oil and gas properties of million in the second quarter of this reduction was the result of a sharp drop in canadian gas prices during the last half of june the end of june reference prices used in the canadian ceiling calculation  expressed in canadian dollars based on an exchange ratio of  were a nymex price of c per barrel of oil and an aeco price of c per mmbtu 
the cash market prices of natural gas increased during the month of july prior to devon s release of its second quarter results  but the increase was not sufficient to offset the entire reduction calculated as of june the domestic and canadian reductions were also primarily the result of lower prices 
the oil and gas properties added from the anderson acquisition and other smaller acquisitions in were recorded at fair values that were based on expected future oil and gas prices higher than the december  prices used to calculate the ceiling 
the year end prices used to calculate the ceiling were based on a nymex oil price of per barrel  a henry hub gas price of per mmbtu and an aeco gas price of c per mmbtu 
additionally  during  devon elected to abandon operations in thailand  malaysia  qatar and on certain properties in brazil 
after meeting the drilling and capital commitments on these properties  devon determined that these properties did not meet devon s internal criteria to justify further investment 
accordingly  devon recorded a million charge associated with the impairment of these properties 
the after tax effect of this reduction was million 
the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which devon was required to adopt effective january   are only required to be applied prospectively 
as a result  these impairment charges have not been reclassified as part of the discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of operations 
other income expenses the details of the changes in other income expenses between and are shown in the table below

interest expense increased million in an increase in the average debt balance outstanding from billion in to billion in caused interest expense to increase million 
the increase in average debt outstanding was attributable primarily to the long term debt issued and assumed as a result of the mitchell and anderson acquisitions 
the average interest rate on outstanding debt decreased from in to in due to the favorable rates on the borrowings under the billion term loan credit facility 
this facility s rates averaged less than during the overall rate decrease caused interest expense to decrease million in other items included in interest expense that are not related to the debt balance outstanding were million higher in items not related to the balance of debt outstanding include early retirement premiums  facility and agency fees  amortization of costs and other miscellaneous items

interest expense increased million in of this total increase  million was caused by an increase in the average debt balance outstanding from billion in to billion in the increase in average debt outstanding was attributable primarily to the long term debt issued and assumed as a result of the october anderson acquisition 
the average interest rate on outstanding debt decreased from in to in this rate decrease caused interest expense to decrease million in other items included in interest expense that are not related to the debt balance outstanding were million higher in compared to the increase in other items was primarily related to an increase in accretion of discounts and a million loss related to an early retirement premium 
the increase in accretion of debt discounts in was related to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
effective january  devon s debentures that are exchangeable into shares of chevrontexaco corporation chevrontexaco common stock were revalued as of august  this is the date the debentures were assumed as part of the pennzenergy merger 
under sfas no 
 the total fair value of the debentures was allocated between the interest bearing debt and the option to exchange chevrontexaco common stock that is embedded in the debentures 
accordingly  the debt portion of the debentures was reduced by million as of august  this discount is being accreted in interest expense  which has raised the effective interest rate on the debentures to in compared to recorded prior to the accretion in was million 
effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates vs 
as a result of the anderson acquisition  a canadian subsidiary has million of fixed rate senior notes which are denominated in us dollars 
changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the canadian dollar from the dates the notes were acquired to the dates of repayment increase or decrease the expected amount of canadian dollars eventually required to repay the notes 
such changes in the canadian dollar equivalent balance of the debt are required to be included in determining net earnings for the period in which the exchange rate changes 
the increase in the canadian to us dollar exchange rate from at december  to at december  resulted in a million gain 
the drop in the canadian to us dollar exchange rate from at october  when the debt was assumed to at december  resulted in an million loss 
vs 
until mid january  a canadian subsidiary had certain fixed rate senior notes which were denominated in us dollars 
in mid january  these notes were retired prior to maturity 
the canadian to us dollar exchange rate dropped slightly in january prior to the debt retirement 
as a result  million of expense was recognized in change in fair value of financial instruments vs

 devon records in its statements of operations the change in fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
during and  devon recorded million and million  respectively  of gains related to changes in fair value 
the gains related principally to the option embedded in devon s debentures that are exchangeable into shares of chevrontexaco common stock 
also  devon recorded an million net gain in and a million net charge in related to the ineffectiveness of the various cash flow hedges 
impairment of chevrontexaco corporation common stock devon owns approximately million common shares of chevrontexaco 
the market value of these shares as of december   was approximately million 
devon acquired these shares in its august acquisition of pennzenergy company 
the shares are deposited with an exchange agent for possible exchange for million of debentures that are exchangeable into the chevrontexaco shares 
the debentures  which mature in august  were also assumed by devon in the pennzenergy acquisition 
devon initially recorded the chevrontexaco common shares at their market value at the closing date of the pennzenergy acquisition  which was per share  or an aggregate value of million 
since then  as the chevrontexaco shares have fluctuated in market value  the value of the shares on devon s balance sheet has been adjusted to the applicable market value 
through september   any decreases in the value of the chevrontexaco common shares were determined by devon to be temporary in nature 
therefore  the changes in value were recorded directly to stockholders equity and were not recorded in devon s results of operations through september  the determination that a decline in value of the chevrontexaco shares is temporary or other than temporary is subjective and influenced by many factors 
among these factors are the significance of the decline as a percentage of the original cost  the length of time the stock price has been below original cost  the performance of the stock price in relation to the stock price of its competitors within the industry and the market in general  and whether the decline is attributable to specific adverse conditions affecting chevrontexaco 
beginning in july  the market value of chevrontexaco common stock began what has ultimately become a significant decline 
the price per share decreased from at june   to per share at september   and to per share at december  the year end price of represents a decline since june   and a decline from the original valuation in august as a result of the continuation of the decline in value during the fourth quarter of  devon determined that the decline is other than temporary  as that term is defined by accounting rules 
therefore  the million cumulative decrease in the value of the chevrontexaco common shares from the initial acquisition in august to december   was recorded as a noncash charge to devon s results of operations in the fourth quarter of net of the applicable tax benefit  the charge reduced net earnings by million 
depending on the future performance of chevrontexaco s common stock  devon may be required to record additional noncash charges in future periods if devon determines that a decline in the value of such stock is other than temporary 
other income vs 
other income decreased million  or in other income in included a million gain from the settlement of a foreign exchange forward purchase contract entered into by devon related to the funding of the anderson acquisition 
this gain did not recur in vs 
other revenues increased million  or in as discussed previously  other income included a million gain from the settlement of a foreign exchange forward purchase contract entered into by devon related to the funding of the anderson acquisition

the rate  excluding the chevrontexaco common stock impairment and the oil and gas property writedown  was lower than the statutory federal tax rate primarily due to the tax benefits of certain foreign deductions 
the rate  excluding the oil and gas property writedowns  was higher than the statutory federal tax rate due to the effect of state taxes  goodwill amortization that was not deductible for income tax purposes and the effect of foreign income taxes

the rate was higher than the statutory federal tax rate due to the effect of state taxes  goodwill amortization that was not deductible for income tax purposes and the effect of foreign income taxes  offset in part by the recognition of a benefit from the disposition of devon s assets in venezuela 
results of discontinued operations effective january   devon was required to adopt sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes both sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  for the disposal of a segment of a business as previously defined in that opinion 
on april   devon sold its indonesian operations to petrochina company limited for total cash consideration of million 
on october   devon sold its argentine operations to petroleo brasileiro sa for total cash consideration of million 
on january   devon sold its egyptian operations to ipr transoil corporation for total cash consideration of million 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 devon has reclassified its indonesian  argentine and egyptian activities as discontinued operations 
this reclassification affects not only the presentation of financial results  but also the presentation of all prior periods results 
following are the components of the net results of discontinued operations for the years  and year ended december  in millions net gain on sale of discontinued operations earnings from discontinued operations before income taxes income tax expense net results of discontinued operations vs 
the decrease in earnings from discontinued operations before income taxes and the related income taxes from to was primarily due to the sale of these operations during vs 
the decrease in earnings from discontinued operations before income taxes and the related income taxes from to was primarily due to a decline in oil prices and the recognition of a million reduction in the carrying value of egyptian oil and gas properties 
the reduction in egypt was the result of high finding and development costs and negative revisions to proved reserves 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle at the time of adoption of sfas no 
 devon recorded a cumulative effect type adjustment to net earnings for a million gain related to the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify as hedges 
this gain included million related to the option embedded in the debentures that are exchangeable into shares of chevrontexaco common stock 
capital expenditures  capital resources and liquidity the following discussion of capital expenditures  capital resources and liquidity should be read in conjunction with the consolidated statements of cash flows included elsewhere in this report 
capital expenditures approximately billion was spent in for capital expenditures 
this total includes billion related to the january mitchell acquisition  billion for other acquisitions and the drilling or development of oil and gas properties  and billion related to marketing and midstream assets 
these amounts compare to total expenditures of billion billion of which related to the october anderson acquisition and billion of which was related to other acquisitions and the drilling or development of oil and gas properties and total expenditures of billion billion of which was related to the drilling or development of oil and gas properties 
other cash uses devon s common stock dividends were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
devon also paid million of preferred stock dividends in  and during  devon repurchased  shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of million or per share 
devon also repurchased shares of its common stock in under an odd lot repurchase program 
pursuant to this program  devon purchased and retired  shares of its common stock for a total cost of million  or per share 
capital resources and liquidity devon s primary source of liquidity has historically been net cash provided by operating activities operating cash flow 
this source has been supplemented as needed by accessing credit lines and commercial paper markets and issuing equity securities and long term debt securities 
in  another major source of liquidity was billion generated from sales of oil and gas properties 
operating cash flow devon s operating cash flow is sensitive to many variables  the most volatile of which is pricing of the oil  natural gas and ngls produced 
prices for these commodities are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions 
regional and worldwide economic activity  weather and other substantially variable factors influence market conditions for these products 
these factors are beyond devon s control and are difficult to predict 
to mitigate some of the risk inherent in oil and natural gas prices  devon has entered into various fixed price physical delivery contracts and financial price swap contracts to fix the price to be received for a portion of future oil and natural gas production 
additionally  devon has utilized price collars to set minimum and maximum prices on a portion of its production 
the table below provides the volumes associated with these various arrangements as of january fixed price physical price swap price delivery contracts contracts collars total oil production mmbbls natural gas production bcf in addition to the above quantities  devon also has fixed price physical delivery contracts  for the years through  covering canadian natural gas production ranging from bcf to bcf per year 
from through  devon also has canadian gas volumes subject to fixed price contracts  but the yearly volumes are less than bcf 
by removing the price volatility from a portion of its oil and natural gas production  devon has mitigated  but not eliminated  the potential negative effect of declining prices on its operating cash flow 
the combination of fixed price contracts  price swaps and price collars currently in place represents approximately of estimated oil production and of estimated natural gas production 
it is devon s policy to only enter into derivative contracts with investment grade rated counterparties deemed by management as competent and competitive market makers 
in december  devon announced that its capital expenditure budget for the year was approximately billion 
this capital budget represents the largest planned use of available operating cash flow 
to a certain degree  the ultimate timing of these capital expenditures is within devon s control 
therefore  if oil and natural gas prices decline to levels below its acceptable levels  devon could choose to defer a portion of these planned capital expenditures until later periods to achieve the desired balance between sources and uses of liquidity 
based upon current oil and gas price expectations for  devon anticipates that its operating cash flow will exceed its planned capital expenditures and other cash requirements for the year 
devon currently intends to accumulate any excess cash to fund future years debt maturities 
additional alternatives could be considered based upon the actual amount  if any  of such excess cash 
credit lines other sources of liquidity are devon s revolving lines of credit 
on june   devon renewed the million  day portion of its unsecured long term credit facilities the credit facilities 
the credit facilities include a us facility of million the us facility and a canadian facility of million the canadian facility 
the million us facility consists of a tranche a facility of million and a tranche b facility of million 
the tranche a facility matures on october  devon may borrow funds under the tranche b facility until june  the tranche b revolving period 
devon may request that the tranche b revolving period be extended an additional days by notifying the agent bank of such request between and days prior to the end of the tranche b revolving period 
on june   at the end of the tranche b revolving period  devon may convert the then outstanding balance under the tranche b facility to a two year term loan by paying the agent a fee of basis points 
the applicable borrowing rate would be at libor plus basis points 
on december   there were no borrowings outstanding under the million us facility 
the available capacity under the us facility as of december   net of million of outstanding letters of credit  was million 
devon may borrow funds under the million canadian facility until june  the canadian facility revolving period 
devon may request that the canadian facility revolving period be extended an additional days by notifying the agent bank of such request between and days prior to the end of the canadian facility revolving period 
debt outstanding as of the end of the canadian facility revolving period is payable in semiannual installments of each for the following five years  with the final installment due five years and one day following the end of the canadian facility revolving period 
on december   there were no borrowings under the million canadian facility 
under the terms of the credit facilities  devon has the right to reallocate up to million of the unused tranche b facility maximum credit amount to the canadian facility 
conversely  devon also has the right to reallocate up to million of unused canadian facility maximum credit amount to the tranche b facility 
amounts borrowed under the credit facilities bear interest at various fixed rate options that devon may elect for periods up to six months 
devon has historically elected a rate that is based upon libor  plus a margin dictated by devon s debt rating 
borrowings under the canadian facility have also been made under a rate based upon the bankers acceptance rate  plus a margin dictated by devon s debt rating 
based upon its current debt rating  devon can borrow under the credit facilities at a rate of between and basis points above libor based upon usage and the tranche utilized  and basis points above the bankers acceptance rate 
the credit facilities also provide for an annual facility fee of million that is payable quarterly 
devon also has access to short term credit under its commercial paper program 
total borrowings under the us facility and the commercial paper program may not exceed million 
commercial paper debt generally has a maturity of between seven to days  although it can have a maturity of up to days 
devon had no commercial paper debt outstanding at december  on july   devon renewed and increased its letter of credit and revolving bank facility loc facility for its canadian operations 
this c million loc facility will be used primarily by devon s wholly owned subsidiaries  devon canada corporation and northstar energy corporation  to issue letters of credit 
as of december   c million million converted to us dollars using the december  exchange rate of letters of credit were issued under the loc facility primarily for canadian drilling commitments 
a portion of cash used in the anderson and mitchell acquisitions was provided by a billion senior unsecured credit facility 
this credit facility  which was entered into in october  has a term of five years 
the billion credit facility was fully borrowed upon the closing of the mitchell acquisition on january  however  as of december   billion of the balance had been retired 
the primary sources of the repayments were the issuance of billion of debt securities  of which billion was used to pay down debt  and billion from the sale of certain oil and gas properties  of which billion was used to pay down debt 
the remaining balance outstanding as of december  will mature as follows in millions april  october  this billion facility includes various rate options which can be elected by devon  including a rate based on libor plus a margin 
through june   this margin was fixed at basis points 
thereafter  the margin is based on devon s debt rating 
based on devon s current debt rating  the margin after june   is basis points 
as of december   the average interest rate on this facility was 
devon s credit facilities and its billion term loan credit facility each contain only one material financial covenant 
this covenant requires devon to maintain a ratio of total funded debt to total capitalization of no more than 
the credit agreements contain definitions of total funded debt and total capitalization that include adjustments to the respective amounts reported in devon s consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with the agreements  total funded debt excludes the debentures that are exchangeable into shares of chevrontexaco common stock 
also  total capitalization is adjusted to add back noncash financial writedowns such as full cost ceiling property impairments or goodwill impairments 
as of december   devon s ratio of total funded debt to total capitalization  as defined in its credit agreements  was 
devon s access to funds from its credit facilities is not restricted under any material adverse condition clauses 
it is not uncommon for credit agreements to include such clauses 
these clauses can remove the obligation of the banks to fund the credit line if any condition or event would reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse effect on the borrower s financial condition  operations  properties or prospects considered as a whole  the borrower s ability to make timely debt payments  or the enforceability of material terms of the credit agreement 
while devon s credit facilities and its billion term loan credit facility include covenants that require devon to report a condition or event having a material adverse effect on the company  the obligation of the banks to fund the credit facilities is not conditioned on the absence of a material adverse effect 
long term debt securities on march   devon sold billion of notes due april  the net proceeds received  after discounts and issuance costs  were million 
the debt securities are unsecured and unsubordinated obligations of devon 
the net proceeds were partially used to pay down million on devon s billion term loan credit facility 
the remaining million of net proceeds was used in june to partially fund the early extinguishment of million of senior subordinated notes due june  the notes were redeemed at of principal  or approximately million 
debt ratings devon receives debt ratings from the major ratings agencies in the united states 
in determining devon s debt rating  the agencies consider a number of items including  but not limited to  debt levels  planned asset sales  near term and long term production growth opportunities  capital allocation challenges  liquidity  asset quality  cost structure  reserve mix  and commodity pricing levels 
devon s current debt ratings are bbb with a stable outlook by standard poor s  baa with a negative outlook by moody s and bbb with a stable outlook by fitch 
there are no rating triggers in any of devon s contractual obligations that would accelerate scheduled maturities should devon s debt rating fall below a specified level 
certain of devon s agreements related to its oil and natural gas hedges do contain provisions that could require devon to provide cash collateral in situations where devon s liability under the hedge is above a certain dollar threshold and where devon s debt rating is below investment grade bbb or baa 
however  devon s liability under these agreements would only exceed the threshold level in circumstances where the market prices for oil or natural gas were rising 
it is unlikely that devon s debt rating would be subjected to downgrades to non investment grade levels during such a period of rising oil and natural gas prices 
as summarized earlier in this section  devon s cost of borrowing under its credit facilities and its billion term loan facility is predicated on its corporate debt rating 
therefore  even though a ratings downgrade would not accelerate scheduled maturities  it would adversely impact devon s interest rate on its variable rate debt 
under the terms of the credit facilities and the term loan credit facility  a one notch downgrade would increase devon s fully drawn borrowing rates by basis points for each facility 
the average borrowing costs for the credit facilities would increase from libor plus basis points to libor plus basis points and the borrowing costs for the billion term loan facility would increase from libor plus basis points to libor plus basis points 
a ratings downgrade could also adversely impact devon s ability to economically access future debt markets 
as of january   devon was not aware of any potential ratings downgrades being contemplated by the rating agencies 
contractual obligations a summary of devon s contractual obligations as of december   is provided in the following table 
payments due by year after total in millions long term debt    operating leases drilling obligations firm transportation agreements total    firm transportation agreements represent ship or pay arrangements whereby devon has committed to ship certain volumes of gas for a fixed transportation fee 
devon has entered into these agreements to aid devon in moving its gas production to market 
the above table does not include million of letters of credit that have been issued by commercial banks on devon s behalf which  if funded  would become borrowings under devon s revolving credit facility 
most of these letters of credit have been granted by devon s financial institutions to support devon s canadian drilling commitments million of which are included in the above table 
the billion of long term debt shown in the table excludes million of discounts and a million fair value adjustment  both of which are included in the december   book balance of the debt 
pension obligations devon accounts for its defined benefit pension plans using sfas no 
 employer s accounting for pensions 
under sfas  pension expense is recognized on an accrual basis over employees approximate service periods 
pension expense calculated under sfas is generally independent of funding decisions or requirements 
devon recognized expense for its defined benefit pension plans of million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
devon estimates that its pension expense will approximate million in as compared to the projected benefit obligation  devon s qualified and nonqualified defined benefit plans were underfunded by million and million at december  and  respectively 
the increase in the underfunded amount during was primarily caused by additional underfunded obligations assumed in the january mitchell acquisition  losses on investments and actuarial losses 
a detailed reconciliation of the activity is included in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
of the million underfunded status at the end of  million is attributable to various nonqualified defined benefit plans which have no plan assets 
however  certain trusts have been established to assist devon in funding the benefit obligations of such nonqualified plans 
as of december   these trusts had investments with a market value of million 
the value of these trusts is included in noncurrent other assets in devon s accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
as compared to the accumulated benefit obligation  devon s qualified defined benefit plans were underfunded by million at december  the accumulated benefit obligation differs from the projected benefit obligation in that the former includes no assumption about future compensation levels 
devon s current intentions are to fund this accumulated benefit obligation deficit over the two year period ending december  the actual amount of contributions required during this period will depend on investment returns from the plan assets and any changes in actuarial assumptions made during the same period 
the calculation of pension expense and pension liability requires the use of a number of assumptions 
changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and liability amounts  and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions 
devon believes that the two most critical assumptions affecting pension expense and liabilities are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate 
devon assumed that its plan assets would generate a long term weighted average rate of return of at december  and  and at december  devon developed these expected long term rate of return assumptions by evaluating input from external consultants and economists as well as long term inflation assumptions 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on a target allocation of investment types in such assets 
the target investment mix for devon s plan assets are approximately domestic equities  international equities  and fixed income instruments 
devon believes that its long term asset allocation on average will approximate the targeted allocation 
devon regularly reviews its actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances the investments to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
pension expense increases as the expected rate of return on plan assets decreases 
a decrease in devon s long term rate of return assumption of basis points from to would increase the expected pension expense by approximately million 
devon discounted its future pension obligations using a weighted average rate of at december   compared to at december   and at december  the discount rate is determined at the end of each year based on the rate at which obligations could be effectively settled 
this rate is based on high quality bond yields  after allowing for call and default risk 
devon considers high quality corporate bond yield indices  such as moody s aa  when selecting the discount rate 
the pension liability and future pension expense both increase as the discount rate is reduced 
lowering the discount rate by basis points from to would increase devon s pension liability at december   by approximately million  and increase its estimated pension expense by approximately million 
at december   devon had unrecognized actuarial losses of million 
these losses will be recognized as a component of pension expense in future years 
devon estimates that approximately million  million and million of the unrecognized actuarial losses will be included in pension expense in  and  respectively 
the million estimated to be recognized in is a component of the total estimated pension expense of million referred to earlier in this discussion 
future changes in plan asset returns  assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in devon s defined benefit pension plans will impact future pension expense and liabilities 
devon cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future 
critical accounting policies full cost ceiling calculations devon follows the full cost method of accounting for its oil and gas properties 
the full cost method subjects companies to quarterly calculations of a ceiling  or limitation on the amount of properties that can be capitalized on the balance sheet 
if devon s capitalized costs are in excess of the calculated ceiling  the excess must be written off as an expense 
the ceiling limitation is imposed separately for each country in which devon has oil and gas properties 
devon s discounted present value of its proved oil  natural gas and ngl reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation  and represents the component that requires the most subjective judgments 
estimates of reserves are forecasts based on engineering data  projected future rates of production and the timing of future expenditures 
the process of estimating oil  natural gas and ngl reserves requires substantial judgment  resulting in imprecise determinations  particularly for new discoveries 
different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserve quantities based on the same data 
certain of devon s reserve estimates are prepared by outside consultants  while other reserve estimates are prepared by devon s engineers 
see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the passage of time provides more qualitative information regarding estimates of reserves  and revisions are made to prior estimates to reflect updated information 
in the past four years  devon s annual revisions to its reserve estimates have averaged approximately of the previous year s estimate 
however  there can be no assurance that more significant revisions will not be necessary in the future 
if future significant revisions are necessary that reduce previously estimated reserve quantities  it could result in a full cost property writedown 
in addition to the impact of the estimates of proved reserves on the calculation of the ceiling  estimates of proved reserves are also a significant component of the calculation of dd a 
while the quantities of proved reserves require substantial judgment  the associated prices of oil  natural gas and ngl reserves  and the applicable discount rate  that are used to calculate the discounted present value of the reserves do not require judgment 
the ceiling calculation dictates that prices and costs in effect as of the last day of the period are generally held constant indefinitely 
therefore  the future net revenues associated with the estimated proved reserves are not based on devon s assessment of future prices or costs  but rather are based on such prices and costs in effect as of the end of each quarter when the ceiling calculation is performed 
in calculating the ceiling  devon does not adjust the end of period price by the effect of cash flow hedges in place 
the ceiling calculation also dictates that a discount factor is to be used to calculate the present value of net cash flows 
because the ceiling calculation dictates that prices in effect as of the last day of the applicable quarter are held constant indefinitely  and requires a discount factor  the resulting value is not indicative of the true fair value of the reserves 
oil and natural gas prices have historically been cyclical and  on any particular day at the end of a quarter  can be either substantially higher or lower than devon s long term price forecast that is a barometer for true fair value 
therefore  oil and gas property writedowns that result from applying the full cost ceiling limitation  and that are caused by fluctuations in price as opposed to reductions to the underlying quantities of reserves  should not be viewed as absolute indicators of a reduction of the ultimate value of the related reserves 
devon recorded writedowns to its canadian oil and gas properties as of june  based on oil and natural gas cash market prices as of june   devon s canadian costs to be recovered exceeded the related ceiling value by million 
this after tax amount resulted in a pre tax reduction of the carrying value of devon s canadian oil and gas properties of million in the second quarter of this reduction was the result of a sharp drop in canadian gas prices during the last half of june the end of june reference prices used in the canadian ceiling calculation  expressed in canadian dollars based on an exchange ratio of  were a nymex price of c per barrel of oil and an aeco price of c per mmbtu 
devon also recorded writedowns to its domestic and canadian oil and gas properties as of december  the domestic properties were reduced by million and the canadian properties were reduced by million 
the year end prices used to calculate the ceiling were based on a nymex oil price of per barrel  a henry hub gas price of per mmbtu and an aeco gas price of c per mmbtu 
if oil or gas prices at the end of future quarters drop below these june  or december  prices  or if devon reduces its estimates of proved reserve quantities  further writedowns would likely occur 
fair values of derivative instruments the estimated fair values of devon s derivative instruments are recorded on devon s consolidated balance sheets 
substantially all of devon s derivative instruments represent hedges of the price of future oil and natural gas production 
therefore  while fair values of such hedging instruments must be estimated as of the end of each reporting period  the changes in the fair values are not included in devon s consolidated results of operations 
instead  the changes in fair value of hedging instruments are recorded directly to stockholders equity until the hedged oil or natural gas quantities are produced 
the estimates of the fair values of devon s hedging derivatives require substantial judgment 
devon obtains forward price and volatility data for all major oil and gas trading points in north america from independent third parties 
these forward prices are compared to the price parameters contained in the hedge agreements  and the resulting estimated future cash inflows or outflows over the lives of the hedges are discounted using devon s current borrowing rates under its revolving credit facilities 
in addition  devon estimates the option value of price floors and price caps using the black scholes option pricing model 
these pricing and discounting variables are sensitive to market volatility as well as changes in forward prices  regional price differentials and interest rates 
as stated earlier  substantially all of devon s derivative instruments are hedges of the price of future oil and natural gas production 
devon is not involved in any speculative trading activities of derivatives 
business combinations devon has grown substantially during recent years through acquisitions of other oil and natural gas companies 
most of these acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and recent accounting pronouncements require that all future acquisitions will be accounted for using the purchase method 
under the purchase method  the acquiring company adds to its balance sheet the estimated fair values of the acquired company s assets and liabilities 
any excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the tangible and intangible net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
as of january   the accounting for goodwill has changed 
in prior years  goodwill was amortized over its estimated useful life 
as of  goodwill is no longer amortized  but instead is assessed for impairment at least annually 
there are various assumptions made by devon in determining the fair values of an acquired company s assets and liabilities 
the most significant assumptions  and the ones requiring the most judgment  involve the estimated fair values of the oil and gas properties acquired 
to determine the fair values of these properties  devon prepares estimates of oil  natural gas and ngl reserves 
these estimates are based on work performed by devon s engineers and that of outside consultants 
the judgments associated with these estimated reserves are described earlier in this section in connection with the full cost ceiling calculation 
however  there are factors involved in estimating the fair values of acquired oil  natural gas and ngl properties that require more judgment than that involved in the full cost ceiling calculation 
as stated above  the full cost ceiling calculation applies current price and cost information to the reserves to arrive at the ceiling amount 
by contrast  the fair value of reserves acquired in a business combination must be based on devon s estimates of future oil  natural gas and ngl prices 
devon s estimates of future prices are based on its own analysis of pricing trends 
these estimates are based on current data obtained with regard to regional and worldwide supply and demand dynamics such as economic growth forecasts 
they are also based on industry data regarding natural gas storage availability  drilling rig activity  changes in delivery capacity  trends in regional pricing differentials and other fundamental analysis 
future price forecasts from independent third parties are noted when devon makes its pricing estimates 
devon s estimates of future prices are applied to the estimated reserve quantities acquired to arrive at estimates of future net revenues 
for estimated proved reserves  the future net revenues are then discounted using a rate determined appropriate at the time of the business combination based upon devon s cost of capital 
devon also applies these same general principles in arriving at the fair value of unproved reserves acquired in a business combination 
these unproved reserves are generally classified as either probable or possible reserves 
because of their very nature  probable and possible reserve estimates are more imprecise than those of proved reserves 
to compensate for the inherent risk of estimating and valuing unproved reserves  the discounted future net revenues of probable and possible reserves are reduced by what devon considers to be an appropriate risk weighting factor in each particular instance 
it is common for the discounted future net revenues of probable and possible reserves to be reduced by factors ranging from to to arrive at what devon considers to be the appropriate fair values 
generally  in devon s business combinations  the determination of the fair values of oil and gas properties requires much more judgment than the fair values of other assets and liabilities 
the acquired companies commonly have long term debt that devon assumes in the acquisition  and this debt must be recorded at the estimated fair value as if devon had issued such debt 
however  significant judgment on devon s behalf is usually not required in these situations due to the existence of comparable market values of debt issued by devon s peer companies 
prior to the mitchell acquisition  devon s mergers and acquisitions have involved other entities whose operations were predominantly in the area of exploration  development and production activities related to oil and gas properties 
however  in addition to exploration  development and production activities  mitchell s business also included substantial marketing and midstream activities 
therefore  a portion of the mitchell purchase price was allocated to the fair value of mitchell s marketing and midstream facilities and equipment  which consisted primarily of natural gas processing plants and natural gas pipeline systems 
because the mitchell marketing and midstream assets primarily served gas producing properties that were also acquired by devon from mitchell  certain of the assumptions regarding future operations of the gas producing properties were also integral to the value of the marketing and midstream assets 
for example  future quantities of natural gas estimated to be processed by natural gas processing plants were based on the same estimates used to value the proved and unproved gas producing properties 
future expected prices for marketing and midstream product sales were also based on price cases consistent with those used to value the oil and gas producing assets acquired from mitchell 
based on historical costs and known trends and commitments  devon also estimated future operating and capital costs of the marketing and midstream assets to arrive at estimated future cash flows 
these cash flows were discounted at rates consistent with those used to discount future net cash flows from oil and gas producing assets to arrive at devon s estimated fair value of the marketing and midstream facilities and equipment 
valuation of goodwill effective january   devon adopted the remaining provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are no longer amortized  but are instead tested for impairment at least annually 
this requires devon to estimate the fair values of its own assets and liabilities in a manner similar to the process described above for a business combination 
therefore  considerable judgment similar to that described above in connection with estimating the fair value of an acquired company in a business combination is also required to assess goodwill for impairment on an annual basis 
impact of recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires liability recognition for retirement obligations associated with tangible long lived assets  such as producing well sites  offshore production platforms  and natural gas processing plants 
the obligations included within the scope of sfas no 
are those for which a company faces a legal obligation for settlement 
the initial measurement of the asset retirement obligation is to be the discounted present fair value  defined as the price that an entity would have to pay a willing third party of comparable credit standing to assume the liability in a current transaction other than in a forced or liquidation sale 
the asset retirement cost equal to the discounted fair value of the retirement obligation is to be capitalized as part of the cost of the related long lived asset and allocated to expense using a systematic and rational method 
devon will adopt sfas no 
effective january  using a cumulative effect approach to recognize transition amounts for asset retirement obligations  asset retirement costs and accumulated depreciation 
devon previously estimated costs of dismantlement  removal  site reclamation  and other similar activities in the total costs that are subject to depreciation  depletion  and amortization 
however  devon did not record a separate asset or liability for such amounts 
upon adoption of sfas no 
on january   devon expects to record a cumulative effect type adjustment for an increase to net earnings of between million and million  net of deferred tax expense of between million and million 
additionally  devon expects to establish an asset retirement obligation of between million and million  an increase to property and equipment of between million and million and a decrease in accumulated dd a of between million and million 
the fasb issued statement no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections  on april  sfas no 
will be effective for fiscal years beginning after may  this statement rescinds sfas no 
 reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt  and requires that all gains and losses from extinguishment of debt should be classified as extraordinary items only if they meet the criteria in apb no 
applying apb no 
will distinguish transactions that are part of an entity s recurring operations from those that are unusual or infrequent or that meet the criteria for classification as an extraordinary item 
any gain or loss on extinguishment of debt that was classified as an extraordinary item in prior periods presented that does not meet the criteria in apb no 
for classification as an extraordinary item must be reclassified 
devon early adopted the provisions related to sfas no 
during the fourth quarter with the adoption of sfas no 
 a loss of million resulting from extinguishment of debt in was reclassified from extraordinary loss to interest expense  and s current income tax expense was reduced by the million tax benefit related to the loss from early extinguishment 
the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  in june sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
applies to costs incurred in an exit activity  which includes  but is not limited to  a restructuring  or a disposal activity covered by sfas no 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
previously  under issue  a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
statement no 
also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  devon currently has no such exit or disposal activities planned 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness to others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
 and and a rescission of fasb interpretation no 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees issued 
the interpretation also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of the interpretation are applicable to guarantees issued or modified after december  and are not expected to have a material effect on devon s financial statements 
the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim and annual periods ending after december  and are included in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
this statement amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of statement no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements 
certain of the disclosure modifications are required for fiscal years ending after december  and are included in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
interpretation no 
requires a company to consolidate a variable interest entity if the company has a variable interest or combination of variable interests that will absorb a majority of the entity s expected losses if they occur  receive a majority of the entity s expected residual returns if they occur  or both 
a direct or indirect ability to make decisions that significantly affect the results of the activities of a variable interest entity is a strong indication that a company has one or both of the characteristics that would require consolidation of the variable interest entity 
interpretation no 
also requires additional disclosures regarding variable interest entities 
the new interpretation is effective immediately for variable interest entities created after january   and is effective in the first interim or annual period beginning after june   for variable interest entities in which a company holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  devon owns no interests in variable interest entities  and therefore this new interpretation will not affect devon s consolidated financial statements 
estimates the forward looking statements provided in this discussion are based on management s examination of historical operating trends  the information which was used to prepare the december  reserve reports of independent petroleum engineers and other data in devon s possession or available from third parties 
devon cautions that its future oil  natural gas and ngl production  revenues and expenses are subject to all of the risks and uncertainties normally incident to the exploration for and development  production and sale of oil  gas and ngls 
these risks include  but are not limited to  price volatility  inflation or lack of availability of goods and services  environmental risks  drilling risks  regulatory changes  the uncertainty inherent in estimating future oil and gas production or reserves  and other risks as outlined below 
additionally  devon cautions that its future marketing and midstream revenues and expenses are subject to all of the risks and uncertainties normally incident to the marketing and midstream business 
these risks include  but are not limited to  price volatility  environmental risks  regulatory changes  the uncertainty inherent in estimating future processing volumes and pipeline throughput  cost of goods and services and other risks as outlined below 
also  the financial results of devon s foreign operations are subject to currency exchange rate risks 
additional risks are discussed below in the context of line items most affected by such risks 
specific assumptions and risks related to price and production estimates prices for oil  natural gas and ngls are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions 
market conditions for these products are influenced by regional and worldwide economic conditions  weather and other local market conditions 
these factors are beyond devon s control and are difficult to predict 
in addition to volatility in general  devon s oil  gas and ngl prices may vary considerably due to differences between regional markets  transportation availability and costs and demand for the various products derived from oil  natural gas and ngls 
substantially all of devon s revenues are attributable to sales  processing and transportation of these three commodities 
consequently  devon s financial results and resources are highly influenced by price volatility 
estimates for devon s future production of oil  natural gas and ngls are based on the assumption that market demand and prices for oil  gas and ngls will continue at levels that allow for profitable production of these products 
there can be no assurance of such stability 
also  devon s international production of oil  natural gas and ngls is governed by payout agreements with the governments of the countries in which devon operates 
if the payout under these agreements is attained earlier than projected  devon s net production and proved reserves in such areas could be reduced 
estimates for devon s future processing and transport of oil  natural gas and ngls are based on the assumption that market demand and prices for oil  gas and ngls will continue at levels that allow for profitable processing and transport of these products 
there can be no assurance of such stability 
the production  transportation  processing and marketing of oil  natural gas and ngls are complex processes which are subject to disruption due to transportation and processing availability  mechanical failure  human error  meteorological events including  but not limited to  hurricanes  and numerous other factors 
the following forward looking statements were prepared assuming demand  curtailment  producibility and general market conditions for devon s oil  natural gas and ngls during will be substantially similar to those of  unless otherwise noted 
given the general limitations expressed herein  following are devon s forward looking statements for unless otherwise noted  all of the following dollar amounts are expressed in us dollars 
amounts related to canadian operations have been converted to us dollars using an exchange rate of us dollar to canadian dollar 
the actual exchange rate may vary materially from this estimated rate 
such variations could have a material effect on the following estimates 
though devon has completed several major property acquisitions and dispositions in recent years  these transactions are opportunity driven 
thus  devon does not budget  nor can it reasonably predict  the timing or size of such possible acquisitions or dispositions  if any 
as discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  on february   devon announced its intent to merge with ocean energy  inc ocean 
the following forward looking estimates do not include the additional revenues and expenses that devon will report in if this merger is consummated 
geographic reporting areas for the following estimates of production  average price differentials and capital expenditures are provided separately for each of the following geographic areas the united states  canada  and international  which encompasses all oil and gas properties that lie outside of the united states and canada

the floor and ceiling prices related to domestic and canadian oil production are based on the nymex price 
if the nymex price is outside of the ranges set by the floor and ceiling prices in the various collars  devon and the counterparty to the collars will settle the difference 
any such settlements will either increase or decrease devon s oil revenues for the period 
because devon s oil volumes are often sold at prices that differ from the nymex price due to differing quality ie  sweet crude versus sour crude and transportation costs from different geographic areas  the floor and ceiling prices of the various collars do not reflect actual limits of devon s realized prices for the production volumes related to the collars 
to simplify presentation  devon s costless collars as of january   have been aggregated in the following table according to similar floor prices and similar ceiling prices

of this total  is estimated to be produced from reserves classified as proved at december  the expected ranges of production by area are as follows mmbbls united states to canada to marketing and midstream revenues and expenses devon s marketing and midstream revenues and expenses are derived primarily from its natural gas processing plants and natural gas transport pipelines 
these revenues and expenses vary in response to several factors 
the factors include  but are not limited to  changes in production from wells connected to the pipelines and related processing plants  changes in the absolute and relative prices of natural gas and ngls  provisions of the agreements  and the amount of repair and workover activity required to maintain anticipated processing levels 
these factors  coupled with uncertainty of future natural gas and ngl prices  increase the uncertainty inherent in estimating future marketing and midstream revenues and expenses 
given these uncertainties  devon estimates that marketing and midstream revenues will be between billion and billion and marketing and midstream expenses will be between million and billion 
production and operating expenses devon s production and operating expenses include lease operating expenses  transportation costs and production taxes 
these expenses vary in response to several factors 
among the most significant of these factors are additions to or deletions from devon s property base  changes in production tax rates  changes in the general price level of services and materials that are used in the operation of the properties and the amount of repair and workover activity required 
oil  natural gas and ngl prices also have an effect on lease operating expenses and impact the economic feasibility of planned workover projects 
given these uncertainties  devon estimates that lease operating expenses will be between million and million  transportation costs will be between million and million  and production taxes will be between and of consolidated oil  natural gas and ngl revenues  excluding revenues related to hedges upon which production taxes are not incurred 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a the oil and gas property dd a rate will depend on various factors 
most notable among such factors are the amount of proved reserves that will be added from drilling or acquisition efforts in compared to the costs incurred for such efforts  and the revisions to devon s year end reserve estimates that  based on prior experience  are likely to be made during based on these uncertainties  oil and gas property related dd a expense for is expected to be between billion and billion 
additionally  devon expects its dd a expense related to non oil and gas property fixed assets to total between million and million 
this range includes million to million related to marketing and midstream assets 
based on these dd a amounts and the production estimates set forth earlier  devon expects its consolidated dd a rate will be between per boe and per boe 
accretion of asset retirement obligation as discussed in the previous section titled impact of recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted  devon adopted sfas no 
effective january  using a cumulative effect approach to recognize transition amounts for asset retirement obligations  asset retirement costs and accumulated depreciation 
sfas no 
requires liability recognition for retirement obligations associated with tangible long lived assets  such as producing well sites  offshore production platforms  and natural gas processing plants 
the obligations included within the scope of sfas no 
are those for which a company faces a legal obligation for settlement 
the initial measurement of the asset retirement obligation is to be the discounted present fair value  defined as the price that an entity would have to pay a willing third party of comparable credit standing to assume the liability in a current transaction other than in a forced or liquidation sale 
because the asset retirement obligation is a discounted value  accretion will be recognized as the estimated date for settling the obligation draws closer 
as a result of the requirements of sfas no 
 devon expects its accretion of its asset retirement obligation related to the adoption of sfas to be between million and million 
general and administrative expenses g a devon s g a includes the costs of many different goods and services used in support of its business 
these goods and services are subject to general price level increases or decreases 
in addition  devon s g a varies with its level of activity and the related staffing needs as well as with the amount of professional services required during any given period 
should devon s needs or the prices of the required goods and services differ significantly from current expectations  actual g a could vary materially from the estimate 
given these limitations  consolidated g a in is expected to be between million and million 
interest expense future interest rates  debt outstanding and oil  natural gas and ngl prices have a significant effect on devon s interest expense 
devon can only marginally influence the prices it will receive in from sales of oil  natural gas and ngls and the resulting cash flow 
these factors increase the margin of error inherent in estimating future interest expense 
other factors which affect interest expense  such as the amount and timing of capital expenditures  are within devon s control 
assuming no changes in fixed rate debt balances during  devon s average balance of fixed rate debt during will be billion 
the interest expense in related to this fixed rate debt  including net accretion of related discounts  will be approximately million 
this fixed rate debt removes the uncertainty of future interest rates from some  but not all  of devon s long term debt 
devon s floating rate debt is discussed in the following paragraphs 
as of january   devon had billion outstanding under its original billion amortizing senior unsecured term loan credit facility 
this credit facility  which was entered into in october  has a term of five years 
this credit facility is non revolving 
the remaining balance outstanding as of january  will mature as follows in millions april  october  this billion facility includes various rate options which can be elected by devon  including a rate based on libor plus a margin 
the margin is based on devon s debt rating 
based on devon s current debt rating  the margin is basis points 
as of january   the average interest rate on this facility was 
from time to time  devon borrows under its billion credit facilities 
borrowings under the us facility  currently set at million  may be borrowed at various rate options including libor plus a margin with interest periods of up to six months 
borrowings under the canadian facility  currently set at million  may be made at various rate options including libor plus a margin with interest periods up to six months  or bankers acceptances plus a margin with interest periods of to days 
the current libor margin ranges from to basis points based upon usage and the tranche utilized  and the current bankers acceptance margin is basis points over the cost of funding 
there were no borrowings under these facilities at january  devon also borrows under a million canadian dollar letter of credit facility which is primarily used to issue letters of credit in association with devon s canadian drilling commitments 
as of december   there were million canadian dollars of issued letters of credit under this facility 
devon may also use this facility for general corporate purposes 
from time to time  devon also borrows under its commercial paper facility 
total borrowings under the million us facility and the commercial paper program cannot exceed million 
there were no borrowings under the commercial paper facility as of december  commercial paper borrowing costs are typically to basis points over libor 
debt outstanding under this program is generally borrowed for seven to day periods  and may be borrowed up to days  at prevailing commercial paper market rates 
devon has fixed the interest rate on million canadian dollars and million us dollars of its floating rate debt through swap agreements at average rates of and  respectively 
the canadian dollar swap agreements mature at various dates through july and the us dollar swap agreement matures in may devon has also entered into an interest rate swap on its million senior notes due in to swap a fixed interest rate for a variable interest rate 
the variable interest rate on this instrument is based on libor plus a margin of basis points 
the interest rate swap is accounted for as a fair value hedge under sfas devon s interest expense totals have historically included payments of facility and agency fees  amortization of debt issuance costs  the effect of the interest rate swaps  and other miscellaneous items not related to the debt balances outstanding 
devon expects between million and million of such items to be included in its interest expense 
based on the information related to interest expense set forth herein and assuming no material changes in devon s levels of indebtedness or prevailing interest rates  devon expects its interest expense will be between million and million 
reduction of carrying value of oil and gas properties devon follows the full cost method of accounting for its oil and gas properties 
under the full cost method  devon s net book value of oil and gas properties  less related deferred income taxes the costs to be recovered  may not exceed a calculated full cost ceiling 
the ceiling limitation is the discounted estimated after tax future net revenues from oil and gas properties plus the cost of properties not subject to amortization 
the ceiling is imposed separately by country 
in calculating future net revenues  current prices and costs are generally held constant indefinitely 
the costs to be recovered are compared to the ceiling on a quarterly basis 
if the costs to be recovered exceed the ceiling  the excess is written off as an expense 
an expense recorded in one period may not be reversed in a subsequent period even though higher oil and gas prices may have increased the ceiling applicable to the subsequent period 
because the ceiling calculation dictates that prices in effect as of the last day of the applicable quarter are held constant indefinitely  and requires a discount factor  the resulting value is not indicative of the true fair value of the reserves 
oil and natural gas prices have historically been cyclical and  on any particular day at the end of a quarter  can be either substantially higher or lower than devon s long term price forecast that is a barometer for true fair value 
therefore  oil and gas property writedowns that result from applying the full cost ceiling limitation  and that are caused by fluctuations in price as opposed to reductions to the underlying quantities of reserves  should not be viewed as absolute indicators of a reduction of the ultimate value of the related reserves 
because of the volatile nature of oil and gas prices  it is not possible to predict whether devon will incur a full cost writedown in future periods 
effects of changes in foreign currency rates devon s canadian subsidiary has million of fixed rate senior notes which are denominated in us dollars 
changes in the exchange rate between the us dollar and the canadian dollar during will increase or decrease the canadian dollar equivalent balance of this debt 
such changes in the canadian dollar equivalent balance of the debt are required to be included in determining net earnings for the period in which the exchange rate changes 
because of the variability of the exchange rate  it is not possible to estimate the effect which will be recorded in however  based on the january   canadian to us dollar exchange rate of  for every change in the exchange rate  devon will record an effect either income or expense of approximately million canadian dollars 
the resulting revenue or expense in us dollars will depend on the currency exchange rate in effect throughout the year 
other revenues devon s other revenues in are expected to be between million and million 
income taxes devon s financial income tax rate in will vary materially depending on the actual amount of financial pre tax earnings 
the tax rate for will be significantly affected by the proportional share of consolidated pre tax earnings generated by us  canadian and international operations due to the different tax rates of each country 
there are certain tax deductions and credits that will have a fixed impact on s income tax expense regardless of the level of pre tax earnings that are produced 
given the uncertainty of its pre tax earnings amount  devon estimates that its consolidated financial income tax rate in will be between and 
the current income tax rate is expected to be between and 
the deferred income tax rate is expected to be between and 
significant changes in estimated capital expenditures  production levels of oil  gas and ngls  the prices of such products  marketing and midstream revenues  or any of the various expense items could materially alter the effect of the aforementioned tax deductions and credits on s financial income tax rates 
year potential capital sources  uses and liquidity capital expenditures though devon has completed several major property acquisitions in recent years  these transactions are opportunity driven 
thus  devon does not budget  nor can it reasonably predict  the timing or size of such possible acquisitions  if any 
as discussed in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements  on february   devon announced its intention to merge with ocean 
the following forward looking estimates do not include the additional capital expenditures that devon will report in if this merger is consummated 
devon s capital expenditures budget is based on an expected range of future oil  natural gas and ngl prices as well as the expected costs of the capital additions 
should actual prices received differ materially from devon s price expectations for its future production  some projects may be accelerated or deferred and  consequently  may increase or decrease total capital expenditures 
in addition  if the actual costs of the budgeted items vary significantly from the anticipated amounts  actual capital expenditures could vary materially from devon s estimates 
given the limitations discussed  devon expects its capital expenditures for drilling and development efforts  plus related facilities  to total between billion and billion 
these amounts include between million and million for drilling and facilities costs related to reserves classified as proved as of year end in addition  these amounts include between million and million for other low risk reward projects and between million and million for new  higher risk reward projects 
low risk reward projects include development drilling that does not offset currently productive units and for which there is not a certainty of continued production from a known productive formation 
higher risk reward projects include exploratory drilling to find and produce oil or gas in previously untested fault blocks or new reservoirs 
the following table shows expected drilling and production facilities expenditures by geographic area 
united states canada international total in millions related to proved reserves lower risk reward projects higher risk reward projects total  in addition to the above expenditures for drilling and development  devon expects to spend between million to million on its marketing and midstream assets  which include its oil pipelines  gas processing plants  treating facilities and gas pipelines 
devon also expects to capitalize between million and million of g a expenses in accordance with the full cost method of accounting 
devon also expects to pay between million and million for plugging and abandonment charges  and to spend between million and million for other non oil and gas property fixed assets 
other cash uses devon s management expects the policy of paying a quarterly common stock dividend to continue 
with the current per share quarterly dividend rate and million shares of common stock outstanding  dividends are expected to approximate million 
also  devon has million of cumulative preferred stock upon which it will pay million of dividends in capital resources and liquidity devon s estimated cash uses  including its drilling and development activities  are expected to be funded primarily through a combination of working capital and operating cash flow 
the amount of operating cash flow to be generated during is uncertain due to the factors affecting revenues and expenses as previously cited 
however  based upon current oil and gas price expectations for  devon anticipates that its operating cash flow will exceed its planned capital expenditures and other cash requirements for the year 
devon currently intends to accumulate any excess cash to fund future years debt maturities 
additional alternatives could be considered based upon the actual amount  if any  of such excess cash 
if significant acquisitions or other unplanned capital requirements arise during the year  devon could utilize its existing credit facilities and or seek to establish and utilize other sources of financing 
as of december   devon had million available under its billion credit facilities  net of million of outstanding letters of credit 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about devon s potential exposure to market risks 
the term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil  gas and ngl prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses  but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses 
this forward looking information provides indicators of how devon views and manages its ongoing market risk exposures 
all of devon s market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than speculative trading 
commodity price risk devon s major market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to its oil  gas and ngls production 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot market prices applicable to its us and canadian natural gas and ngl production 
pricing for oil  gas and ngl production has been volatile and unpredictable for several years 
devon periodically enters into financial hedging activities with respect to a portion of its projected oil and natural gas production through various financial transactions which hedge the future prices received 
these transactions include financial price swaps whereby devon will receive a fixed price for its production and pay a variable market price to the contract counterparty  and costless price collars that set a floor and ceiling price for the hedged production 
if the applicable monthly price indices are outside of the ranges set by the floor and ceiling prices in the various collars  devon and the counterparty to the collars will settle the difference 
these financial hedging activities are intended to support oil and natural gas prices at targeted levels and to manage devon s exposure to oil and gas price fluctuations 
devon does not hold or issue derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes 
devon s total hedged positions as of january  are set forth in the following tables 
price swaps through various price swaps  devon has fixed the price it will receive on a portion of its natural gas production in these swaps will result in a fixed price of per mcf on  mcf per day of domestic production during where necessary  the prices related to these swaps have been adjusted for certain transportation costs that are netted against the price recorded by devon  and the price has also been adjusted for the btu content of the gas production that has been hedged 
costless price collars devon has also entered into costless price collars that set a floor and ceiling price for a portion of its and oil and natural gas production 
the following tables include information on these collars for each geographic area 
the floor and ceiling prices related to domestic oil production are based on nymex 
the nymex price is the monthly average of settled prices on each trading day for west texas intermediate crude oil delivered at cushing  oklahoma 
the gas prices shown in the following table have been adjusted to a nymex based price  using devon s estimates of differentials between nymex and the specific regional indices upon which the collars are based 
the floor and ceiling prices related to the domestic collars are based on various regional first of the month price indices as published monthly by inside ferc 
the floor and ceiling prices related to the canadian collars are based on the aeco index as published by the canadian gas price reporter 
if the applicable monthly price indices are outside of the ranges set by the floor and ceiling prices in the various collars  devon and the counterparty to the collars will settle the difference 
any such settlements will either increase or decrease devon s oil or gas revenues for the period 
because devon s gas volumes are often sold at prices that differ from the related regional indices  and due to differing btu content of gas production  the floor and ceiling prices of the various collars do not reflect actual limits of devon s realized prices for the production volumes related to the collars 
the floor and ceiling prices in the following tables are weighted averages of all the various collars 
oil production weighted average floor ceiling price price months of area range of floor prices ceiling prices bbls day per bbl per bbl production united states  jan dec united states  jan dec united states  jul dec canada  jan dec canada  jan dec canada  jan dec canada  jul dec weighted average floor ceiling price price months of area range of floor prices ceiling prices bbls day per bbl per bbl production united states  jan dec canada  jan dec gas production weighted average floor ceiling price per price per months of area range of floor prices ceiling prices mmbtu day mmbtu mmbtu production united states  jan dec united states  jan dec united states  jan dec united states  jan dec united states  jan dec united states  apr sep canada  jan dec canada  jan dec canada  jan dec canada  apr oct canada  jan dec weighted average floor ceiling price per price per months of area range of floor prices ceiling prices mmbtu day mmbtu mmbtu production united states  jan dec united states  jan dec canada  jan dec canada  jan dec canada  jan dec canada  jan dec devon uses a sensitivity analysis technique to evaluate the hypothetical effect that changes in the market value of oil and gas may have on the fair value of its commodity hedging instruments 
at january   a increase in the underlying commodities prices would have reduced the fair value of devon s commodity hedging instruments by million 
fixed price physical delivery contracts in addition to the commodity hedging instruments described above  devon also manages its exposure to oil and gas price risks by periodically entering into fixed price contracts 
devon has fixed price physical delivery contracts for the years through covering canadian natural gas production ranging from bcf to bcf per year 
from through  devon also has canadian gas volumes subject to fixed price contracts  but the yearly volumes are less than bcf 
interest rate risk at december   devon had long term debt outstanding of billion 
of this amount  billion  or  bears interest at fixed rates averaging 
the remaining billion of debt outstanding bears interest at floating rates which averaged 
the terms of devon s various floating rate debt facilities revolving credit facilities  commercial paper and term loan credit facility allow interest rates to be fixed at devon s option for periods of between seven to days 
a increase in short term interest rates on the floating rate debt outstanding as of december  would equal approximately basis points 
such an increase in interest rates would increase devon s interest expense by approximately million assuming borrowed amounts remain outstanding for all of devon assumed certain interest rate swaps as a result of the anderson acquisition 
under these interest rate swaps  devon has swapped a floating rate for a fixed rate 
under such swaps  devon will record a fixed rate of on million of debt in  on million of debt in through and on million of debt in the amount of gains or losses realized from such swaps are included as increases or decreases to interest expense 
devon uses a sensitivity analysis technique to evaluate the hypothetical effect that changes in interest rates may have on the fair value of its interest rate swap instruments 
at january   a increase in the underlying interest rates would have increased the fair value of devon s interest rate swaps by million 
the above sensitivity analysis for interest rate risk excludes accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued liabilities because of the short term maturity of such instruments 
foreign currency risk devon s net assets  net earnings and cash flows from its canadian subsidiaries are based on the us dollar equivalent of such amounts measured in the canadian dollar functional currency 
assets and liabilities of the canadian subsidiaries are translated to us dollars using the applicable exchange rate as of the end of a reporting period 
revenues  expenses and cash flow are translated using the average exchange rate during the reporting period 
as a result of the anderson acquisition  devon s canadian subsidiary  devon canada  assumed million of fixed rate long term debt that is denominated in us dollars 
changes in the currency conversion rate between the canadian and us dollars between the beginning and end of a reporting period increase or decrease the expected amount of canadian dollars required to repay the notes 
the amount of such increase or decrease is required to be included in determining net earnings for the period in which the exchange rate changes 
a decrease in the canadian to us dollar exchange rate would cause devon to record a charge of approximately million in the million becomes due in march until then  the gains or losses caused by the exchange rate fluctuations have no effect on cash flow 
devon assumed certain foreign currency exchange rate swaps in the anderson acquisition 
a portion of devon s canadian gas sales are based on us dollar prices 
therefore  currency fluctuations between the canadian and us dollars impacts the amount of canadian dollars received by devon s canadian subsidiaries for this gas production 
these foreign currency exchange rate swaps mitigate the effect of volatility in the canadian to us dollar exchange rate on canadian gas revenues 
under these swap agreements  in  devon will sell million at average canadian to us exchange rates of  and buy the same amount of dollars at the floating exchange rate 
the amount of gains or losses realized from such swaps are included as increases or decreases to realized gas sales 
at the december  exchange rate  these swaps would result in a decrease to gas sales during of approximately million 
a further decrease in the canadian to us dollar exchange rate would result in an additional decrease to gas sales of approximately million 
for purposes of the sensitivity analysis described above for changes in the canadian dollar exchange rate  a change in the rate of was used as opposed to a change in the rate 
during the last ten years  the canadian to us dollar exchange rate has fluctuated an average of approximately per year  and no year s fluctuation was greater than 
the change used in the above analysis represents an approximate change in the year end rate
