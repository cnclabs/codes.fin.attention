other matters critical accounting policies the company s financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies  which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
management believes that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of accounting policies that currently affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
finance receivable securitizations the company sells retail installment motorcycle loans through securitization transactions utilizing qualifying special purpose entities 
upon sale of retail installment loans in a securitization transaction  hdfs receives cash and retains interest only strip receivables  servicing rights  and cash reserve account deposits  all of which are collectively referred to as retained interests in the securitized receivables 
retained interests are carried at fair value and periodically reviewed for impairment 
market value quotes are generally not available for retained interests  therefore hdfs estimates fair value based on the present value of future expected cash flows using management s best estimates of the key assumptions for credit losses  prepayment speeds and discount rates 
the impact of changes to key assumptions is shown in note of the consolidated financial statements 
gains on current year securitizations from the sale of retail installment loans are recorded as a component of financial services income and are based in part on certain assumptions including expected credit losses  prepayment speed  and discount rates 
gain on sale also depends in part on the original carrying amount of the retail installment loans  which is allocated between the assets sold and the retained interests based on their relative fair value at the date of transfer 
finance receivable credit losses the allowance for uncollectible accounts is maintained at a level management believes is adequate to cover the losses of principal and accrued interest in the existing finance receivables portfolio 
management s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is generally based on hdfs past loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  current economic conditions  specific borrower s ability to repay  and the estimated value of any underlying collateral 
pensions and other postretirement benefits pension projected benefit obligations and costs are developed from actuarial valuations 
the projected benefit obligation represents the actuarial present value of benefits based on service rendered using an assumption as to future compensation levels 
the valuation of projected benefit obligations and costs relies on key assumptions including discount rates  expected return on plan assets and future compensation 
the company evaluates and updates these assumptions annually in conjunction with its september actuarial measurement date 
during the company responded to market conditions by lowering its discount rate assumption from to and lowering its expected rate of return on plan assets assumption from to 
based on these assumptions and others  the projected benefit obligation for pension plans was million as of september  and the fair value of plan assets was million  as of september  during the fourth quarter of the company contributed an additional million to the plan assets  resulting in total contributions of million during the fair value of plan assets was approximately million as of december  postretirement obligations and costs are also developed from actuarial valuations and rely on key assumptions including discount rate and medical trend rate 
consistent with its decision to revise the discount rate for pension serpa plan obligations the company also lowered its discount rate assumption for postretierment healthcare benefits from to 
the postretirement obligation was million as of september  off balance sheet arrangements as part of its securitization program  hdfs transfers retail installment loans to a special purpose bankruptcy remote wholly owned subsidiary 
the subsidiary sells the retail installment loans to a securitization trust in exchange for the proceeds from asset backed securities issued by the securitization trust 
the asset backed securities  usually notes with various maturities and interest rates  are secured by future collections of the purchased retail installment loans 
activities of the securitization trust are limited to acquiring retail installment loans  issuing asset backed securities and making payments on securities to investors 
due to the nature of the assets held by the securitization trust and the limited nature of its activities  the securitization trusts are considered qualifying special purpose entities qspes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
in accordance with sfas no 
 assets and liabilities of the qspes are not consolidated in the financial statements of hdfs 
hdfs does not guarantee securities issued by the securitization trusts 
recourse against hdfs related to each securitization transaction is limited to the respective investment in retained securitization interests 
total investment in retained securitization interests at december  is million 
the securitization trusts have a limited life and generally terminate upon final distribution of amounts owed to the investors in the asset backed securities

the adoption of this standard had no impact on the company s financial statements
