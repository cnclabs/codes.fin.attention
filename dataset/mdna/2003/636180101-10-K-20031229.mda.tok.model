item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
back to table of contents results of operation critical accounting policies the company has prepared its consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
the following is a summary of the company s most critical accounting policies  which are defined as those policies whereby judgments or uncertainties could affect the application of those policies and materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
for a complete discussion of the company s significant accounting policies  refer to item at note a summary of significant accounting policies 
oil and gas exploration and development costs 
in the company s exploration and production segment  oil and gas property acquisition  exploration and development costs are capitalized under the full cost method of accounting 
under this accounting methodology  all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration and development activities are capitalized  including internal costs directly identified with acquisition  exploration and development activities 
the internal costs that are capitalized do not include any costs related to production  general corporate overhead  or similar activities 
the company believes that determining the amount of the company s proved reserves is a critical accounting estimate 
proved reserves are estimated quantities of reserves that  based on geologic and engineering data  appear with reasonable certainty to be producible under existing economic and operating conditions 
such estimates of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and may be subject to substantial revisions as a result of numerous factors including  but not limited to  additional development activity  evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
the estimates involved in determining proved reserves are critical accounting estimates because they serve as the basis over which capitalized costs are depleted under the full cost method of accounting on a units of production basis 
unevaluated properties are excluded from depletion until it is determined whether or not there are proved reserves that can be assigned to these properties 
once it is determined whether there are proved reserves or not  these costs are transferred to the pool of costs being depleted 
in addition to depletion under the units of production method  proved reserves are a major component in the securities and exchange commission sec full cost ceiling test 
the full cost ceiling test is an impairment test prescribed by sec regulation s x rule the ceiling test is performed on a country by country basis and determines a limit  or ceiling  to the amount of property acquisition  exploration and development costs that can be capitalized 
the ceiling under this test represents a the present value of estimated future net revenues using a discount factor of  which is computed by applying current market prices of oil and gas as adjusted for hedging to estimated future production of proved oil and gas reserves as of the date of the latest balance sheet less estimated future expenditures  plus b the cost of unevaluated properties not being depleted  less c income taxes 
the estimates of future production and future expenditures are based on internal budgets that reflect planned production from current wells and expenditures necessary to sustain such future production 
the amount of the ceiling can fluctuate significantly from period to period because of additions or subtractions to proved reserves and significant fluctuations in oil and gas prices 
the ceiling is then compared to the capitalized cost of oil and gas properties less accumulated depletion and related deferred income taxes 
if the capitalized costs of oil and gas properties less accumulated depletion and related deferred taxes exceeds the ceiling at the end of any fiscal quarter  a non cash impairment must be recorded to write down the book value of the reserves to their present value 
this non cash impairment cannot be reversed at a later date if the ceiling increases 
it should also be noted that a non cash impairment to write down the book value of the reserves to their present value in any given period causes a reduction in future depletion expense 
the company recorded non cash impairments relating to its canadian properties in and the impairments in amounted to million after tax and resulted from downward revisions to crude oil reserves related to the canadian properties sold as well as a decline in crude oil prices subsequent to march  the impairment in amounted to million after tax and resulted from low oil and gas prices at september  it is difficult to predict what factors could lead to future impairments under the sec s full cost ceiling test 
as discussed above  fluctuations or subtractions to proved reserves and significant fluctuations in oil and gas prices have an impact on the amount of the ceiling at any point in time 
regulation 
the company is subject to regulation by certain state and federal authorities 
the company  in its utility and pipeline and storage segments  has accounting policies which conform to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the effect of certain types of regulation and which are in accordance with the accounting requirements and ratemaking practices of the regulatory authorities 
the application of these accounting policies allows the company to defer expenses and income on the balance sheet as regulatory assets and liabilities when it is probable that those expenses and income will be allowed in the ratesetting process in a period different from the period in which they would have been reflected in the income statement by an unregulated company 
these deferred regulatory assets and liabilities are then flowed through the income statement in the period in which the same amounts are reflected in rates 
management s assessment of the probability of recovery or pass through of regulatory assets and liabilities requires judgment and interpretation of laws and regulatory commission orders 
if  for any reason  the company ceases to meet the criteria for application of regulatory accounting treatment for all or part of its operations  the regulatory assets and liabilities related to those portions ceasing to meet such criteria would be eliminated from the balance sheet and included in the income statement for the period in which the discontinuance of regulatory accounting treatment occurs 
such amounts would be classified as an extraordinary item 
for further discussion of the company s regulatory assets and liabilities  refer to item at note b regulatory matters 
accounting for derivative financial instruments 
the company  in its exploration and production segment  energy marketing segment  pipeline and storage segment and all other category  uses a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage a portion of the market risk associated with fluctuations in the price of natural gas and crude oil 
these instruments are categorized as price swap agreements  no cost collars  options and futures contracts 
the company  in its pipeline and storage segment  uses an interest rate collar to eliminate interest rate fluctuations on certain variable rate debt 
in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  the company accounts for these instruments as effective cash flow hedges or fair value hedges 
as such  gains or losses associated with the derivative financial instruments are matched with gains or losses resulting from the underlying physical transaction that is being hedged 
to the extent that the derivative financial instruments would ever be deemed to be ineffective  gains or losses from the derivative financial instruments would be marked to market on the income statement without regard to an underlying physical transaction 
the company uses both exchange traded and non exchange traded derivative financial instruments 
the fair value of the non exchange traded derivative financial instruments are based on valuations determined by the counterparties 
refer to the market risk sensitive instruments section in item  md a for further discussion of the company s derivative financial instruments 
pension and other post retirement benefits 
the amounts reported in the company s financial statements related to its pension and other post retirement benefits are determined on an actuarial basis  which uses many assumptions in the calculation of such amounts 
these assumptions include the discount rate  the expected return on plan assets  the rate of compensation increase and  for other post retirement benefits  the expected annual rate of increase in per capita cost of covered medical and prescription benefits 
changes in actuarial assumptions and actuarial experience could have a material impact on the amount of pension and post retirement benefit costs and funding requirements experienced by the company 
however  the company expects to recover substantially all of its net periodic pension and other post retirement benefit costs attributable to employees in its utility and pipeline and storage segments in accordance with the applicable regulatory commission authorization 
for financial reporting purposes  the difference between the amounts of pension cost and post retirement benefit cost recoverable in rates and the amounts of such costs as determined under applicable accounting principles is recorded as either a regulatory asset or liability  as appropriate  as discussed above under regulation 
earnings compared with the company s earnings were million in compared with earnings of million in the increase in earnings of million is primarily the result of higher earnings in the timber  utility  and pipeline and storage segments partially offset by lower earnings in the energy marketing segment and losses in the exploration and production and international segments  as shown in the table below 
this earnings fluctuation is impacted by several events 
in  the company s timber segment completed the sale of approximately  acres of its timber property  recording an after tax gain of million 
also in  the company s exploration and production segment completed the sale of the company s southeast saskatchewan oil and gas properties in canada  recording an after tax loss of million 
the company s exploration and production segment also recorded after tax impairment charges of million related to its canadian oil and gas assets  which is discussed above under critical accounting policies oil and gas exploration and development costs 
earnings for included an impairment in the amount of million  representing the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for goodwill in the company s international segment 
earnings for also included a reduction in the amount of million  representing the cumulative effect of a change in accounting for plugging and abandonment costs in the company s exploration and production segment 
in  earnings included a non cash impairment of the company s investment in the independence pipeline project in the pipeline and storage segment in the amount of million after tax 
for a more complete discussion of the cumulative effect of changes in accounting  refer to note a summary of significant accounting policies in item of this report 
compared with the company s earnings were million in compared with earnings of million in higher earnings in the exploration and production segment and the energy marketing segment were partially offset by lower earnings in the utility and pipeline and storage segments 
the all other category also experienced a lower loss 
as mentioned above  earnings in included a non cash impairment of the company s investment in the independence pipeline project in the pipeline and storage segment in the amount of million after tax 
earnings in included a non cash impairment of oil and gas assets in the exploration and production segment in the amount of million after tax  which is discussed above under critical accounting policies oil and gas exploration and development costs 
these events were the main reasons for lower earnings for the pipeline and storage segment and higher earnings for the exploration and production segment 
additional discussion of earnings in each of the business segments can be found in the business segment information that follows 
earnings loss by segment year ended september thousands utility  pipeline and storage  exploration and production  international  energy marketing  timber  total reportable segments  all other corporate total consolidated  utility revenues utility operating revenues year ended september thousands retail revenues residential  commercial  industrial  off system sales  transportation  other  utility throughput million cubic feet mmcf year ended september retail sales residential  commercial  industrial  off system sales  transportation  compared with operating revenues for the utility segment increased million in compared with this resulted from an increase in retail and off system gas sales revenues of million and million  respectively 
transportation and other revenues also increased by million and million  respectively 
the increase in retail gas sales revenues for the utility segment was largely a function of the recovery of higher gas costs gas costs are recovered dollar for dollar in revenues  coupled with an increase in retail sales volumes  as shown above 
the recovery of higher gas costs resulted from a much higher cost of purchased gas 
see further discussion of purchased gas below under the heading purchased gas 
the increase in retail sales volumes was primarily the result of colder weather  as shown in the table below 
off system sales revenues increased because of higher gas prices  which more than offset lower volumes 
however  due to profit sharing with retail customers  the margins resulting from off system sales were minimal 
colder weather also caused transportation revenues and volumes to increase 
the increase in other operating revenues is largely related to a three year rate settlement approved by the state of new york public service commission nypsc which ended on september  as part of the three year rate settlement  distribution corporation was allowed to utilize certain refunds from upstream pipeline companies and certain other credits referred to as the cost mitigation reserve to offset certain specific expense items 
in  distribution corporation reversed million of the cost mitigation reserve into other operating revenues  compared to million in in both years  the impact of reversing a portion of the cost mitigation reserve was offset by an equal amount of operation and maintenance expense and interest expense thus there is no earnings impact 
the increase in other operating revenues also reflects a million decrease in refund provisions 
in accordance with the three year rate settlement discussed above  distribution corporation has been recording refund provisions related to a sharing with customers of earnings over a predetermined amount 
the refund provisions associated with this earnings sharing mechanism were million and million in and  respectively 
compared with operating revenues for the utility segment decreased million in compared with this decrease largely resulted from a million decrease in retail gas sales revenues 
off system sales revenues  transportation revenues  and other revenues also decreased by million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in retail gas sales revenues for the utility segment was largely a function of the recovery of lower gas costs resulting from a much lower cost of purchased gas 
see further discussion of purchased gas below under the heading purchased gas 
the decrease also resulted from a decrease in retail sales volumes  as shown above 
warmer weather  as shown in the table below  and a general economic downturn in the utility segment s sales territory were major factors for the decrease in retail sales volumes 
warmer weather and the general economic downturn were also factors in the decrease in transportation revenues and volumes 
the decrease in off system sales revenues was largely due to lower gas prices  which more than offset higher volumes 
the decrease in other revenues primarily reflects estimated refund provisions recorded in and amounting to million and million  respectively  recorded in the utility segment s new york jurisdiction under the earnings sharing mechanism discussed above 
partly offsetting the decreases to revenue discussed above was the positive impact of a lower bill credit in the utility segment s new york jurisdiction 
in connection with a new york rate settlement  the utility s new york customers received a million rate decrease in the form of a bill credit for the november  through march  heating season 
for the november  through march  heating season  the amount of the bill credit was reduced to million 
earnings compared with the utility segment s earnings in were million  an increase of million when compared with the earnings of million in the major factor driving this increase was the impact of colder weather in the utility segment s pennsylvania jurisdiction  which contributed approximately million to the increase in earnings 
the impact of weather on the utility segment s new york rate jurisdiction is tempered by a weather normalization clause wnc 
the wnc  which covers the eight month period from october through may  has had a stabilizing effect on earnings for the new york rate jurisdiction 
in addition  in periods of colder than normal weather  the wnc benefits the utility segment s new york customers 
in  the wnc reduced earnings by approximately million after tax because it was colder than normal in the new york service territory 
for  the wnc preserved earnings of approximately million after tax because it was warmer than normal in the new york service territory 
the remainder of the increase was primarily attributable to lower interest expense  primarily on deferred gas costs which declined approximately million after tax 
compared with the utility segment s earnings in were million  a decrease of million when compared with earnings of million in warmer weather in the pennsylvania jurisdiction decreased earnings in by million 
lower normalized usage per account normalized usage excludes the impact of weather on consumption across the utility segment s service territory due to a downturn in the economy significantly decreased earnings in by million 
also contributing to the decrease were several routine regulatory true up adjustments associated with income taxes  lost and unaccounted for gas and interest expense  all of which decreased earnings by million 
in addition  s earnings included million after tax of income associated with stock appreciation rights and million of after tax expense associated with early retirement offers in the utility segment s new york and pennsylvania jurisdictions 
the impact of the refund provision discussed above was largely offset by lower operation and maintenance expenses  primarily labor 
earnings in benefitted from the impact of the lower bill credit million pre tax and million after tax  discussed above 
in  the wnc preserved earnings of approximately million after tax as weather  overall in the new york service territory  was warmer than normal for the period from october through may in the pennsylvania service territory  which does not have a wnc  weather during was warmer than and warmer than normal 
degree days percent warmer colder than year ended september normal actual normal prior year buffalo   erie   buffalo   erie   buffalo   erie   purchased gas the cost of purchased gas is the company s single largest operating expense 
annual variations in purchased gas costs are attributed directly to changes in gas sales volumes  the price of gas purchased and the operation of purchased gas adjustment clauses 
currently  distribution corporation has contracted for long term firm transportation capacity with supply corporation and six other upstream pipeline companies  for long term gas supplies with a combination of producers and marketers  and for storage service with supply corporation and three nonaffiliated companies 
in addition  distribution corporation satisfies a portion of its gas requirements through spot market purchases 
changes in wellhead prices have a direct impact on the cost of purchased gas 
distribution corporation s average cost of purchased gas  including the cost of transportation and storage  was per thousand cubic feet mcf in  an increase of from the average cost of per mcf in the average cost of purchased gas in was lower than the average cost of per mcf in additional discussion of the utility segment s gas purchases appears under the heading sources and availability of raw materials in item pipeline and storage revenues pipeline and storage operating revenues year ended september thousands firm transportation  interruptible transportation  firm storage service  interruptible storage service other  pipeline and storage throughput mmcf year ended september firm transportation  interruptible transportation  compared with operating revenues for the pipeline and storage segment increased million in as compared with for  the acquisition of empire state pipeline empire from duke energy corporation on february  was a significant factor contributing to the revenue increase 
for the period of february  to september   empire recorded operating revenues of million million in firm transportation revenues  million in interruptible transportation revenues and million in other revenues 
another factor contributing to the increase in operating revenues in the pipeline and storage segment was a million increase in revenues from unbundled pipeline sales and open access transportation included in other revenues in the table above 
the increase in revenues from unbundled pipeline sales and open access transportation primarily reflects higher natural gas commodity prices 
while transportation volumes increased during the year  volume fluctuations generally do not have a significant impact on revenues as a result of supply corporation s straight fixed variable rate design 
compared with operating revenues for the pipeline and storage segment decreased million in as compared with for  the decrease resulted primarily from a million decrease in transportation revenues  as shown in the table above  and a million decrease in cashout revenues included in other revenues in the table above 
cashout revenues represent a cash resolution of a gas imbalance whereby a customer pays supply corporation for gas the customer receives in excess of amounts delivered into supply corporation s system by the customer s shipper 
cashout revenues are offset by purchased gas expense 
the decrease in transportation revenues primarily reflects lower gathering rates the rates charged by supply corporation to its transportation customers to move gas from a third party well site or nearby meter to supply corporation s transmission pipelines for delivery as a result of a provision in a february settlement with ferc that ended in however  this rate decrease is largely offset by a reduction in amortization expense  thus having little impact on net income 
another impact of this settlement was that supply corporation no longer had the responsibility to process gas for local producers 
as such  there was a reduction in gas processing revenues 
however  this reduction was offset by higher revenues from unbundled pipeline sales and open access transportation 
both gas processing revenues and revenues from unbundled pipeline sales and open access transportation are included in other revenues in the table above 
while transportation volumes decreased during the year  volume fluctuations generally do not have a significant impact on revenues as a result of supply corporation s straight fixed variable rate design 
earnings compared with the pipeline and storage segment s earnings in were million  an increase of million when compared with earnings of million in a major factor in the earnings increase was the fact that included an after tax impairment charge of million million pre tax related to the company s investment in independence pipeline company a partnership discontinued in that had proposed to construct and operate a mile pipeline to transport natural gas from defiance  ohio to leidy  pennsylvania 
higher revenues from unbundled pipeline sales and open access transportation million after tax were also a contributor to the earnings increase 
the empire acquisition in february contributed million to earnings 
compared with the pipeline and storage segment s earnings in were million  a decrease of million when compared with earnings of million in as discussed above  the earnings for included a million after tax impairment charge associated with the company s investment in independence pipeline company 
other factors contributing to the decrease included million of earnings associated with stock appreciation rights recorded in and million of earnings in associated with a termination fee received from a customer to cancel a long term transportation contract 
these decreases were partially offset by the fact that included million of after tax expense associated with early retirement offers 
aside from the decrease in operation and maintenance expense associated with the early retirement offers in  the pipeline and storage segment also experienced operation and maintenance expense savings in of million after tax 
a lower effective tax rate in compared to also helped to reduce the earnings decrease in by million 
exploration and production revenues exploration and production operating revenues year ended september thousands gas after hedging  oil after hedging  gas processing plant  other  intrasegment elimination  represents the elimination of certain west coast gas production revenue in cluded in gas after hedging in the table above that is sold to the gas processing plant show n in the table above 
an elimination for the same dollar amount is made to reduce the gas processin g plant s purchased gas expense 
production volumes year ended september gas production mmcf gulf coast  west coast  appalachia  canada  oil production mbbl gulf coast  west coast  appalachia canada  average prices year ended september average gas price mcf gulf coast west coast appalachia canada weighted average weighted average after hedging average oil price barrel bbl gulf coast west coast appalachia canada weighted average weighted average after hedging refer to further discussion of hedging activities below under market risk sensitive instruments and in note e financial instruments in item of this report 
includes low gravity oil which generally sells for a lower price 
compared with operating revenues for the exploration and production segment decreased million in as compared with oil production revenue after hedging decreased million due to a  barrel decline in production offset partly by higher weighted average prices after hedging per barrel 
gas production revenue after hedging increased million 
increases in the weighted average price of gas after hedging per mcf more than offset an overall decrease in gas production 
most of the decrease in gas production occurred in the gulf coast of mexico a  mmcf decline 
the company had anticipated some of this decline in gas and oil production due to its plan to phase out of the gulf coast region 
other factors in the overall production decrease included an outside operated offshore pipeline leak that required four key producing blocks to be shut in for ten days  and a decline in drilling activity in canada related to a decision to sell the company s southeast saskatchewan oil properties  which is discussed below 
also  earlier in the year certain production in the gulf coast region was shut in during hurricane lili and some of those wells are not expected to return to pre hurricane production levels 
gas processing plant revenues increased million due to higher gas prices because there is a similar increase in purchased gas expense  the impact on earnings is insignificant 
other revenues decreased million largely due to the exploration and production segment experiencing negative mark to market adjustments on derivative financial instruments of million during compared to positive mark to market adjustments on derivative financial instruments of million in refer to further discussion of derivative financial instruments in the market risk sensitive instruments section that follows 
refer to the tables above for production and price information 
compared with operating revenues for the exploration and production segment decreased million in as compared with oil production revenue after hedging decreased million due primarily to a per bbl decrease in the weighted average price of oil after hedging 
gas production revenue after hedging  decreased million 
decreases in the weighted average price of gas after hedging per mcf more than offset an overall increase in gas production 
the overall increase in gas production is largely attributable to the canadian properties acquired in june ie  the player petroleum corporation acquisition player offset partially by decreased production in the gulf coast region 
as discussed above  the plan to phase out of the gulf coast region contributed to this decrease in oil and gas production 
gas processing plant revenues decreased million due to significantly lower gas prices 
other revenues decreased million largely due to mark to market gains on derivative financial instruments that were recorded in earnings compared with the exploration and production segment experienced a loss of million in  a decrease of million when compared with earnings of million in the main reason for this decrease was the loss of million recorded upon the sale of the company s southeast saskatchewan oil and gas properties 
during  the company reviewed the economics of its non regulated business including certain oil and gas properties 
the southeast saskatchewan properties were identified as a candidate for sale given their overall marginal contribution to earnings 
the sale of these properties is expected to reduce the exploration and production segment s oil and gas production in canada by approximately  mbbl and mmcf  respectively 
however  the impact to earnings is expected to be minimal as lower production revenues will be offset by lower depletion expense 
after tax impairment charges of million recorded in related to the company s canadian oil and gas assets also contributed to the decrease 
lower oil and gas revenues  as discussed above  decreased earnings by approximately million 
as an offset  the exploration and production segment experienced lower depletion expense of million attributable to the production decline and lower general and administrative expenses of million attributable to cost cutting efforts in canada 
another offsetting factor was a lower effective income tax rate  which benefitted earnings by approximately million 
compared with the exploration and production segment s earnings in were million  an increase of million when compared with a loss of million in a major reason for the increase was that earnings included a non cash impairment of this segment s oil and gas assets totaling million after tax  as previously discussed 
partially offsetting this positive impact was a decline in oil and gas revenues  which decreased earnings by approximately million  due to lower weighted average commodity prices of crude oil and natural gas after hedging due to an increase in workover expenses per bbl and per mcf  respectively 
also  the decrease in other revenues associated with mark to market gains recorded in  as discussed above  reduced earnings by million 
higher lease operating expenses in the gulf coast region  due to an increase in workover expenses  also reduced earnings by approximately million 
the major workover expenditures occurred on vermilion and eugene island block international revenues international operating revenues year ended september thousands heating  electricity  other  international heating and electric volumes year ended september heating sales gigajoules  electricity sales megawatt hours  gigajoules one billion joules 
a joule is a unit of energy 
compared with operating revenues for the international segment increased million in as compared with substantially all of this increase can be attributed to an increase in the value of the czech koruna czk compared to the us dollar 
compared with operating revenues for the international segment decreased million in as compared with the decrease in heat revenues in compared to reflects the june sale of jablonecka teplarenska a realitni  as a district heating plant located in the czech republic which had heating revenues of million in  and heating volumes of  gigajoules in 
it also reflects the impact of weather in the czech republic  which was warmer in than in the prior year 
however  an increase in the average value of the czk compared to the us dollar offset much of the impact of these negative factors 
earnings compared with the international segment experienced a loss of million in compared with a loss of million in this decrease can be attributed primarily to an million impairment charge  resulting from the company s change in accounting for goodwill 
the company s goodwill balance as of october  totaled million and was related to the company s investments in the czech republic  which are included in the international segment 
in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  the company stopped amortization of goodwill and tested its goodwill for impairment as of october  the company used discounted cash flows to estimate the fair value of its goodwill at october  and determined that the goodwill had no remaining value 
based on projected restructuring in the czech electricity market  the company cannot be assured that the level of future cash flows from the company s investments in the czech republic will attain the level that was originally forecasted 
in accordance with sfas  this impairment was reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting in the quarter ending december  partially offsetting the negative impact of the impairment  an increase in the value of the czk compared to the us dollar reduced the loss by approximately million 
lower operating costs at the us level primarily lower project development costs and pension costs further reduced the loss by approximately million 
compared with the international segment experienced a loss of million in compared with a loss of million in higher operation and maintenance expense of approximately million after tax  largely associated with the company s european power development projects  was the main factor in the higher loss in lower interest expense of approximately million after tax  and a higher effective tax rate the impact of which was approximately million partially offset the impact of higher operation and maintenance expenses 
energy marketing revenues energy marketing operating revenues year ended september thousands natural gas after hedging  electricity other energy marketing volumes year ended september natural gas mmcf  compared with operating revenues for the energy marketing segment increased million in  as compared with this increase primarily reflects higher gas sales revenue due to higher natural gas commodity prices 
higher volumes  which were principally the result of the addition of several high volume customers and colder weather  also contributed to the increase in operating revenues 
compared with operating revenues for the energy marketing segment decreased million in  as compared with this decrease was primarily the result of lower natural gas commodity prices that were recovered through revenues 
lower volumes  which were principally the result of warmer weather  also contributed to the decrease in operating revenues 
earnings compared with the energy marketing segment earnings in were million  a decrease of million when compared with earnings of million in this decrease primarily reflects lower margins on gas sales  primarily due to end of winter local distribution company operational constraints  combined with price volatility and weather related demand swings 
compared with the energy marketing segment earnings in were million  an increase of million when compared with a loss of million in this increase primarily reflects higher margins on gas sales and lower interest and operation and maintenance expenses 
margins increased as a result of improved operational strategies put in place by the energy marketing segment s new management team 
timber revenues timber operating revenues year ended september thousands log sales  green lumber sales  kiln dry lumber sales  other timber board feet year ended september thousands log sales  green lumber sales  kiln dry lumber sales  compared with operating revenues for the timber segment increased million in  as compared with the increase can largely be attributed to higher sales of cherry veneer logs that command higher than average prices 
higher kiln dry lumber sales also contributed to the increase 
partially offsetting the increase in log sales and kiln dry lumber sales  other revenues decreased million primarily because included a million gain on the sale of standing timber 
compared with operating revenues for the timber segment increased million in  as compared with when comparing to  log sales decreased million as weather that was warmer and wetter than normal during the first and second quarters of hampered the ability to cut and haul logs  specifically cherry veneer logs 
the company made up for this lost revenue through higher sales of lumber 
green lumber sales increased million and kiln dry lumber sales increased million mostly due to an increase in kiln dry cherry volumes 
earnings compared with the timber segment earnings in were million  an increase of million when compared with earnings of million in the increase was primarily due to the sale of approximately  acres of timber properties on august  for approximately million 
as a result of the sale  the company recorded an after tax gain of approximately million 
the company decided to sell the timber property as a means of financing its acquisition of empire  which is discussed below under capital resources and liquidity investing cash flow timber 
earnings from the timber segment exclusive of the million after tax gain referred to above are expected to decline in due to the fact that a greater portion of timber sales will be made from higher cost basis properties 
in prior fiscal years  sales from lower cost basis properties a large portion of which were sold in represented a more significant percentage of total timber sales 
after the august sale  the company had approximately  acres of timber property remaining 
compared with the timber segment earnings in were million  an increase of million when compared with earnings of million in the increase was primarily due to higher operating revenues  as mentioned above  and lower interest expense 
the increase in operating revenues was primarily due to an increase in kiln dry cherry lumber sales volumes 
corporate and all other operations compared with corporate and all other operations had earnings of million in  an increase of million when compared with a loss of million in earnings increased largely due to lower interest and operation costs 
compared with corporate and all other operations experienced a loss of million in  an improvement of million over the loss of million in the loss for included million of earnings associated with stock appreciation rights and million of after tax expense associated with a mark to market loss on natural gas inventory by upstate  the company s wholly owned subsidiary which was engaged in wholesale natural gas marketing and other energy related activities in as noted in item  upstate is currently engaged primarily in the purchase  sale and transportation of landfill gas 
operations of unconsolidated subsidiaries the company s unconsolidated subsidiaries consist of equity method investments in seneca energy ii  llc seneca energy  model city energy  llc model city and energy systems north east  llc esne 
the company has a ownership interest in each of these entities 
seneca energy and model city generate and sell electricity using methane gas obtained from landfills owned by outside parties 
esne generates electricity from an megawatt  combined cycle  natural gas fired power plant in north east  pennsylvania 
esne sells its electricity into the new york power grid 
the company also had a equity method investment in independence pipeline company which was written off in  as previously discussed 
the write off of million million after tax is recorded on the consolidated statement of income as impairment of investment in partnership 
compared with income from unconsolidated subsidiaries which represents the company s equity method interest in the income or loss from its investment in unconsolidated subsidiaries increased million in compared with the improvement can largely be attributed to increases in income from the company s investments in seneca energy million and model city million 
higher electric generation revenues and lower repair and maintenance expenditures on the generating engines were the main factors for the seneca energy and model city increases 
partially offsetting these positive contributions  the esne investment experienced higher losses in compared to million 
esne experienced lower electric generation revenues in compared to  largely due to the fact that the spring and summer of was not as warm as the spring and summer of esne generates most of its electricity during the spring and summer months when electricity demand peaks for air conditioning requirements 
compared with income from unconsolidated subsidiaries decreased million in compared with this decrease is largely attributable to losses experienced by the esne investment during of million compared to income in the prior year of million 
esne was formed on april  so income for did not reflect any of the normal operating losses that esne incurs during the fall and winter months 
esne generates most of its electricity during the spring and summer months when electricity demand peaks for air conditioning requirements 
esne experienced higher electric generation revenues in the spring and summer of compared with the same period in the seneca energy investment also experienced an earnings decrease of million due to lower electric generation revenues and higher repair and maintenance expenditures on the generating engines 
other income and interest charges although most of the variances in other income items and interest charges are discussed in the earnings discussion by segment above  following is a summary on a consolidated basis other income other income decreased million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease in resulted primarily from a million termination fee received in from a customer in the pipeline and storage segment to cancel a long term transportation contract 
the company was able to market the excess capacity resulting from this termination 
interest charges interest on long term debt increased million in and million in the increase in both years resulted mainly from a higher average amount of long term debt outstanding which more than offset lower weighted average interest rates 
other interest charges decreased million in and million in the decrease in both years was primarily the result of lower weighted average interest rates on short term debt combined with a lower average amount of short term debt outstanding 
capital resources and liquidity the primary sources and uses of cash during the last three years are summarized in the following condensed statement of cash flows sources uses of cash year ended september millions provided by operating activities capital expenditures investment in subsidiaries  net of cash acquired investment in partnerships net proceeds from sale of timber properties net proceeds from sale of oil and gas producing properties other investing activities short term debt  net change long term debt  net change issuance of common stock dividends paid on common stock effect of exchange rates on cash net increase decrease in cash and temporary cash investments operating cash flow internally generated cash from operating activities consists of net income available for common stock  adjusted for noncash expenses  noncash income and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
noncash items include depreciation  depletion and amortization  impairment of oil and gas producing properties in and  deferred income taxes  impairment of investment in partnership in  income or loss from unconsolidated subsidiaries net of cash distributions  minority interest in foreign subsidiaries  gain on sale of timber properties  loss on sale of oil and gas producing properties and cumulative effect of changes in accounting 
cash provided by operating activities in the utility and pipeline and storage segments may vary substantially from year to year because of the impact of rate cases 
in the utility segment  supplier refunds  over or under recovered purchased gas costs and weather also significantly impact cash flow 
the impact of weather on cash flow is tempered in the utility segment s new york rate jurisdiction by its wnc and in the pipeline and storage segment by supply corporation s straight fixed variable rate design 
cash provided by operating activities in the exploration and production segment may vary from period to period as a result of changes in the commodity prices of natural gas and crude oil 
the company uses various derivative financial instruments  including price swap agreements  no cost collars and futures contracts in an attempt to manage this energy commodity price risk 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million in  a decrease of million compared with the million provided by operating activities in higher working capital requirements in the utility and energy marketing segments were the main reasons for this decrease 
these decreases were partially offset by higher cash from operations in the exploration and production segment 
investing cash flow expenditures for long lived assets expenditures for long lived assets include additions to property  plant and equipment capital expenditures and investments in corporations stock acquisitions or partnerships  net of any cash acquired 
the company s expenditures for long lived assets totaled million in the table below presents these expenditures total investments expenditures capital in corporations for long year ended september  millions expenditures or partnerships lived assets utility pipeline and storage exploration and production international energy marketing timber all other and corporate investment amount is net of million of cash acquired 
investment amount is net of million of cash acquired 
utility the majority of the utility capital expenditures were made for replacement of mains and main extensions  as well as for the replacement of service lines 
pipeline and storage the majority of the pipeline and storage segment s capital expenditures were made for additions  improvements and replacements to this segment s transmission and gas storage systems 
on february   the company acquired the empire state pipeline empire from a subsidiary of duke energy corporation for million in cash including cash acquired plus million of project debt 
the acquisition  which was made through highland a direct subsidiary having timber property and sawmill operations in new york and pennsylvania  consisted of acquiring of two companies 
each of these companies had ownership of empire  which is a joint venture 
empire s results of operations were incorporated into the company s consolidated financial statements for the period subsequent to the completion of the acquisition on february  empire is a mile  inch pipeline that begins at the united states canadian border at the niagara river near buffalo  new york  which is within the company s service territory  and terminates in central new york just north of syracuse  new york 
empire has almost all of its capacity under contract  with a substantial portion being long term contracts 
refer to item  the pipeline and storage segment for a discussion of empire s transportation capacity 
empire delivers natural gas supplies to major industrial companies  utilities including the company s utility segment and power producers 
empire better positions the company to bring canadian gas supplies into the east coast markets of the united states as demand for natural gas along the east coast increases 
the initial financing of the acquisition was accomplished through short term borrowings 
these short term borrowings were repaid when the company completed the sale of  acres of timber property on august  the sale of this timber property is discussed below under timber 
exploration and production the exploration and production segment s capital expenditures included approximately million of capital expenditures for on shore drilling  construction and recompletion costs for wells located in louisiana  texas  california and canada as well as on shore geological and geophysical costs and fixed asset purchases 
of the million discussed above  million was spent on the exploration and production segment s canadian properties 
the exploration and production segment s capital expenditures also included approximately million for its off shore program in the gulf of mexico  including offshore drilling expenditures  offshore construction  lease acquisition costs and geological and geophysical expenditures 
during  the company spent million included in the amounts above developing proved undeveloped reserves 
in september  the company sold its southeast saskatchewan oil and gas properties in canada for approximately million as previously discussed 
the company used the proceeds from the sale to repay short term borrowings 
international the majority of the international segment s capital expenditures were concentrated in improvements and replacements within the district heating and power generation plants in the czech republic 
timber the majority of the timber segment s capital expenditures were for purchases of timber  as well as equipment and vehicles for this segment s sawmill and kiln operations 
as discussed above  the company sold approximately  acres of its timber property located in various counties in pennsylvania and allegany county in new york in august the sale price was approximately million 
the company recorded a pre tax gain on this sale of approximately million million after tax 
the company used the proceeds from this sale to repay short term borrowings in connection with the empire acquisition 
the remaining capital expenditures were for smaller purchases of land and timber for seneca s timber operations as well as equipment for highland s sawmill and kiln operations 
all other and corporate the majority of the all other and corporate capital expenditures were for capital improvements to the company s new corporate headquarters 
on june   the company acquired for approximately million in cash including cash acquired of million all of the partnership interests in toro partners  lp toro  limited partnership which owns and operates eight short distance landfill gas pipeline companies that purchase  transport and resell landfill gas to customers in six states located primarily in the midwestern united states 
toro s results of operations were incorporated into the company s consolidated financial statements for the period subsequent to the completion of the acquisition on june  the existing landfill gas purchase and sale agreements at these facilities remained in place 
the company believes there are opportunities for expansion at many of these locations 
in may  the company made a capital contribution of million to seneca energy 
this capital contribution was related to the expansion of seneca energy s electric generation facilities to a new site at a landfill in ontario county  new york 
estimated capital expenditures the company s estimated capital expenditures for the next three years are year ended september millions utility pipeline and storage exploration and production international timber all other includes estimated expenditures for the years ended september   and of approximately million  million and million  respectiv ely  to develop proved undeveloped reserves 
estimated capital expenditures for the utility segment in will be concentrated in the areas of main and service line improvements and replacements and  to a minor extent  the installation of new services 
estimated capital expenditures for the pipeline and storage segment in will be concentrated in the reconditioning of storage wells and the replacement of storage and transmission lines 
the company also continues to explore various opportunities to expand its capabilities to transport gas to the east coast  either through the supply corporation or empire systems or in partnership with others 
this includes the northwinds pipeline that the company and transcanada pipelines limited have proposed 
this project presently contemplates a mile  inch natural gas pipeline that would originate in kirkwall  ontario  cross into the united states near buffalo  new york and follow a southerly route to its destination in the ellisburg leidy area in pennsylvania 
at september   the company had incurred approximately million in costs all of which have been expensed associated with this project 
the initial capacity of the pipeline would be approximately million cubic feet of natural gas per day with the estimated cost of the pipeline ranging from million to million 
if the pipeline is constructed  it is possible that a significant amount of the construction costs would be financed by banks or other financial institutions with the pipeline serving as collateral for the financing arrangement 
estimated capital expenditures in for the exploration and production segment include approximately million for canada  million for the gulf coast region million on the off shore program in the gulf of mexico  million for the west coast region and million for the appalachian region 
the estimated capital expenditures for the international segment in will be concentrated on improvements and replacements within the district heating and power generation plants in the czech republic 
the estimated capital expenditures do not include any expenditures for the company s european power development projects 
currently  any costs incurred on these power development projects are expensed 
the company s european power development projects are primarily in italy and bulgaria 
in italy  the company has signed a joint development agreement with an italian utility for the construction of a megawatt combined cycle natural gas fired electric generating plant 
the estimated cost of this project is million to million 
in bulgaria  the company is pursuing the opportunity to construct  own and operate two new megawatt gas fired combustion turbines 
the estimated cost of this project is million to million 
whether the company moves forward to construct these projects will depend on successful negotiation of various operating agreements as well as the availability of funds from banks or other financial institutions to cover a significant amount of the construction costs 
the respective projects would serve as collateral for such financing arrangements 
estimated capital expenditures in the timber segment will be concentrated on the construction or purchase of new facilities and equipment for this segment s sawmill and kiln operations 
the estimated capital expenditures in the all other category in will be concentrated on the purchase and installation of a gas turbine and steam turbine by horizon power to create a megawatt facility in buffalo  new york 
the company continuously evaluates capital expenditures and investments in corporations and partnerships 
the amounts are subject to modification for opportunities such as the acquisition of attractive oil and gas properties  timber or storage facilities and the expansion of transmission line capacities 
while the majority of capital expenditures in the utility segment are necessitated by the continued need for replacement and upgrading of mains and service lines  the magnitude of future capital expenditures or other investments in the company s other business segments depends  to a large degree  upon market conditions 
financing cash flow in february  the company issued million of long term notes due in march after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions  the net proceeds to the company amounted to approximately million 
the proceeds of this debt issuance were used to refund million of medium term notes which matured in february the remaining proceeds were used to reduce short term borrowings 
in march  the company redeemed million of medium term notes at a redemption price of million 
the company also redeemed million of medium term notes in march at a redemption price of million 
the company used short term borrowings to redeem this debt 
consolidated short term debt decreased million during proceeds of million received from the sale of the company s southeast saskatchewan oil and gas properties were used to reduce short term debt  as previously discussed 
the other major factors contributing to the fluctuation in short term debt were the issuance of long term debt in february and the redemption of long term debt in march  both of which are discussed above 
the company continues to consider short term debt consisting of short term notes payable to banks and commercial paper an important source of cash for temporarily financing capital expenditures and investments in corporations and or partnerships  gas in storage inventory  unrecovered purchased gas costs  exploration and development expenditures and other working capital needs 
fluctuations in these items can have a significant impact on the amount and timing of short term debt 
at september   the company had outstanding short term notes payable to banks and commercial paper of million and million  respectively 
the company has securities and exchange commission sec authorization under the public utility holding company act of  as amended  to borrow and have outstanding as much as million of short term debt at any time through december  as for bank loans  the company maintains a number of individual bi lateral uncommitted or discretionary lines of credit with certain financial institutions for general corporate purposes 
borrowings under these lines of credit are made at competitive market rates 
each of these credit lines  which aggregate to million  are revocable at the option of the financial institutions and are reviewed on an annual basis 
the company anticipates that these lines of credit will continue to be renewed 
the total amount available to be issued under the company s commercial paper program is million 
the commercial paper program is backed by a committed credit facility totaling million 
of that amount  million is committed to the company through september  and million is committed to the company through september  under the company s committed credit facility  the company has agreed that its debt to capitalization ratio will not at the last day of any fiscal quarter  exceed 
from september  through september   
from october  through september  and 
from october  and thereafter 
at september   the company s debt to capitalization ratio as calculated under the facility was 
the constraints specified in the committed credit facility would permit an additional million in short term and or long term debt to be outstanding before the company s debt to capitalization ratio would exceed 
if a downgrade in any of the company s credit ratings were to occur  access to the commercial paper markets might not be possible 
however  the company expects that it could borrow under its uncommitted bank lines of credit or rely upon other liquidity sources  including cash provided by operations 
under the company s existing indenture covenants  at september   the company would have been permitted to issue up to a maximum of million in additional long term unsecured indebtedness at then current market interest rates further limited by the debt to capitalization ratio constraints noted in the previous paragraph in addition to being able to issue new indebtedness to replace maturing debt 
the company s present liquidity position is believed to be adequate to satisfy known demands 
the company s indenture pursuant to which million or of the company s long term debt as of september  was issued contains a cross default provision whereby the failure by the company to perform certain obligations under other borrowing arrangements could trigger an obligation to repay the debt outstanding under the indenture 
in particular  a repayment obligation could be triggered if the company fails i to pay any scheduled principal or interest on any debt under any other indenture or agreement or ii to perform any other term in any other such indenture or agreement  and the effect of the failure causes  or would permit the holders of the debt to cause  the debt to become due prior to its stated maturity  unless cured or waived 
the company s committed million  day year credit facility also contains a cross default provision whereby the failure by the company or its significant subsidiaries to make payments under other borrowing arrangements  or the occurrence of certain events affecting those other borrowing arrangements  could trigger an obligation to repay any amounts outstanding under the committed credit facility 
in particular  a repayment obligation could be triggered if i the company or its significant subsidiaries fail to make a payment when due of any principal or interest on any other indebtedness aggregating million or more or ii an event occurs that causes  or would permit the holders of such indebtedness to cause  such indebtedness to become due prior to its stated maturity 
as of september   the company had no debt outstanding under the committed credit facility 
the company s embedded cost of long term debt was at september  and at september  refer to interest rate risk in this item for a more detailed break down of the company s embedded cost of long term debt 
the company also has authorization from the sec  under the holding company act  to issue long term debt securities and equity securities in an aggregate amount of up to billion during the order s authorization period  which commenced in november and extends to december  in january  the company registered million of debt and equity securities under the securities act of after the february debt issuance discussed above  the company has available capacity to issue an additional million of debt and equity securities registered under the securities act of the company may sell all or a portion of the remaining registered securities if warranted by market conditions and the company s capital requirements 
any offer and sale of the above mentioned million of debt and equity securities will be made only by means of a prospectus meeting the requirements of the securities act of and the rules and regulations thereunder 
the amounts and timing of the issuance and sale of debt or equity securities will depend on market conditions  indenture requirements  regulatory authorizations and the capital requirements of the company 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has entered into certain off balance sheet financing arrangements 
these financing arrangements are primarily operating and capital leases 
the company s consolidated subsidiaries have operating leases  the majority of which are with the utility and the pipeline and storage segments  having a remaining lease commitment of approximately million 
these leases have been entered into for the use of vehicles  construction tools  meters  computer equipment and other items and are accounted for as operating leases 
the company s unconsolidated subsidiaries  which are accounted for under the equity method  have capital leases of electric generating equipment having a remaining lease commitment of approximately million 
the company has guaranteed  or million  of these capital lease commitments 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s expected future contractual cash obligations as of september   and the twelve month periods over which they occur payments by expecte d maturity dates millions thereafter total long term debt short term bank notes commercial paper operating lease commitments capital lease commitments the company has made certain other guarantees on behalf of its subsidiaries 
the guarantees relate primarily to i obligations under derivative financial instruments  which are included on the consolidated balance sheet in accordance with sfas see item  md a under the heading critical accounting policies accounting for derivative financial instruments  ii nfr obligations to purchase gas or to purchase gas transportation storage services where the amounts due on those obligations each month are included on the consolidated balance sheet as a current liability  and iii other obligations which are reflected on the consolidated balance sheet 
the company believes that the likelihood it would be required to make payments under the guarantees is remote  and therefore has not included them on the table above 
other matters the company is involved in litigation arising in the normal course of business 
also in the normal course of business  the company is involved in tax  regulatory and other governmental audits  inspections  investigations and other proceedings that involve state and federal taxes  safety  compliance with regulations  rate base  cost of service and purchased gas cost issues  among other things 
while the resolution of such litigation or regulatory matters could have a material effect on earnings and cash flows in the period of resolution  none of this litigation  and none of these regulatory matters  are expected to change materially the company s present liquidity position  nor have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the company 
the company has a tax qualified  noncontributory defined benefit retirement plan retirement plan that covers substantially all domestic employees of the company 
the company has been making contributions to the retirement plan over the last several years equal to the maximum funding requirements of applicable laws and regulations

the company anticipates that the annual contribution to the retirement plan in will be in the range of million to million 
the company expects that all subsidiaries having domestic employees covered by the retirement plan will make contributions to the retirement plan 
the funding of such contributions will come from amounts collected in rates in the utility and pipeline and storage segments or through short term borrowings or through cash from operations 
market risk sensitive instruments energy commodity price risk the company  in its exploration and production segment  energy marketing segment  pipeline and storage segment  and all other category  uses various derivative financial instruments derivatives  including price swap agreements  no cost collars and futures contracts  as part of the company s overall energy commodity price risk management strategy 
under this strategy  the company manages a portion of the market risk associated with fluctuations in the price of natural gas and crude oil  thereby attempting to provide more stability to operating results 
the company has operating procedures in place that are administered by experienced management to monitor compliance with the company s risk management policies 
the derivatives are not held for trading purposes 
the fair value of these derivatives  as shown below  represents the amount that the company would receive from or pay to the respective counterparties at september  to terminate the derivatives 
however  the tables below and the fair value that is disclosed do not consider the physical side of the natural gas and crude oil transactions that are related to the financial instruments 
the following tables disclose natural gas and crude oil price swap information by expected maturity dates for agreements in which the company receives a fixed price in exchange for paying a variable price as quoted in inside ferc or on the new york mercantile exchange 
notional amounts quantities are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract 
the weighted average variable prices represent the weighted average settlement prices by expected maturity date as of september  at september   the company had not entered into any natural gas or crude oil price swap agreements extending beyond natural gas price swap agreements expected maturity dat es total notional quantities equivalent bcf weighted average fixed rate per mcf weighted average variable rate per mcf crude oil price swap agreements expect ed maturity dates total notional quantities equivalent bbls  weighted average fixed rate per bbl weighted average variable rate per bbl at september   the company would have had to pay its respective counterparties an aggregate of approximately million to terminate the natural gas price swap agreements outstanding at that date 
the company would have had to pay an aggregate of approximately million to its counterparties to terminate the crude oil price swap agreements outstanding at september  at september   the company had natural gas price swap agreements covering bcf at a weighted average fixed rate of per mcf 
the company also had crude oil price swap agreements covering  bbls at a weighted average fixed rate of per bbl 
lower anticipated production in the exploration and production segment is the primary reason for the decrease in price swap agreements from september to september the following table discloses the notional quantities  the weighted average ceiling price and the weighted average floor price for the no cost collars used by the company to manage natural gas and crude oil price risk 
the no cost collars provide for the company to receive monthly payments from or make payments to other parties when a variable price falls below an established floor price the company receives payment from the counterparty or exceeds an established ceiling price the company pays the counterparty

the company may be exposed to credit risk on some of the derivatives disclosed above 
credit risk relates to the risk of loss that the company would incur as a result of nonperformance by counterparties pursuant to the terms of their contractual obligations 
to mitigate such credit risk  management performs a credit check and then  on an ongoing basis  monitors counterparty credit exposure 
management has obtained guarantees from the parent companies of the respective counterparties to its derivative financial instruments 
at september   the company used seven counterparties for its over the counter derivative financial instruments 
at september   no individual counterparty represented greater than of total credit risk measured as volumes hedged by an individual counterparty as a percentage of the company s total volumes hedged 
exchange rate risk the international segment s investment in the czech republic is valued in czech korunas  and  as such  this investment is subject to currency exchange risk when the czech korunas are translated into us dollars 
the exploration and production segment s investment in canada is valued in canadian dollars  and  as such  this investment is subject to currency exchange risk when the canadian dollars are translated into us dollars 
this exchange rate risk to the company s investments in the czech republic and canada results in increases or decreases to the cumulative foreign currency translation adjustment cta  a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the consolidated balance sheet 
when the foreign currency increases in value in relation to the us dollar  there is a positive adjustment to cta 
when the foreign currency decreases in value in relation to the u 
s 
dollar  there is a negative adjustment to cta 
interest rate risk the company s exposure to interest rate risk arises primarily from its borrowing under short term debt instruments 
at september   these instruments consisted of domestic short term bank loans and commercial paper totaling million 
the interest rate on these short term bank loans and commercial paper approximated at september  the following table presents the principal cash repayments and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity date for the company s long term fixed rate debt as well as the other long term debt of certain of the company s subsidiaries

weighted average interest rate excludes the impact of an interest rate coll ar on million of variable rate debt 
the company uses an interest rate collar to eliminate interest rate fluctuations on million of variable rate debt included in other notes in the table above 
under the interest rate collar the company makes quarterly payments to or receives payments from another party when a variable rate falls below an established floor rate the company pays the counterparty or exceeds an established ceiling rate the company receives payment from the counterparty 
under the terms of the collar  which extends until  the variable rate is based on london interbank offered rate 
the floor rate of the collar is and the ceiling rate is 
the company would have had to pay million to terminate the interest rate collar at september  rate matters utility operation base rate adjustments in both the new york and pennsylvania jurisdictions do not reflect the recovery of purchased gas costs 
such costs are recovered through operation of the purchased gas adjustment clauses of the appropriate regulatory authorities 
new york jurisdiction on october   the nypsc approved a settlement agreement agreement between distribution corporation  staff of the department of public service  the new york state consumer protection board and multiple intervenors an advocate for large commercial and industrial customers collectively  parties that established rates for the three year period ending september  for a complete discussion of this agreement  refer to rate matters in item of the company s form k 
on july   the parties and other interests executed a settlement agreement settlement to extend the terms of the agreement and distribution corporation s restructuring plan one year commencing october  the settlement was approved by the nypsc in an order issued on september  as approved  the settlement continues existing base rates  and reduces the level above which earnings are shared with customers from the current return on equity to 
in addition  the settlement increases the combined pension and other post employment benefit expense by million  without a corresponding increase in revenues 
most other features of distribution corporation s service remain largely unchanged 
on september   the nypsc issued an order under which distribution corporation was directed to show cause why an action for penalties of million should not be commenced against it for alleged violations of consumer protection requirements 
according to the nypsc and intervenors  the alleged violations may have caused or contributed to the death of an individual in an unheated apartment 
on december   distribution corporation filed its response and requested that the nypsc either close dismiss the show cause proceeding based on the evidence presented in distribution corporation s response  or hold investigatory hearings to demonstrate that a penalty action is unwarranted 
on july   the nypsc issued an order granting distribution corporation s request for hearings  and referred the matter to an administrative law judge for scheduling and other matters 
the adoption of a procedural schedule has been adjourned because the major parties to the proceeding are involved in settlement discussions 
the company believes and will continue to vigorously assert that the nypsc s allegations lack merit 
for a discussion of related legal matters  refer to item  legal proceedings 
pennsylvania jurisdiction on april   distribution corporation filed a request with the pennsylvania public utility commission papuc to increase annual operating revenues by million to cover increases in the cost of providing service  to be effective june  the papuc suspended the effective date to january  distribution corporation filed this request for several reasons including increases in the costs associated with distribution corporation s ongoing construction program as well as increases in uncollectible accounts and personnel expenses 
on october   the parties reached a settlement of all issues 
the settlement was submitted to the administrative law judge  who thereafter  on november  issued a decision recommending adoption of the settlement 
the settlement provides for a base rate increase of million and authorizes deferral accounting for pension and opeb expenses 
the settlement was approved by the papuc on december   with rates scheduled to become effective january  pipeline and storage supply corporation currently does not have a rate case on file with the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
management will continue to monitor supply corporation s financial position to determine the necessity of filing a rate case in the future 
on november   the ferc issued order standards of conduct for transmission providers 
order regulates the conduct of transmission providers such as supply corporation with their energy affiliates 
the ferc broadened the definition of energy affiliates to include any affiliate of a transmission provider if that affiliate engages in or is involved in transmission gas or electric transactions  or manages or controls transmission capacity  or buys  sells  trades or administers natural gas or electric energy or engages in financial transactions relating to the sale or transmission of natural gas or electricity 
order provides that companies may request waivers  and also provides an exemption from this rule for local distribution corporations that are affiliated with interstate pipelines  such as distribution corporation  but the exemption is limited to local distribution corporations that do not make any off system sales 
distribution corporation currently does make such off system sales and would like to continue doing so  whether by waiver  amendment or clarification of the new rule 
order also appears to define empire state pipeline as an energy affiliate of supply corporation  which is looking into both the possible costs of complying and the possibilities of a waiver  amendment or clarification that would allow supply corporation and empire to operate together as they do now 
until there is further clarification from the ferc on the scope of these exemptions  the company is unable to predict the impact order will have on the company 
empire currently does not have a rate case on file with the nypsc 
management will continue to monitor its financial position in the new york jurisdiction to determine the necessity of filing a rate case in the future
