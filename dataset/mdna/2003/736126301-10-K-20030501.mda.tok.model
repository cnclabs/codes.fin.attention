such statements are based on current expectations that involve inherent risks and uncertainties  including those discussed below and under the heading risks associated with our business and future operating results that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed 
readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak as of the date hereof 
we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date hereof or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
overview portal develops  markets and supports customer management and billing cm b solutions for communications and content service providers 
our convergent platform enables service providers to deliver voice  data  video and content services with multiple networks  payment models  pricing plans and value chains 
beginning with fiscal  substantially all of our revenues have come from the license of one product line  infranet  and from related services 
revenues consist of infranet licenses  professional services  support and maintenance fees 
license revenues are comprised of perpetual or multiyear license fees  which are primarily derived from contracts with communications and content service providers 
professional services consist of a broad range of implementation services  training  business consulting and operational support services 
these services are provided throughout the customer lifecycle 
we believe that future revenues will be generated primarily from the following sources license fees from new customers  for new products or new infranet modules to existing customers  and growth in the subscriber base of existing customers  which will lead to increased revenue from subscriber based licenses  consulting services for the deployment of licenses and follow on solutions related to our customers end to end billing needs  and annual maintenance fees for the support of existing deployments and rights to access when and if available upgrade enhancements to our platform 
we have established a series of relationships with systems integrators and hardware platform  software and service providers 
we have derived  and anticipate that we will continue to derive  a substantial portion of our revenues from customers that have significant relationships with our integration and platform partners 
as a result of continuing consolidation in the communications and content delivery industries and the reduction in capital available for emerging companies  we expect to derive an increasing portion of our total revenues from large communications and content service providers 
in this regard  we anticipate that a substantial majority of our revenues will be derived from a fewer number of customers than in prior years 
we also plan to structure more of our transactions to provide for payments over a period of one year or more and to increase the number of arrangements where license and service fees are combined 
one of the impacts of this change in license structuring could be that license revenue would be recognized ratably over the term of the license arrangement or as payments from customers become due  or services are completed rather than being recorded as revenue upon delivery 
the portion of our total revenues that is derived from international operations has increased in recent years 
as a result  we will face greater exposure to the risks associated with international operations 
with respect to our services revenues  most of our professional services fees have been paid pursuant 
table of contents to time and materials arrangements 
we believe that in the future a larger portion of our services revenues will be based on fixed price contracts 
this could result in the deferral of revenue until contract completion  in the event that we were unable to reliably budget and estimate our obligations under these contracts or determine the fair value of the services being performed 
for a description of factors that may affect our future results see risks associated with our business and future operating results 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on a regular basis  we evaluate and may revise our estimates  including those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts  non marketable investments  long lived assets and goodwill and accrued restructuring expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with current generally accepted accounting principles that have been prescribed for the software industry 
revenue recognition requirements are very complex and are affected by interpretations of the rules and an understanding of industry practices  both of which are subject to change 
our revenue recognition policy is significant because our revenue is a key component of our results of operations 
we follow very specific and detailed guidelines in measuring revenue  however  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue recognition policy 
revenue from license fees is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
pursuant to the requirements of statement of position sop software revenue recognition and sop modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  portal uses the residual method to recognize revenue when a license agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
vsoe for undelivered elements is based on normal pricing for those elements when sold separately and  for maintenance services  is additionally measured by the renewal rate 
the software is considered to have been delivered when we have provided the customer with the access codes that allow for immediate possession of the software 
our revenue recognition policy takes into consideration the creditworthiness of the customer in determining the probability of collection as a criterion for revenue recognition 
the determination of creditworthiness requires the exercise of judgment  which affects our revenue recognition 
if a customer is deemed to not be creditworthy  all revenue under arrangements with that customer is recognized upon receipt of cash 
the creditworthiness of customers is re assessed on a regular basis and revenue is deferred until cash receipt  if appropriate 
additionally  when we enter into contracts with industry standard payment terms  it is portal s policy to recognize such revenue when the customer is deemed to be creditworthy and collection of the receivable is probable 
revenue from arrangements with customers who are not the ultimate users  such as resellers  is not recognized until evidence of an arrangement with an end user has been received 
our policy should we enter into a transaction with a customer to purchase the customer s products contemporaneously with the customer s purchase of software from portal  is to recognize the amount of license fees paid to portal net of the fees paid for the customer s products 

table of contents services revenues are primarily comprised of revenue from product deployment  follow on enhancements and other consulting fees  maintenance agreements and training 
when licenses arrangements include services  the license fees are recognized upon delivery  provided that the criteria set forth in the above paragraph have been met  payment of the license fees is not dependent upon the performance of the services  and the services are not essential to the functionality of the software 
when software services are not considered essential  which has been the case in the majority of our license arrangements  the revenue related to the time and materials services is recognized as the services are performed 
portal recognizes consulting revenue as services are performed 
if a services agreement includes milestones portal does not recognize revenue until customer acceptance has occurred 
to date  management has been successful in estimating efforts required under its services contracts  including its fixed price contracts  and accordingly  has not incurred any losses on its fixed priced contracts 
in the event that cost estimates exceed revenues in the future  we will accrue for the estimated losses if and when the losses become evident 
for arrangements that do not meet the above criteria  both the license revenues and services revenues are recognized under the percentage of completion contract method in accordance with the provisions of sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
portal follows the percentage of completion method since reasonably dependable estimates of progress toward completion of a contract can be made 
we estimate the percentage of completion on contracts utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of the total estimated hours at project completion 
recognized revenues and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
revisions in profit estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
maintenance agreements provide technical support and include the right to unspecified upgrades on an if and when available basis 
maintenance revenue is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis as services revenue over the life of the related agreement  which is typically one year 
customer advances and billed amounts due from customers in excess of revenue recognized are generally recorded as deferred revenue 
portal periodically updates its revenue recognition policies to reflect changes in the marketplace  its business practices and experiences with its customers to ensure compliance with revenue recognition rules and good business practices 
during the quarter ended july  portal revised its policy to better reflect industry practices and the shift in portal s customer base from internet service providers to diversified telecommunications companies 
the new policy continues to ensure compliance with technical pronouncements associated with software revenue recognition 
previously  portal s policy presumed that arrangements with payment terms extending beyond days did not meet the criteria for fixed and determinable fees 
under portal s revised policy  arrangements with payment terms extending beyond days may meet the fixed and determinable fee criteria based upon portal s evaluation of the risk of concession  subject to review and approval by portal s chief financial officer 
this change increased revenue recognized during the year ended january  by approximately million 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is established through a charge to general and administrative expenses 
this allowance is for estimated losses resulting from our customers failure or inability to make required payments 
it is a significant estimate and is regularly evaluated by us for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as past experience  credit quality of the customer  age of the receivable balance  individually and in the aggregate  and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different allowance balances 
our customer base is highly concentrated in the communications and content service provider industries 
several of the leading companies in these industries have experienced financial difficulty 
if collection is not probable at the time the transaction is consummated  we do not recognize revenue until cash is collected 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
non marketable investments we review the net realizable value of the non marketable investments on a quarterly basis  including reviewing the latest financial information available of our investee companies for signs of financial deterioration and recent press releases relating to the companies 
we also consider the impact of new stockholder preferences  if any  upon our investment position 
if we consider the net realizable value of our investments to be less than historical cost  then we determine whether a decline in fair value below the cost basis is other than temporary 
if the decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary  we will reduce the cost basis of the individual security to fair value as a new cost basis and the amount of the write down shall be included in earnings and accounted for as a realized loss 
the new cost basis will not be changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value 
long lived assets and goodwill portal evaluates the carrying value of long lived assets and intangibles  including goodwill  whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
on a regular basis  the estimated future net cash flows associated with the asset are compared to the asset s carrying amount to determine if impairment has occurred 
if such assets are deemed impaired  an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets is recognized 
if quoted market prices for the assets are not available  the fair value is calculated using the present value of estimated expected future net cash flows 
the cash flow calculations are based on management s best estimates  using appropriate assumptions and projections at the time 
during the fiscal year ended january   we identified indicators of possible impairment of the intangible assets arising from our acquisitions 
these indicators included deterioration in the business climate and prospects and intentions for these subsidiaries  implying that the downturn may be for a long period of time 
as related to our acquisition of solution  the indicators of impairment included the other than temporary decline in market values of technology companies in general and portal specifically 
our stock price experienced a steady decline over the course of several quarters  with a slight rebound at the end of the first quarter of fiscal the slight rebound in stock prices appeared to indicate a temporary decline in market values  but the stock continued on a downward trend in the second quarter of fiscal had solution been an independent company  we concluded that its valuation would have declined in a similar manner to portal s based on the similarity of products  target markets and declining revenue 
additionally  in the second quarter of fiscal the forecasted revenue for solution products deteriorated significantly from the forecasts made at the time of the acquisition 
in connection with our restructuring plans see restructuring costs below and note in notes to consolidated financial statements  we planned to reduce our headcount overseas which included many solution employees and cancelled research and development activities related to the solution product  both of which were a result of an other than temporary deterioration in business climate and a drastic reduction in forecasted revenue opportunities 

table of contents we measured the impairment loss related to long lived assets based on the amount by which the carrying amount of such assets exceeded its fair value 
measurement of fair value was based on an analysis of the future discounted cash flows at the solution level 
the analysis indicated that our long lived assets for solution were impaired by an amount totaling million 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment write down of this amount during the second quarter of fiscal during fiscal  we further reduced goodwill by million due to the reversal of excess accrued direct acquisition costs 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we identified additional indicators of impairment of our remaining solution long lived assets 
as a result  we recorded charges of million and million to reflect the impairment of goodwill and purchased developed technology  respectively  related to our investment 
in the fourth quarter of  we issued  shares valued at million to the former solution shareholders under the terms of the original purchase agreement  resulting in an additional impairment charge during the quarter 
due to the lack of revenues generated from baygate products together with the october reduction of workforce associated with baygate s product  we cancelled the further planned development of baygate related products 
based on these key factors  we recorded a charge of million during fiscal  to reflect the impairment of purchased developed technology related to our investment in baygate 
we did not record any write downs of long lived assets during fiscal accrued restructuring expenses during the fiscal years ended january  and  we implemented restructuring plans that were a combination of reductions in workforce  consolidations of facilities and the write off of assets 
the restructuring charges were based on actual and estimated costs incurred in connection with these restructuring plans 
these estimates have been impacted by the rules governing the termination of employees  especially those in foreign countries 
we have not recorded payments related to potential settlements on disputed severance agreements  as these amounts are not reasonably estimable and probable 
if  in the future  we were to agree upon additional severance payments  we would have to record additional restructuring charges in the period in which the settlement was determined to be reasonably estimable and probable 
we have accrued restructuring charges for lease commitments  net of sublease income  utilizing planned exit dates for vacating the various facilities included as part of the restructuring 
for the portion of the facilities that we continued to occupy subsequent to the plan s approval  we have included rental costs relating to the period following the planned exit date in the restructuring charges 
we have reduced the amount of the facilities restructuring charge by the estimated amount of sublease income 
the assumptions we have made are based on the current market conditions in the various areas we have vacant space and necessarily entail a high level of management judgment 
these market conditions can fluctuate greatly due to such factors as changes in property occupancy rates  the rental prices charged for comparable properties and the general economic condition of the areas in which our facilities are located 
these changes could materially affect our accrual 
if  in future periods  it is determined that we have over accrued restructuring charges for the consolidation of facilities  the reversal of such over accrual would have a favorable impact on our financial statements in the period this was determined and would be recorded as a credit to restructuring costs 
conversely  if it is determined that our accrual is insufficient  an additional charge would have an unfavorable impact on our financial statements in the period this was determined 
additionally  we recorded certain asset write offs relating to our restructuring efforts including leasehold improvements as a result of the abandonment of various operating lease facilities  portal wrote off the net book values of the related leasehold improvements 
portal continued to record depreciation expense  included in operating expenses  for the leasehold improvements until it no longer occupied the facilities or portions of the facilities 
upon vacating these facilities  portal wrote off the net book value of these leasehold improvements 

table of contents furniture and fixtures as a result of abandoning facilities  portal decided to also abandon furniture and fixtures in the vacated facilities or portion of the facilities 
upon vacating the facilities and abandoning the furniture and fixtures  portal wrote off the net book value of the abandoned assets 
software as a result of the reductions in force  portal assessed its need for the number of licenses for software currently in use 
based on current and projected future needs  portal determined that the number of licenses purchased exceeds the actual number needed 
accordingly  portal abandoned the unused licenses and wrote off the related portion of the license fees associated with these purchased software packages 
laptop computers used by exiting employees portal wrote off the book value of its laptop computers used by exiting employees that either it did not expect to be returned by the severed employees or it expected to scrap or sell 
portal made a decision to sell the computers returned by exiting employees  as it believed that by the time it begins to experience growth  the computers would be obsolete 
portal recorded the charge for the computer write offs net of expected proceeds received from the sale of computers 
as this cost is related to employees who were terminated as part of the restructuring plans  we included the charge as part of the restructuring expense

cost of services cost of services primarily consists of consulting  maintenance  and training expenses 
cost of services decreased in fiscal from fiscal primarily due to a reduction in our services workforce resulting from the geographic realignment of consulting and support resources 
cost of services increased slightly in fiscal from fiscal primarily due to an increase in the number of consulting and technical support personnel  in the beginning of the fiscal year  to support the actual and previously anticipated expansion of our installed base of customers and new implementations 
this increase was partially offset by a reduction in our services workforce as a result of a reduced number of professional consulting projects

the increase in the gross margin for fiscal from fiscal was primarily the result of the efficiencies achieved through reductions in our consulting workforce 
the decrease in gross margin for services  during fiscal from fiscal  was due to reduced utilization of professional services personnel as a result of the decrease in new implementation projects 
amortization and impairment of purchased developed technology in fiscal year  we purchased third party software for which certain functionality was integrated into our product 
in fiscal  the depreciation of the license and the amortization of the support agreement have been reclassified from research and development expenses to amortization and impairment of purchased developed technology  a direct cost of product license revenues 
comparative results have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal presentation 
due to our restructuring plan in july  we re assessed our need for this software and we decided against further integration due to the reductions in workforce 
as a result we incurred a one time charge of million  in the quarter ended october   that has been included in this category in the consolidated statements of operations 
in fiscal  we recorded an asset of million for purchased developed technology as a result of acquiring solution and baygate 
purchased developed technology was being amortized  on a straight line basis  over the estimated useful life of the respective assets of three to four years 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements

these increases were partially offset by a decrease in facility lease expenses due to the implementation of our restructuring plans in fiscal our policy has been to maintain accounts receivable reserves based on specifically identified credit concerns and on our historical experience of delinquencies 
during  we determined that a protracted business deterioration in a class of our customers was impacting their ability to make payments when due

in fiscal  as a result of better than anticipated collections and more stringent credit policies  no additions to bad debt expense were required and accounts receivable reserves were decreased 
stock compensation charges in fiscal  our board of directors approved a plan to reprice stock options for continuing employees excluding the chief executive officer and members of the board of directors 
under this repricing plan  approximately  outstanding options with an exercise price greater than per share the closing market price on the date of repricing were repriced to an exercise price of per share

interest and other income  net decreased approximately million or in fiscal from fiscal and decreased approximately million or  in fiscal from fiscal the decrease in both years was due to declining interest rates on lower cash balances 
write down of impaired investments on july   we held non marketable securities of three private companies  each with a cost basis of million 
during fiscal  two of the three companies demonstrated cash burn rates significantly in excess of their respective working capital levels and their anticipated access to funding 
further  both companies were in loss positions and  despite efforts to reduce their respective spending levels  continued to record losses due to slow growing revenues 
considering the downturn in the economy  we believed that it would be difficult for the companies to obtain additional financing 
consequently  we believed that these were sufficient indicators that these non marketable investments experienced other than temporary declines in value as of july  as portal did not foresee these investments generating any value or cash in the foreseeable future  and as such did not foresee the investments returning to the valuation levels at the time of portal s initial investment  we deemed the decline in value to be other than temporary and consequently wrote off the million of cost 
the remaining million total investment of million net of a million write down was determined to not be impaired as of january  based upon a review of the company s financial statements and their business plan 
even though the company is still generating losses  it has experienced growth in revenues and has continued to make concerted efforts to reduce its cost structure 
we will continue to monitor our investment in this company for signs of potential impairment 
provision for income taxes the income tax provision was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the income tax provision for each of these fiscal years primarily relates to foreign withholding taxes on revenue and tax on earnings generated from operations in certain foreign jurisdictions 
although we recorded net losses of million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively  our foreign operations were profitable for tax purposes primarily due to the intercompany charge back arrangements necessary under the local tax laws 
based on a number of factors  we believe there is sufficient uncertainty regarding deferred tax assets 
these factors include consideration of past operating results  the competitive nature of our market and the unpredictability of future operating results 
therefore  we have fully reserved our deferred tax assets as of january  we will continue to assess our ability to realize tax benefits available to us based on actual and forecasted operating results 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and investments including restricted investments of million totaled million at january   compared to a balance of million at january  we used cash totaling million in operations during the year ended january   a decrease of million from the million used in the year ended january  net cash used in operations in fiscal was primarily comprised of net losses adjusted for non cash expenses  a decrease in deferred revenue of million  a decrease in other accrued liabilities of million and a decrease in accrued employee benefits of 
table of contents million 
the decrease in deferred revenue was due to a lack of new revenues to fully offset recognition of past deferrals 
the decrease in accrued liabilities was due to a reduction in spending in response to the worsening economic conditions 
accrued employee benefits decreased primarily due to the reductions in our workforce that were part of our restructuring plans see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
adjustments made for non cash expenses  such as depreciation  amortization  stock compensation charges  amortization of purchased intangibles and goodwill  reduction in intangibles due to impairment  and restructuring costs  write down of impaired investments and write off of goodwill amounted to million for fiscal as of january  the total remaining cash outlay for all restructuring plans is estimated to be million which includes severance related costs as well as lease liabilities related to the consolidation of facilities and is expected to be funded by available cash 
of the million  lease payments for impacted facilities  net of expected sublease income  are expected to be million and will be paid out through net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended january   a decrease of million from the million used in the year ended january  net cash provided by investing activities in the year ended january  was primarily comprised of the maturities and sales of short term investments  net of purchases 
during the year ended january   we purchased computer equipment and software  made leasehold improvements and purchased other capital equipment amounting to approximately million  primarily to support our ongoing operations and information systems 
historically  we have also used debt and leases to partially finance our operations and capital purchases 
no capital leases were entered into during fiscal net cash from financing activities was million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
this resulted from net proceeds from sales of common stock issued from our employee stock purchase plan and upon the exercise of stock options by employees of million in and million in  partially offset by repayment of capital lease obligations and notes payable of million in and million in in the normal course of business  we enter into leases for facilities in both domestic and international locations 
these leases are for terms expiring from april through march in connection with our facility leases  we issued letters of credit in lieu of a security deposit for the facilities see note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
due to the restructuring activities that occurred during fiscal and  several facilities were vacated or are underutilized 
some of these facilities have been subleased 
we are also attempting to sublease additional surplus facilities comprising approximately  square feet

table of contents the following table summarizes our other commitments as of january  and the effect such commitments could have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods if the letters of credit or the guarantees were drawn upon 
restricted investments represent the collateral for these commitments 
in thousands 
total less than year years years over years letters of credit guarantees our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including the timing of customer orders and engagements  and related obligations and payments  market acceptance of our products  the resources we devote to developing  marketing  selling and supporting our products  the timing and extent of changes in the size of our operations and other factors 
our planned expense levels for each of the fiscal quarters of fiscal exceed the revenues we generated in the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result  we will need to generate increased revenues from licenses of our products and sale of our services to achieve and maintain operating profitability 
although we believe that our current cash balances and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months  we may require additional financing within this time frame 
we may seek financing at any time that we determine market conditions are favorable 
additional funding  if needed  may cause dilution to our stockholders or the incurrence of debt and such funding may not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all

our revenues will be adversely affected as a result of economic conditions affecting our target markets we primarily market our products and services to providers of communications and content services 
during the past few years  the telecommunications industry has experienced a difficult economic environment 
the substantial number of business failures and the decline in the market value of dot com and other technology companies in the past few years has made it more difficult for emerging communication and electronic content companies to obtain financing for their operations 
moreover  the market value  financial results and prospects of many large and established companies  including many large telecommunications companies  have also declined or degraded significantly 
many communications and content companies have significantly reduced their expenditures and have reduced or deferred their purchases of software and related products and the introduction of many new communication services has been delayed or cancelled 
cancellations of existing or planned services also adversely impact potential professional service  maintenance and support revenues 
any general decrease by our customers and potential customers in their rate of software and network investments results in a significant decrease in our revenues and operating income 
these trends in technology and software spending dramatically adversely impacted our business in fiscal and and will continue to adversely affect our business until conditions improve 
failure to collect accounts receivable in a timely manner has in the past and may in the future result in significant write offs  higher accounts receivable reserves and lower cash balances that would adversely affect our financial results and available cash resources 
we expect to incur additional losses and cannot be certain that we will be profitable or generate positive cash flow in order to be profitable or generate positive cash flow  we must significantly increase our revenues or further reduce our expenses 
we may not be able to increase or even maintain our revenues and we may not achieve sufficient revenues to attain profitability in any future period 
moreover  we have already significantly reduced our expenses through a series of restructurings and there may be a limit to our ability to further reduce expenses without significantly damaging our operational capabilities 
we incurred net losses of approximately million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 

table of contents if we do not generate increased revenues from sales of our products or reduce expenses  we will not be profitable or generate positive cash flow 
the decrease in capital expenditures by communications companies as well as the general economic slowdown has adversely affected our revenues and will make it difficult to increase revenues until spending in our target markets increases 
we also expect that we will face increased competition that may make it more difficult to increase our revenues 
even if we are able to increase revenues  we have experienced and may continue to experience price competition that would lower our gross margins and reduce our ability to become profitable 
furthermore  we may offer  in the future  some of our products and services for a bundled price  such that a separate price would not be identified for the product and service components 
such a change may significantly delay the timing of our revenue recognition 
another factor that would lower our gross margins is any increase in the percentage of our revenues that is derived from indirect channels and from services  both of which have lower margins than our license revenues 
failure to achieve the desired reductions in our expenses will further increase our losses 
we cannot be certain that we will achieve operating or net profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
additionally  failure to achieve a positive cash flow will continue to result in reductions in our existing cash resources 
our quarterly revenue is generated from a limited number of customers and our customer base is concentrated  the loss of one or more of our customers could cause our business to suffer a substantial portion of our license and services revenues in any given quarter has been  and is expected to continue to be  generated from a limited number of customers with large financial commitments 
for example  america online accounted for more than of our total revenues during each of the quarters of fiscal as a result  if a large contract is cancelled or deferred or an anticipated contract does not materialize  our business would be harmed 
our total revenues could also be adversely affected if revenues from a significant customer in one period are not replaced with revenues from that customer or other customers in subsequent periods 
the communication and content industries we have targeted are consolidating  which could reduce the number of potential customers available to us 
moreover  many of our customers may have purchased sufficient quantities of our products to satisfy their current or anticipated requirements 
for all of these reasons our business could suffer in the future 
it is difficult to predict the timing of individual orders because infranet has a long and variable sales cycles and implementation periods the sales cycle for infranet varies greatly  generally ranging between to months 
sales cycles have recently lengthened as the competitive environment has become more intense  the financial position of our potential customers has weakened and price discounting has further delayed customer decision processes  as there is less business available from telecommunications companies 
along with systems integrators and our other distribution partners  we spend significant time educating and providing information to our prospective customers regarding the use and benefits of infranet 
customers increasingly require vendors to perform proof of concept projects and performance benchmarks as a part of the sales cycles 
these tests can further lengthen sales cycles and increase our sales costs 
the long sales and implementation cycles for infranet make it more difficult to predict our future financial results and may cause license revenues and operating results to vary significantly from period to period 
even after purchase  our customers tend to deploy infranet slowly and deliberately  depending on the specific technical capabilities of the customer  the size of the deployment  the complexity of the customer s network environment and the quantity of hardware and the degree of hardware configuration necessary to deploy infranet 
the length of time to implement and deploy systems involving infranet may have an impact on the timing and amount of revenues ultimately received from customers  particularly if payments are tied to implementation or production milestones 
as a result  the revenues derived from a sale may not be recognized immediately and could be spread over an extended period 
as a result  an increase in the period of time over which revenue is recognized may cause a decline in the amount of revenues in the short term 

table of contents the markets in which we sell our product are highly competitive and we may not be able to compete effectively we compete in markets that are intensely competitive and rapidly changing 
we face competition from providers of customer management and billing software  such as amdocs ltd  convergys corporation  csg systems international  inc and we also compete with systems integrators and with internal information technology departments of larger communications providers 
most of our current principal competitors have significantly more personnel and greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we have 
many of our competitors also have more diversified businesses  established reputations in particular market segments  larger customer bases and are not as dependent on customers in our target market 
our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements than we can 
intense competition has recently been exemplified by deep price discounting by our competitors that has resulted in a lengthening of our sales cycles  price reductions and may threaten our ability to close forecasted business 
additionally  our financial strength or that of a competitor is one factor considered by many potential customers in their vendor selections 
because many of our competitors have greater financial resources than we do  this can adversely affect our ability to be selected by potential customers 
increased competition can result in price reductions  fewer customer orders  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any of which could harm our business 
our failure to develop and market products and services that compete successfully with those of other suppliers in the market would harm our business 
we anticipate that the market for our products and services will remain intensely competitive 
our inability to sublease or reduce surplus office space would increase our use of cash and operating expenses and adversely effect operating results and our financial condition we must periodically acquire and dispose of our office facilities in various locations as the number of existing and projected employees changes for those locations or as existing leases expire 
securing and building out facilities takes significant lead time 
historically  because of the need to satisfy projected future expansion  the amount of space we have leased is generally more than the amount currently required 
our significant office leases have terms of between and years 
as a result  we frequently attempt to sublease the portions of leased facilities that we have leased to meet our future expansion plans but do not currently need 
in addition  our reductions in our workforce undertaken over the past year have substantially reduced our facilities requirements in several locations 
as a result  we are attempting to sublease the facilities that we have previously leased but do not currently need or to negotiate reductions in our rent obligations relating to those facilities or cancellations of the applicable leases 
we have leased approximately  square feet and  square feet for our regional headquarters facilities in cupertino  california and our regional headquarters facilities in slough  united kingdom  respectively  through and  respectively 
the amounts leased exceed our current requirements and we plan to sublease a majority of the facilities for a substantial portion  if not the entire balance  of the lease term 
there is currently a large amount of vacant commercial real estate in the san francisco bay area and in other locations where we have facilities 
moreover  currently prevailing rental rates in many locations are significantly lower than those that we are obligated to pay under the leases 
we may therefore continue to encounter significant difficulties or delays in subleasing our surplus space and may not be able to sublease it for rents equal to those that we are obligated to pay 
in connection with our restructuring plan adopted in fiscal  we have vacated additional facilities in the united states and in other locations 
to the extent that we are unable to renegotiate the terms or cancel the applicable leases or to sublease this and other surplus space at an amount equal to our rent obligations for that space or to the extent sublessees fail to perform their obligations to pay rent  we could incur greater operating expenses than we initially anticipated or included within accrued restructuring charges 
such increases in operating expenses in a period could cause us to exceed our planned expense levels and adversely affect our financial results for that period 
cancellation of 
table of contents leases will likely result in use of significant amounts of cash and additional restructuring charges 
furthermore  inability to sublease such space may adversely affect our planned uses of cash and our capital resources 
moreover  we have reduced the amount of the facilities restructuring charges we accrued in fiscal and by the estimated amount of sublease income 
the assumptions we have made were based on the then current market conditions in the various areas we have vacant space 
these market conditions can fluctuate greatly  thus causing our accrual to be inaccurate 
if  in future periods  it is determined that we have over accrued for restructuring charges as related to the consolidation of facilities  the reversal of such over accrual would have a favorable impact on our financial statements in the period this was determined 
conversely  if it is determined that our accrual is insufficient  an additional charge would have a significant unfavorable impact on our financial statements in the period this was determined 
our operating plans rely on our ability to successfully increase the size and scope of our operations in india and a failure to manage that process and organization could affect our operations in fiscal we opened an engineering center in bangalore  india 
in fiscal we plan to significantly increase the size of this organization and expand its scope 
the expansion of this organization is an important component of our strategy to address the business needs of our customers  increase our revenues and achieve profitability 
a portion of the personnel in this organization is our employees and the balance are provided through an independent contractor 
the success of this operation will depend on our ability to attract  train  assimilate or retain sufficient highly qualified personnel in the required periods 
a disruption of our relationship with the independent contractor would adversely impact the effectiveness of the india organization and could adversely affect our operations and financial results 
failure to effectively manage and integrate these operations will harm our business and financial results 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate in future periods and we may fail to meet expectations our revenues and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors 
in future quarters  our operating results may be below the expectations of one or more public market analysts and investors and the price of our common stock may fall 
failure by technology companies to meet or exceed analyst expectations or any resulting changes in analyst recommendations or ratings frequently results in substantial decreases in the market value of the stock of such companies 
factors that could cause quarterly fluctuations include variations in demand for our products and services  including decreases caused by reductions in technology spending within our target markets  the timing and execution of individual contracts  particularly large contracts that would materially affect our operating results in a given quarter  large contracts with extensive consulting services may require the use of contract accounting for revenue recognition purposes thereby extending the period of time over which revenue is recognized  our ability to develop and attain market acceptance of enhancements to infranet and new products and services  market acceptance of new communications services that our products are intended to support  delays in introducing new products and services  new product introductions by our competitors  changes in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors  announcements of new versions of our products that cause customers to postpone purchases of our current products  the mix of products and services sold  
table of contents the mix of sales channels through which our products and services are sold  the mix of domestic and international sales  costs related to acquisitions of technologies or businesses  the timing of releases of new versions of third party software and hardware products that work with our products  our ability to attract  integrate  train  retain and motivate a substantial number of sales and marketing  research and development  technical support and other management personnel with the needed competencies  the variability of future stock based compensation charges or credits as a result of our stock option repricing during fiscal year  our ability to sublease our excess real estate or renegotiate our leases  and global economic conditions generally  as well as those specific to providers of communications and content services 
we have difficulty predicting the volume and timing of orders for new license transactions 
in any given quarter  our sales have involved  and we expect will continue to involve  large financial commitments from a relatively small number of customers 
as a result  the cancellation or deferral of even a small number of licenses of infranet would reduce our revenues  which would adversely affect our quarterly financial performance 
also  we have often booked a large amount of our sales in the last month of the quarter and often in the last week of that month 
accordingly  delays in the closing of sales near the end of a quarter could cause quarterly revenue to fall substantially short of anticipated levels 
furthermore  delays in the closing of license transactions may result in a consequential delay or loss of services revenues relating to the projects for which the software would be licensed 
while a portion of our revenues each quarter is recognized from deferred revenue relating to previously signed contracts  our quarterly performance will depend primarily upon entering into new contracts to generate revenues for that quarter 
we may not be successful in entering into contracts with new or existing customers 
new contracts that we enter into may not result in revenue in the quarter in which the contract is signed and we may not be able to predict accurately when revenues from these contracts will be recognized 
we determine our operating expenses largely on the basis of anticipated revenue trends and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short and medium term 
as a result  a failure or delay in generating or recognizing revenue could cause significant variations in our operating results from quarter to quarter and could result in substantial operating losses 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate in future periods due to seasonal variations and we may fail to meet expectations we may also experience seasonality in our business 
in many software companies  the rate of growth or absolute amount of license fee revenues tends to decline from the fourth quarter of one year to the first quarter of the next year  due in part to the structure of sales compensation plans 
our revenue in the first quarter of fiscal and was significantly lower than the preceding fourth quarter 
if we experience such seasonality in the future our rate of growth or absolute revenues could decline in the first quarter of a fiscal year compared to the preceding fourth quarter 
such seasonality may cause our results of operations to fluctuate or become more difficult to predict and could cause us to fail to meet internal or analyst expected financial results 
our business depends on the commercial acceptance of our products and it is uncertain to what extent the market will accept them our future growth depends on the commercial success of our infranet family of products 
our license fees revenues are derived from our infranet product family 
our business will be harmed if our target customers do 
table of contents not adopt and purchase infranet 
prospective customers may base their purchasing decisions on a vendor s ability to support their customer management and billing needs for both their new services and their other existing service offerings  such as fixed wire or mobile voice telephony or cable television 
our ability to address these current and future service requirements with our current version of infranet and planned future enhancements may affect the market acceptance of infranet by prospective customers who desire an integrated customer management and billing solution for their different services 
our future financial performance will also depend on the successful development  introduction and customer acceptance of new and enhanced versions of our products 
we are not certain that our target customers will widely adopt and deploy infranet as their customer management and billing solution 
in the future we may not be successful in marketing infranet or any new or enhanced products or services 
our future revenues will also depend on our customers licensing software for additional applications or for additional subscribers 
their failure to do so could harm our business 
our customers deploy infranet across a variety of computer hardware platforms and integrate it with a number of legacy systems  third party software applications and programming tools 
customers frequently use our professional services  third party system integrators or their own internal information technology organizations  or a combination thereof 
our ability to generate and increase our professional services revenues will depend in large part on the number of new license transactions and on our ability to gain a significant portion of the services associated with the implementation of infranet related projects 
we are not certain that our target customers will widely adopt and use our professional services 
in the future we may not be successful in marketing our services our failure to do so could harm our business 
the revenues we derive from our services business have a significantly lower margin than revenues derived from licensing infranet 
accordingly  the mix of license revenues and service revenues in any period will affect our operating margins for that period 
failure to meet analyst expectations for operating margins and profitability could cause a decrease in the market value of our common stock 
our significant international operations make us much more susceptible to risks from international operations for fiscal and  we derived approximately and of our revenue  respectively  from sales outside north america 
in addition  in fiscal we opened an engineering center in bangalore  india 
as a result  we face risks from doing business on an international basis  including  among others reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  licenses  tariffs and other trade barriers  fluctuations in the value of local currencies relative to the united states dollar and greater difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer sales and payment cycles  political and economic instability  seasonal reductions in business activity  terrorism  war or the potential for hostilities  potentially adverse tax consequences  compliance with a wide variety of complex foreign laws and treaties other circumstances  such as epidemics or natural disasters affecting the applicable area or that have a dampening effect on international business or travel  and variance and unexpected changes in local laws and regulations 

table of contents we currently have offices in a number of foreign locations including australia  canada  china  france  germany  italy  india  japan  malaysia  mexico  poland  singapore  spain  south korea  sweden  taiwan and the united kingdom and may establish additional facilities in other parts of the world 
expansion of our existing international operations and entry into additional international markets will require significant management attention and financial resources 
we cannot be certain that our investments in establishing facilities in other countries will produce desired levels of revenue 
historically  we have typically denominated most of our international license revenues in us dollars 
because our foreign currency denominated revenues have been minimal  we have not engaged in currency hedging activities 
commencing in fiscal  we denominated a larger number of international transactions in euros and certain other currencies see also impact of foreign currency rate changes in item below 
as a result  we will face greater exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in order to reduce the effect of foreign currency fluctuations  we may hedge our exposure on certain transactional balances that are denominated in foreign currencies through the use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
failure to effectively hedge foreign currency fluctuations would adversely affect our financial results 
to the extent that we are unable to successfully manage our international business due to any of the foregoing factors  our business could be adversely affected 
our business will suffer dramatically if we fail to successfully plan and manage changes in the size of our operations our ability to successfully offer our products and services in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning and management process 
we have experienced rapid changes in our number of employees in recent years 
on february   we had employees compared to on march  and  employees on january  in  we plan to significantly increase the number of employees and contractors in our india operations 
these changes and reorganizations and realignment of personnel have placed  and our anticipated future operations will continue to place  a significant strain on our management resources and our ability to train and allocate sufficient personnel resources to achieve our many objectives 
we expect that we will need to continue to evolve our financial and managerial controls and reporting systems and procedures and will need to continue to recruit  train and manage our worldwide work force 
we expect that we will have to change our facilities in certain locations and we may face difficulties and significant expenses identifying and moving into suitable office space and subleasing or assigning any surplus space 
in addition  reduction in the number of employees can result in significant severance  administrative and legal expenses 
reductions in the number of personnel or reorganization of responsibilities from personnel in one organization or region to another may also adversely affect  or delay  various sales  marketing and product development programs and activities 
this may increase the potential likelihood of other risks  such as delays in product introductions and reduce the effectiveness of general administrative services 
our business will suffer dramatically if we fail to effectively manage changes in the size and scope of our operations 
our future success depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel despite overall reductions in our total headcount  we will continue to hire sales  support  marketing  administrative and research and development personnel in the future 
competition for these individuals is intense and we may not be able to attract  assimilate or retain highly qualified personnel in the future 
in particular  our financial success and our ability to increase revenues in the future depend considerably upon the productivity of our direct sales force that has historically generated a majority of our license revenues 
this productivity will depend to a large degree on our success in recruiting  training and retaining qualified direct salespeople 
our business will be harmed if we fail to hire or retain qualified personnel  or if newly hired employees  particularly 
table of contents salespeople  fail to develop the necessary sales skills or develop these skills more slowly than we anticipate 
our future success also depends upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key sales  marketing and support personnel in general 
we also use systems integrators and other strategic relationships to implement and sell infranet we have entered into relationships with third party systems integrators  as well as with hardware platform and software applications developers and service providers 
we have derived  and anticipate that we will continue to derive  some portion of our market opportunities and revenues from these relationships 
many of these partners also work with competing software companies and our success will depend on their willingness and ability to devote sufficient resources and efforts to marketing and resale of our products versus the products of others 
we may not be able to enter into additional  or maintain our existing  strategic relationships on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
our agreements with these parties typically are in the form of nonexclusive referral fee or reseller agreements that are effective for a limited period of time and may be renewed only by mutual agreement of both parties 
therefore  there is no guarantee that any single party will continue to market our products 
we could lose sales opportunities if we fail to work effectively with these parties or fail to grow our base of market and platform partners 
we may also be at a serious competitive disadvantage if we fail to maintain and enhance these indirect sales channels 
our business will suffer if our software contains significant errors or our product development is delayed we face possible claims and higher costs as a result of the complexity of our products and the potential for undetected errors 
due to the mission critical nature of infranet  undetected errors are of particular concern 
complex software  such as ours  always contains undetected errors 
the implementation of infranet  which we accomplish through our services division and with our partners  typically involves working with sophisticated software  computing and communications systems 
if we experience difficulties with an implementation or do not meet project milestones in a timely manner  we could be obligated to devote more customer support  engineering and other resources to a particular project and to provide these services at reduced or no cost 
moreover  some contracts subject us to penalties if we are unable to correct errors within the required time 
if our software contains significant undetected errors or we fail to meet our customers expectations or project milestones in a timely manner we could experience monetary penalties or contract damages  loss of or delay in revenues and loss of market share  loss of customers  failure to achieve market acceptance  diversion of development and implementation resources  injury to our reputation  increased service and warranty costs  legal actions by customers against us  and increased insurance costs 
our licenses with customers generally contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims  such as disclaimers of warranties and limitations on liability for special  consequential and incidental damages 
in addition  our license agreements generally cap the amounts recoverable for damages to the amounts paid by the licensee to us for the product or service giving rise to the damages or to a multiple of such amounts 
however  these contractual limitations on liability may not be enforceable  in certain jurisdictions and under certain circumstances  and we may be subject to claims based on errors in our software or mistakes in 
table of contents performing our services including claims relating to damages to our customers internal systems 
a product liability claim  whether or not successful  could harm our business by increasing our costs  damaging our reputation and distracting our management 
our future success will depend on our ability to manage technological change the market for our products and the services they are used to support is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions  changes in customer requirements  and evolving industry standards 
future versions of hardware and software platforms embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render our products obsolete 
our future success will depend upon our ability to develop and introduce a variety of new products and product enhancements to address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers 
infranet is designed to work on a variety of hardware and software platforms used by our customers 
however  infranet may not operate correctly on evolving versions of hardware and software platforms  programming languages  database environments  accounting and other systems that our customers use 
we must constantly modify and improve our products to keep pace with changes made to these platforms and to back office applications and other systems 
this may result in uncertainty relating to the timing and nature of new product announcements  introductions or modifications  which may harm our business 
if we fail to modify or improve our products in response to evolving industry standards  our products could rapidly become obsolete  which would harm our business 
if we fail to release products on time  our business will suffer in the past we have failed to release certain new products and upgrades on time 
these delays may result in customer dissatisfaction  cancellation of orders and license agreements  negative publicity  loss of revenues  slower market acceptance  or legal action by customers against us 
our business may be harmed if we are unable to develop  license or acquire new products or enhancements to infranet future regulation of the internet or next generation communication services may slow their growth  resulting in decreased demand for our products and services and increased costs of doing business it is possible that state and federal regulators could adopt laws and regulations that may impose additional burdens on those companies providing communications and content services 
the growth and development of new services may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws or for imposition of additional taxes 
the adoption of any additional laws or regulations affecting communication services may slow their adoption or

a decline in the growth of next generation communication services could decrease demand for our products and services and increase our cost of doing business  or otherwise harm our business 
our proprietary rights may be inadequately protected and there is a risk of infringement our success and ability to compete depend substantially upon our internally developed technology  which we protect through a combination of patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark law 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology or to develop products with the same functionality as our products 
in addition  current or former employees may seek employment with our business partners  customers or competitors 
although our employees are required to sign confidentiality agreements at the time of hire  we cannot assure you that the confidential nature of certain proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment 
policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology 
moreover  as the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps  we expect that our software products may in the future become subject to third party infringement claims 
some of our competitors in the market for customer management and billing software may have filed or may intend to file patent applications covering aspects of their technology upon which they may claim our technology infringes 
any litigation  brought by us or by others  could be time consuming and costly and could divert the attention of our technical and management personnel 
in addition  litigation could cause product shipment delays or require us to develop non infringing technology or enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
such royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all  and could have a material and adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability 
if a successful claim of product infringement were made against us  our business could be significantly harmed 
we incorporate software licensed from third parties into infranet and any significant interruption in the availability of these third party software products or defects in these products could harm our business in the short term portions of infranet incorporate software developed and maintained by third party software vendors 
we may incorporate additional software from third party vendors and developers in our future products 
any significant interruption in the availability of these third party software products or defects in these products or future products could harm our sales unless and until we can secure another source 
we may not be able to replace the functionality provided by the third party software currently offered with our products if that software becomes obsolete  defective or incompatible with future versions of our products or is not adequately maintained or updated 
the absence of  or any significant delay in  the replacement of that functionality could result in delayed or lost sales and increased costs and could harm our business in the short term 
we are currently a party to securities litigation class action lawsuits which  if determined adversely  could negatively affect our business and results of operations on july   a purported class action complaint was filed in the federal district court southern district of new york against portal  certain of its officers and several underwriters of portal s initial public offering ipo 
the lawsuit alleges violations of section of the securities act of  as amended and section b of the securities exchange act of  as amended  arising from alleged improprieties by the underwriters in connection with our ipo and follow on public offering  and claims to be on behalf of all persons who purchased portal software shares from may  through december  four additional nearly identical class actions were also filed in july and august based on essentially the same facts and allegations 
specifically  the complaints allege the underwriters charged certain of their customers fees in excess of those 
table of contents disclosed in the prospectus and engaged in certain allegedly improper activities in connection with the distribution of the ipo shares 
the complaint was subsequently amended to allege similar claims with respect our secondary public offering in september the cases have been consolidated into a single action  and a consolidated complaint was filed on april  these actions are part of the ipo securities litigation against over issuers and nearly underwriters alleging claims virtually identical to those alleged against us 
the action seeks damages in an unspecified amount 
a motion to dismiss addressing issues common to the companies and individuals who have been sued in these actions has been dismissed and discovery is expected to begin in the near future 
an unfavorable resolution of these matters could materially affect our future results of operations or cash flows in a particular period 
in addition  the litigation has been  and may continue to be  time consuming and costly and could divert the attention of our management personnel 
the price of our common stock has been and will continue to be volatile the trading price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and will continue to fluctuate in the future 
for example  the price of our common stock through january  has fluctuated between and per share 
future fluctuation could be a result of a number of factors  many of which are outside our control 
some of these factors include quarter to quarter variations in our operating results  failure to meet the expectations of industry analysts  changes in earnings estimates by us or by analysts  general conditions in the communications and content service industries  announcements and technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  increased price competition  and developments or disputes concerning intellectual property rights 
in addition  the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  which have particularly affected the market prices of many internet and computer software companies  including ours  and which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies or our company 
decreases in the trading prices of stocks of technology companies are often precipitous 
for example  the price of our stock dropped rapidly and significantly during the first quarter of fiscal  during the fourth quarter of fiscal and during the first quarter of fiscal if the market for our products does not improve  we may be forced to incur restructuring charges in addition to the million charge  the million charge and the million charge we incurred in the fiscal year ended january   the quarter ended july  and the quarter ended october   respectively during the fiscal year ended january  and the quarters ended july  and october  we incurred charges of million  million and million  respectively  in connection with restructuring plans implemented to reduce our cost structure 
these restructuring plans were implemented in response to the continued global deferral of capital expenditures by telecommunications companies  as well as the general downturn in the economy 
if the poor market environment for telecommunications and content service providers continues and capital expenditures continue to be deferred or our business otherwise continues to suffer  we may implement additional restructuring plans to further reduce our cost structure and incur additional restructuring charges 
any additional restructuring charges could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 

table of contents anti takeover provisions in our charter documents  stockholder rights plan and in delaware law could prevent or delay a change in control and  as a result  negatively impact our stockholders we have taken a number of actions that could have the effect of discouraging a takeover attempt 
for example  we have adopted a stockholder rights plan that would cause substantial dilution to a stockholder  and substantially increase the cost paid by a potential acquirer  who attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our board of directors 
this could prevent us from being acquired or reduce the price paid by any potential acquirer 
in addition  our certificate of incorporation grants the board of directors the authority to fix the rights  preferences and privileges of and issue up to  shares of preferred stock without stockholder action 
although we have no present intention to issue shares of preferred stock  such an issuance could have the effect of making it more difficult and less attractive for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
preferred stock may also have other rights  including economic rights senior to our common stock that could have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock 
in addition  the following factors could also delay or prevent a change in control our classified board  certain provisions of our charter  and certain provisions of our bylaws 
in addition  we are subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law 
this section provides that except in certain limited circumstances a corporation shall not engage in any business combination with any interested stockholder during the three year period following the time that such stockholder becomes an interested stockholder 
this provision could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of portal 
we received a letter from nasdaq stating that if we are unable to comply with the minimum bid price of  our common stock will be delisted we received a letter dated january  from the staff of the nasdaq stock market  or nasdaq  which notified us that the bid price for our common stock had been below per share for a period of thirty consecutive days 
nasdaq advised us that we would be given a period of ninety days within which to comply with the minimum bid price requirement in order to maintain the listing of our common stock on the nasdaq national market 
subsequently  nasdaq extended the period by an additional days to july on january   our stockholders approved an amendment of our certificate of incorporation to effectuate a reverse stock split of between for and for such a reverse split would have the effect of increasing the price per share 
the decision to effectuate the stock split and the specific ratio within the approved range is subject to the discretion of the board of directors 
however  there is no assurance that the market price per share of our common stock following the reverse stock split will remain in excess of the minimum bid price as required by nasdaq national market or that we will otherwise meet the requirements of the nasdaq national market for continued inclusion for trading on nasdaq 
a reverse stock split could negatively impact the value of our common stock by allowing additional downward pressure on the stock price as its relative value becomes grater following the reverse split 
in addition  liquidity of our common stock could be adversely affected by the reduced number of shares that would be outstanding after the reverse stock split 
it is our intent to comply with and meet the requirements for continued nasdaq national market listing 
financial difficulties of companies we have invested in could adversely affect our financial results we have made investments in several companies and may make investments in others in the future 
if at any time our investment in a company were deemed impaired  we may be required to reduce the book value of that investment  which would in turn reduce our earnings in that period 
such investments could be deemed impaired  for example  if the financial condition of those companies deteriorates 
we have reduced the value of some of 
table of contents these investments previously 
because the financial condition of these companies is outside our control  we cannot predict if  or when  we would be required to reduce the value of such investments 
as of january   we had approximately million total investment of million net of a million write down invested in other companies 
acquisitions of companies or technologies may result in further disruptions to our business and management due to difficulties in assimilating personnel and operations we may make acquisitions or investments in other companies  products or technologies 
if we make any acquisitions  we will be required to assimilate the operations  products and personnel of the acquired businesses and train  retain and motivate key personnel from the acquired businesses 
we may be unable to maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies if we fail in these efforts 
similarly  acquisitions may cause disruptions in our operations and divert management s attention from day to day operations  which could impair our relationships with our current employees  customers and strategic partners 
the issuance of equity securities for any acquisition could be substantially dilutive to our stockholders 
in addition  our profitability may suffer because of acquisition related costs or amortization costs for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about portal s risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements for the reasons described under the caption management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risks associated with portal s business and future operating results 
short term investment portfolio we do not hold derivative financial instruments in our short term investment portfolio 
our short term investments consist of instruments rated the equivalent of standard poor s and moody s short term rating a p or long term rating of at least a a this policy dictates that we diversify our holdings and limit our short term investments to a maximum of million to any one issuer 
our policy also dictates that all short term investments mature in months or less 
the following table presents the amounts of cash equivalents and investments that are subject to market risk and the weighted average interest rates  by year of expected maturity for portals investment portfolios as of january  this table does not include cash because cash is not subject to market risk 
it also does not include long term investments as they are held to maturity and  therefore  near term changes in market rates will not result in losses

maturing within year maturing within years thereafter total as of january  cash equivalents weighted average yield investments weighted average yield total portfolio weighted average yield impact of foreign currency rate changes during fiscal  most local currencies of our international subsidiaries strengthened against the us dollar 
because we translate foreign currencies into us dollars for reporting purposes  currency fluctuations can have an impact on our results 
for the fiscal year ended january   there was an immaterial currency exchange impact from our intercompany transactions 
to date  we have not engaged in foreign currency hedging 
as a global concern  we anticipate that our sales outside the united states will increasingly be denominated in other currencies 
in such event  we will face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations
