item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are engaged in the acquisition  development and production of natural gas and oil properties in the gulf of mexico and in the north sea 
we primarily focus our efforts on natural gas and oil properties with proved undeveloped reserves that are economically attractive to us but are not strategic to major or exploration oriented independent oil and gas companies 
we attempt to achieve a high return on our investment in these properties by limiting our up front acquisition costs and by developing our acquisitions quickly 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we routinely make estimates and judgments about the carrying value of our assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
such estimates and judgments are evaluated and modified as necessary on an ongoing basis 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies see note  summary of significant accounting policies and estimates  to our consolidated financial statements  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
oil and gas reserves the process of estimating quantities of natural gas and crude oil reserves is very complex  requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of all available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
the data for a given field may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including  but not limited to  additional development activity  evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
as a result  material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time 
although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible  the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various fields make these estimates generally less precise than other estimates included in the financial statement disclosures 
we use the units of production method to amortize our oil and gas properties 
this method requires us to amortize the capitalized costs incurred in developing a property in proportion to the amount of oil and gas produced as a percentage of the amount of proved reserves contained in the property 
accordingly  changes in reserve estimates as described above will cause corresponding changes in depletion expense recognized in periods subsequent to the reserve estimate revision 
see the supplemental information unaudited in our consolidated financial statements for reserve data related to our properties 
oil and gas producing activities we follow the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas properties 
under this method  lease acquisition costs and intangible drilling and development costs on successful wells and development dry holes are capitalized 
capitalized costs relating to producing properties are depleted on the units of production method 
proved developed reserves are used in computing unit rates for drilling and development costs and total proved reserves for depletion rates of leasehold  platform and pipeline costs 
estimated dismantlement  restoration and abandonment costs and estimated residual salvage values are taken into account in determining amortization and depletion provisions 
expenditures for geological and geophysical testing are generally charged to expense unless the costs can be specifically attributed to determining the placement for a future developmental well location 
expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred  renewals and betterments are capitalized 
the costs and related accumulated depreciation  depletion  and amortization of properties sold or otherwise retired are eliminated from the accounts  and gains or losses on disposition are reflected in the statements of operations 
we perform an impairment analysis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable 
an impairment allowance is provided on an unproved property when we determine that the property will not be developed 
to determine if a depletable unit is impaired  we compare the net carrying value of the depletable unit to the undiscounted future net cash flows by applying management s estimates of future oil and gas prices to the estimated future production of oil and gas reserves over the economic life of the property 
future net cash flows are based upon our independent reservoir engineer s estimate of proved reserves 
in addition  other factors such as probable and possible reserves are taken into consideration when justified by economic conditions and actual or planned drilling or other development activities 
for a property determined to be impaired  an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value of the impaired property will be recognized 
fair value  on a depletable unit basis  is estimated to be the present value of the aforementioned expected future net cash flows 
any impairment charge incurred is recorded in accumulated depreciation  depletion  impairment and amortization to reduce our recorded basis in the asset 
each part of this calculation is subject to a large degree of judgment  including the determination of the depletable units estimated reserves  future cash flows and fair value 
contingent liabilities in preparing financial statements at any point in time  management is periodically faced with uncertainties  the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time 
as discussed in part i  item legal proceedings and the notes to consolidated financial statements  we are involved in actions  which if determined adversely  could have a material negative impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
management  with the assistance of counsel makes estimates  if determinable  of atp s probable liabilities and records such amounts in the consolidated financial statements 
such estimates may be the minimum amount of a range of probable loss when no single best estimate is determinable 
disclosure is made  when determinable  of any additional possible amount of loss on these claims  or if such estimate cannot be made  that fact is disclosed 
along with our counsel  we monitor developments related to these legal matters and  when appropriate  we make adjustments to recorded liabilities to reflect current facts and circumstances 
although it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters  management believes that the recorded amounts  if any  are reasonable 
price risk management activities as of july   we performed the requisite steps to qualify our derivative instruments for hedge accounting treatment under the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  as amended 
under sfas all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
changes in the derivative s fair value are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
for qualifying cash flow hedges  the gain or loss on the derivative is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income loss to the extent the hedge is effective 
for qualifying fair value hedges  the gain or loss on the derivative is offset by related results of the hedged item in the statement of operations 
gains and losses on hedging instruments included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss are reclassified to oil and gas revenues in the period that the related production is delivered 
derivative contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are recorded as derivative assets and liabilities at market value in the consolidated balance sheet  and the associated unrealized gains and losses are recorded as current expense or income in the consolidated statement of operations 
prior to july   gains or losses from our derivative instruments were included in other income expense 
based on a critical assessment of our accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  management believes that our consolidated financial statements provide a meaningful and fair perspective of our company 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected financial and operating information for our natural gas and oil operations inclusive of the effects of price risk management activities years ended december  production natural gas mmcf    oil and condensate mbbls  total mmcfe    revenues in thousands natural gas    effects of risk management activities    total    oil and condensate    effects of risk management activities  total    natural gas  oil and condensate    effects of risk management activities    total    average sales price per unit natural gas per mcf effects of risk management activities per mcf total per mcf oil and condensate per bbl effects of risk management activities per mcf total per bbl natural gas  oil and condensate per mcfe effects of risk management activities per mcfe total per mcfe expenses per mcfe lease operating general and administrative depreciation  depletion and amortization represents the net loss on the settlement of derivatives attributable to actual production 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  for the year ended december   we reported a net loss of million  or per share as compared to a net loss of million  or per share in oil and gas revenue 
excluding the effects of settled derivatives  our revenue from natural gas and oil production for decreased compared to  from million to million 
this decrease was primarily due to an approximate decrease in our average sales price per mcfe from per mcfe in to in this decrease was partially offset by a increase in production volumes from bcfe to bcfe due primarily to two properties that were completed and began production in additionally  one property was completed in september but did not contribute a full year of production until early in the fourth quarter  we were forced to shut in a majority of our gulf of mexico production when hurricane lili  a category storm  blew through the central gulf 
our current production continues to be hampered by the damage wrought by hurricane lili and we estimated a fourth quarter impact of approximately bcfe 
we carry insurance  subject to normal deductibles  that covers both the physical damage and loss of production income  which will partially mitigate the financial impact of this hurricane 
marketing revenue 
revenues from natural gas marketing activities decreased to million in as compared to million in this decrease was due to a decrease in the sales price per mmbtu 
the average sales price per mmbtu decreased from in to in for more information regarding this marketing activity  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
lease operating expense 
our lease operating expense for increased from million per mcfe to million per mcfe 
this increase was primarily the result of an increase in the number of producing wells we own and an increase in their total production volume 
lease operating expense per mcfe increased due to higher than expected repairs and maintenance costs on our platforms and costs incurred related to the hurricane and tropical storm 
gas purchased marketing 
our cost of purchased gas was million for compared to million for the average gas cost decreased from per mmbtu in to per mmbtu in for more information regarding this marketing activity  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
geological and geophysical 
in  we recorded approximately million of costs related to the acquisition of d seismic data purchased for certain properties in the u 
k sector north sea 
in  we recorded million of these same costs on properties in both the gulf of mexico and the u 
k sector north sea 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense increased to million for compared to million for the primary reason for the increase was the result of higher compensation related costs in which was substantially offset by a bad debt allowance recorded in non cash compensation expense 
in  we recorded a non cash charge to compensation expense of approximately million for options granted since september through the date of our initial public offering ipo on february  the measurement date 
the total expected expense as of the measurement date is recognized in the periods in which the option vests 
each option is divided into three equal portions corresponding to the three vesting dates april   february   and february   with the related compensation cost for each portion amortized straight line over the period to the vesting date 
in  we recorded a non cash compensation expense of million for the above options and an additional non cash compensation expense of million related to certain options granted prior to september and exercised during the additional expense was recorded as a result of the manner in which those shares were exercised 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense dd a decreased from million in to million in the average dd a rate was per mcfe during compared to per mcfe during this decrease in the rate was attributable to impairments taken in  higher than expected costs of an abandonment completed in and a new property brought on line in with a lower average dd a rate than those properties producing in impairment expense 
on two of our properties in and eight of our properties in  the future undiscounted cash flows were less than their individual net book value 
as a result  we recorded impairments of million in and million in the impairments in were primarily the result of reductions in recoverable reserves 
the impairments in were primarily the result of drilling a non commercial development well million  a decrease in expected future gas prices and reductions in recoverable reserves 
the impairments were calculated as the difference between the carrying value and the estimated fair value of the impaired depletable unit 
other income expense 
effective july   we qualified for hedge accounting treatment under the provisions of sfas and began recording any gains or losses on settled derivative instruments as a component of oil and gas revenue 
the effective portion of any changes in the fair market value of open positions at the end of the period is recorded in other comprehensive income loss 
the loss on derivative instruments of million in represents amounts recorded prior to july  and is comprised of a realized loss of million for derivative contracts settled in the first half of and an unrealized loss of million representing the change in fair market value of the open derivative positions at june  in  we recorded a loss on derivative instruments of million 
the net loss in was comprised of a realized loss of million for derivative contracts settled in the period and an unrealized gain of million representing the change in fair market value of the open derivative positions at december  interest expense increased by million over due to amounts owed on a long term contract with a third party and we capitalized million of interest for the year ended december  related to one property in the uk sector north sea 
other income includes million of accrued insurance proceeds related to the loss of production from hurricane lili in october and the forgiveness of interest of million related to amounts owed on a long term contract with a third party 
we filed an insurance claim during the fourth quarter of covering the estimated damages and lost production from the gulf of mexico region resulting from the effects of hurricane lili in october our financial statements reflect probable amounts recoverable  net of deductibles  of approximately million for damages to ten properties and lost production on four properties through december  the total claim will be determined when the final documentation is received and approved and any remaining payment related to will be recorded when we have a firm settlement commitment from the insurance company 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  for the year ended december   we reported a net loss of million  or per share as compared to a net loss of million  or per share in oil and gas revenue 
excluding the effects of settled derivatives  our revenue from natural gas and oil production for increased over  from million to million 
this increase resulted from a slight increase in the price of natural gas and a increase in production  partially offset by a decrease in the price of oil 
the increase in production volumes from bcfe to bcfe was attributable to properties that were on production during that were not on production during this increase in production was offset by the natural decline in our existing offshore properties 
risk management activities  which were included in oil and gas revenues in would have decreased oil and natural gas revenues by million  or per mcfe in and decreased million  or per mcfe in marketing revenue 
revenues from natural gas marketing activities decreased to million in as compared to million in this decrease was due to a decrease in the sales price per mmbtu 
the average sales price per mmbtu decreased from in to in for more information regarding this marketing activity  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
lease operating expense 
our lease operating expense for increased from million to million 
this increase was primarily the result of an increase in the number of producing wells we own and an increase in their total production volume 
additionally  the lease operating expense per mcfe on those properties acquired in was higher due to cost structures and contract obligations in place at the time of acquisition 
transportation related costs increased million and workover spending decreased million as compared to gas purchased marketing 
our cost of purchased gas was million for compared to million for the average gas cost decreased from per mmbtu in to per mmbtu in for more information regarding this marketing activity  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
geological and geophysical 
in  we recorded million of costs related to the acquisition of d seismic data purchased for certain properties in the gulf of mexico and the uk sector north sea 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense increased to million for compared to million for the primary reason for the increase was the result of compensation and related expenses due to an increase in the number of employees in our houston office from at the end of to at the end of million and the opening of our uk office in the third quarter of million 
as a result of becoming a public company in  we incurred costs such as insurance  filing fees  professional fees  investor relations expenses and other expenses related to public company requirements million 
non cash compensation expense 
in  we recorded a non cash compensation expense of million 
a portion of the expense million is related to options granted from september to the date of our ipo and is based on the difference between the exercise price for those options and the fair market value of our stock as determined by the ipo price of per share 
the expense is recognized in the periods in which the options vest 
each option is divided into three equal portions corresponding to the three vesting dates  with the related compensation cost amortized straight line over the period between the ipo date and the vesting date 
the remaining expense million was related to certain options granted prior to september and exercised in the current year 
the expense was recorded on those exercises as the method in which those shares were exercised required us to account for the options under variable accounting 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense increased from million in to million in the average dd a rate was per mcfe during compared to per mcfe during impairment expense 
as of december   the future undiscounted cash flows for our properties were million and the net book value for the properties was million before current year impairment expense 
at december   the future undiscounted cash flows for our properties were million and the net book value for the properties was million before current year impairment expense 
however  on eight of our properties in and three of our properties in  the future undiscounted cash flows were less than their individual net book value 
as a result  we recorded impairments of million in and million in the impairments in were primarily the result of drilling a non commercial development well at our main pass property million  a decrease in expected future gas prices and reductions in recoverable reserves 
in  the impairments were primarily the result of a reduction in recoverable reserves individually attributable to the particular properties 
other income expense 
in  we recorded a loss on derivative instruments of million comprised of a realized loss of million and an unrealized gain of million 
the realized loss represents derivative contracts settled in  while the offsetting gain represents the fair market value of the open derivative positions at december  prior to the adoption of sfas  realized gains or losses were recorded as a component of revenue 
for we recorded an expense of million million realized and million unrealized on a natural gas derivative position as a result of our hedging position exceeding our expected production in an upcoming period 
in addition  we recorded an expense of million million realized and million unrealized related to losses associated with our written call option contracts 
in both of these situations in  we were required to account for the positions using the mark to market method 
interest expense decreased from million in to million in primarily due to lower debt levels following the use of proceeds from our ipo and as a result of lower interest rates 
we capitalized zero and million of interest for the years ended december  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources general we have financed our acquisition and development activities through a combination of project based development arrangements  bank borrowings and proceeds from our february ipo  as well as cash from operations and the sale on a promoted basis of interests in selected properties 
we intend to finance our near term development projects in the gulf of mexico and north sea through available cash flows and the potential sell down of interests in the development projects 
as operator of all of our projects in development  we have the ability to significantly control the timing of most of our capital expenditures 
we believe the cash flows from operating activities combined with our ability to control the timing of substantially all of our future development and acquisition requirements will provide us with the flexibility and liquidity to meet our future planned capital requirements 
however  future cash flows are subject to a number of variables including changes in the borrowing base  the level of production from our properties  oil and natural gas prices and the impact  if any  of commitments and contingencies 
future borrowings under credit facilities are subject to variables including the lenders practices and policies  changes in the prices of oil and natural gas and changes in our oil and gas reserves 
a material reduction in the borrowing base or the institution of a monthly reduction amount by our lenders would have a material negative impact on our cash flows and our ability to fund future obligations 
no assurance can be given that operations and other capital resources will provide cash in sufficient amounts to maintain planned levels of operations and capital expenditures 
historically  in periods of reduced availability of funds from either cash flows or credit sources we have delayed planned capital expenditures and will continue do to so when necessary 
while the delay decreases the amount of capital expenditures in the current period  it could negatively impact our future revenues and cash flows 
cash flows years ended december  in thousands cash provided by used in operating activities    investing activities    financing activities    operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities in was million compared to million in the change in accounts payable reflects the primary reason for this increase as we utilized a substantial portion of our operating cash flow in to reduce amounts owed to third parties 
this increase was partially offset by an decrease in our average sales price per mcfe 
restricted cash of million represents funds set aside to satisfy payment conditions in our drilling contract for development in the uk investing activities 
cash used in investing activities decreased in to million of which was for acquisition and development activities 
we incurred no costs for two acquisitions made in and approximately million for the acquisition of an undeveloped block in the gulf of mexico 
developmental capital expenditures in the gulf of mexico and the north sea were approximately million and million  respectively 
in  capital expenditures for acquisition and development were million and million  respectively  and million was used to purchase the overriding royalty interests associated with the repayment of our non recourse debt 
financing activities 
cash used in financing activities in represents net principal payments on our credit facility 
cash provided from financing activities in included the proceeds from our initial public offering in february of million  repayment of prior credit facilities of million and proceeds of million from our credit facility and promissory note 
amounts borrowed under our credit agreements were as follows for the dates indicated in thousands december  credit facility   note payable  net of unamortized discount of and    total debt   credit facility we have a million senior secured revolving credit facility which is secured by substantially all of our us oil and gas properties  as well as by approximately two thirds of the capital stock of our foreign subsidiaries and is guaranteed by our wholly owned subsidiary  atp energy  inc the amount available for borrowing under the credit facility is limited to the loan value  as determined by the bank  of oil and gas properties pledged under the facility 
at december   the borrowing base was million with no further scheduled borrowing base reduction 
if our outstanding balance exceeds our borrowing base at any time  we are required to repay such excess within days and our interest rate during the time an excess exists is increased by 
on march   we entered into an agreement with our lenders to defer our scheduled borrowing base redetermination until the next scheduled redetermination in may this agreement reaffirmed the current borrowing base of million and the borrowing base reduction amount of zero 
as part of this agreement we committed to reduce the amount outstanding under our borrowing base by million between march  and may  additionally  if the aggregate principal amount of the loan exceeds the required month end reductions of million  million and million during the period from march  to may   such principal amounts in excess of the applicable period limits shall bear interest at a per annum rate of interest equal to the adjusted reference rate plus 
further  the lenders agreed to raise the limit of advances available to be made to our foreign subsidiaries and specified certain future events which would require our foreign subsidiaries to return the incremental advances to the parent 
on march   we made a payment of million reducing our outstanding principal to million 
at the next scheduled redetermination in may  the lenders can increase or decrease the borrowing base and re establish the monthly reduction amount 
a material reduction in the borrowing base or a material increase in the monthly reduction amount by the lender would have a material negative impact on our cash flows and our ability to fund future operations 
advances under the credit facility can be in the form of either base rate loans or eurodollar loans 
the interest on a base rate loan is a fluctuating rate equal to the higher of the federal funds rate plus and the bank base rate  plus a margin of   or depending on the amount outstanding under the credit agreement 
the interest on a eurodollar loan is equal to the eurodollar rate  plus a margin of    or depending on the amount outstanding under the credit facility 
the credit facility matures in may our credit facility contains conditions and restrictive provisions  among other things  limiting us to enter into any arrangement to sell or transfer any of our material property  prohibiting a merger into or consolidation with any other person or sell or dispose of all or substantially all of our assets  maintaining certain financial ratios and limitations on advances to our foreign subsidiaries 
note payable effective june   we issued a note payable to a purchaser for a face principal amount of million which matures in june and bears interest at a fixed rate of per annum 
the note is secured by second priority liens on substantially all of our us oil and gas properties and is subordinated in right of payment to our existing senior indebtedness 
we executed an agreement in connection with the note which contains conditions and restrictive provisions and requires the maintenance of certain financial ratios 
upon consent of the purchaser  which shall not be unreasonably withheld  the note may be repaid prior to the maturity date with an additional repayment premium based on the percentage of the principal amount paid  ranging from during the first year to in the final year of payment 
if the note is paid at maturity  the maximum payment premium of is required 
the expected repayment premium is being amortized to interest expense straight line  over the term of the note which approximates the effective interest method 
the resulting liability is included in other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
in july  we received proceeds of million in consideration for the issuance of the note 
the discount of million is being amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method 
the amount available for borrowing under the note is limited to the loan value of oil and gas properties pledged under the note  as determined by the purchaser 
the purchaser has the right to make a redetermination of the borrowing base at least once every six months 
we were not notified of any change in the borrowing base in if our outstanding balance exceeds the borrowing base at any time  we are required to repay such excess within days subject to the provisions of the agreement 
a material reduction in the borrowing base by the lender would have a material negative impact on our cash flows and our ability to fund future obligations 
as of december   all of our borrowing base under the agreement was outstanding 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of the financial covenants of our credit facility and note payable agreements 
working capital at december   we had a working capital deficit of approximately million  an improvement over our working capital deficit of million at december  in compliance with the definition of working capital in our credit facility  which excludes current maturities of long term debt and the current portion of assets and liabilities from derivatives  we had working capital of approximately million at december  as compared to a deficit of approximately million at december  we believe the cash flows from operating activities combined with our ability to control the timing of substantially all of our future development and acquisition requirements will provide us with the flexibility and liquidity to meet our future planned capital requirements 
our planned development and acquisition programs are projected to be funded substantially by available cash flow from our operations 
we believe the cash flows from operating activities combined with our ability to control the timing of substantially all of our future development and acquisition requirements will provide us with the flexibility and liquidity to meet our future capital requirements 
in addition to these measures  we are currently in discussions with potential investors to provide additional capital 
these discussions involve increases to our current credit facilities  new credit facilities and the sale of interests in selected properties 
we have also explored the possibility of the issuance of new debt or equity 
completion of any of these potential financings would expand our capabilities to further reduce our outstanding indebtedness  improve our working capital position and may allow us to expand or accelerate our future development and acquisition programs 
there can be no assurance however  that we will be successful in negotiating any of these transactions or that the form of the transaction will be acceptable to both the potential investor and our management or our board of directors 
commitments we have various commitments primarily related to leases for office space  other property and equipment and other agreements 
we expect to fund these commitments with cash generated from operations

contingencies on august  atp entered into a written agreement to acquire a property in the gulf of mexico during september on october  the agreement was amended to ultimately extend the closing date until october  in exchange for payments made by atp totaling million 
this amendment also contained an arrangement whereby if atp did not close on the property  and if sellers sold the property to a third party with a sale that met specific contract requirements  atp would be required to execute a six month note for payment of the differential 
since atp did not obtain the financing for the acquisition by october   the transaction did not close by that date  however  the parties intensive work toward closing continued beyond that date without interruption 
while working on the closing for the property with atp  the sellers sold the property to a third party without informing atp until after the closing had taken place 
atp filed an action in the district court of harris county  texas against the sellers  generally alleging improper sale of the offshore property to a third party and breach of contract  and seeking unspecified damages from the sellers 
the case is encaptioned atp oil gas corporation vs 
legacy resources co  lp et al  no 
in the th judicial district court of harris county  texas 
at the same time sellers notified atp of their sale to a third party  the sellers had a demand made upon atp for execution of a six month note for the amount of an alleged differential of approximately million plus interest at 
substantiation of the amount and validity of the demand could not be ascertained based on the content of the demand received 
atp contested the entire demand 
the judge has abated the litigation  until arbitration pursuant to the underlying agreements between the sellers and atp is completed 
a tentative date of may  has been scheduled for the arbitration with an alternative date in september due to the inherent uncertainties involving contested facts and legal issues a prediction as to the likely outcome cannot be made with any degree of certainty  and we have not accrued any amount related to this matter 
while we are seeking recovery of the amounts previously paid and discussed above  the million has been charged to earnings along with other costs related to this matter 
atp intends to vigorously defend against the sellers claims and forcefully pursue its own claims in this matter 
in august  burlington resources inc filed suit against atp alleging formation of a contract with atp and our breach of the alleged contract 
the complaint seeks compensatory damages of approximately million 
we believe that this claim is without merit  and we intend to defend it vigorously 
in we purchased three properties in the uk sector north sea for approximately million 
in accordance with the purchase agreement  we also committed to pay future consideration contingent upon the successful development and operation of the properties 
the contingent consideration for each property includes amounts to be paid upon achieving first commercial production and upon achieving designated cumulative production levels 
active development is in progress on our helvellyn property and future development is planned on the other two properties 
first commercial production from the helvellyn property may occur sometime in the first half of although a significant portion of the work required has been completed  there remains significant additional work to be performed before this property can produce commercially 
that work includes completion  hook up  and testing of the pipeline and production facilities and final negotiation of certain terms in our transportation and processing agreements 
accordingly  there can be no assurance of eventual production from this development until the aforementioned activities are completed successfully 
at such time  the required amount will accrued for payment to the seller and capitalized as acquisition costs 
we are also  in the ordinary course of business  a claimant and or defendant in various legal proceedings 
management does not believe that the outcome of these legal proceedings  individually  and in the aggregate will have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
sfas provides accounting requirements for retirement obligations associated with tangible long lived assets  including the timing of liability recognition  initial measurement of the liability  allocation of asset retirement cost to expense  subsequent measurement of the liability  and financial statement disclosures 
sfas requires that an asset retirement cost should be capitalized as part of the cost of the related long lived asset and subsequently allocated to expense using a systematic and rational method 
the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  and we adopted the statement on january  the transition adjustment resulting from the adoption of sfas will be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
we have not yet completed our assessment of the impact of sfas on our financial condition and results of operations 
however  we expect that adoption of the statement will result in increases in the capitalized costs of our oil and properties and in the recognition of additional liabilities related to asset retirement obligations 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 no 
 and no 
 amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections sfas 
among other things  sfas requires gains and losses from early extinguishment of debt to be included in income from continuing operations instead of being classified as extraordinary items as previously required by generally accepted accounting principles 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after may  and we adopted the statement on january  any gain or loss on early extinguishment of debt that was classified as an extraordinary item in periods prior to adoption must be reclassified into income from continuing operations 
the adoption of sfas will require the million net of tax of extraordinary loss for the year ended december  to be reclassified to interest expense and income tax benefit 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullified emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
sfas also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
the provisions of this statement are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  we adopted the provisions of sfas on january  and the adoption did not have an effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
this statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  to provide alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
it also amends the disclosure provisions of that statement to require prominent disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an entity s accounting policy decisions with respect to stock based employee compensation 
finally  this statement amends accounting principles board opinion no 
 interim financial reporting apb  to require disclosure about those effects in interim financial information 
we intend to continue to account for stock based compensation based on the provisions of apb opinion no 
the amended disclosure requirements have been incorporated in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantee of indebtedness of others fin 
fin requires that upon issuance of a guarantee  the guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee 
fin s provisions for initial recognition and measurement should be applied on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure provisions apply to financial statements for periods ending after december  we do not currently have guarantees that require disclosure

 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
fin requires a company to consolidate a variable interest entity if it is designated as the primary beneficiary of that entity even if the company does not have a majority of voting interest 
a variable interest entity is generally defined as an entity where its equity is unable to finance its activities or where the owners of the entity lack the risk and rewards of ownership 
the provisions of fin apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
the adoption of fin is not currently expected to have an effect on our financial position or results of operations when adopted

factors that may affect future results you should carefully consider the risks described below in evaluating the other statements made herein 
the risks described below are not the only risks of our company 
additional risks not presently known to us  or that we currently deem immaterial  may also impair our business operations 
our business  financial condition  results of operations or the trading price of our common stock could be adversely affected by any of these risks 
we have debt  trade payables and related interest payment requirements that may restrict our future operations and impair our ability to meet our obligations 
our debt  trade payables and related interest payment requirements may have important consequences 
for instance  it could 
make it more difficult or render us unable to satisfy our financial obligations  
require us to dedicate a substantial portion of any cash flow from operations to the payment of interest and principal due under our debt  which will reduce funds available for other business purposes  
increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  
limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  
place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to some of our competitors that have less financial leverage  and 
limit our ability to obtain additional financing required to fund working capital and capital expenditures and for other general corporate purposes 
our ability to satisfy our obligations and to reduce our total debt depends on our future operating performance and on economic  financial  competitive and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
we cannot provide assurance that our business will generate sufficient cash flow or that future financings will be available to provide sufficient proceeds to meet these obligations 
the successful execution of our business strategy and the maintenance of our economic viability are also contingent upon our ability me meet our financial obligations 
our debt instruments impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to successfully operate our business 
our bank credit facility and our fixed rate note contain customary restrictions  including covenants limiting our ability to incur additional debt  grant liens  make investments  consolidate  merge or acquire other businesses  sell assets  pay dividends and other distributions  make capital expenditures and enter into transactions with affiliates 
we also are required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of our bank credit facilities 
these restrictions may make it difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy or to compete in our industry with companies not similarly restricted 
our bank credit facility matures in may and our note matures in june  at which time we will be required to repay or refinance those borrowings 
we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain replacement financing at that time or that any available replacement financing will be on terms acceptable to us 
if we are unable to obtain acceptable replacement financing  we will not be able to satisfy our obligations under our bank credit facility or note due in and may be required to take other actions to avoid defaulting on those facilities  including selling assets or surrendering assets to our lenders  which would not otherwise be in our long term economic interest 
our properties are subject to rapid production declines and we require significant capital expenditures to replace our reserves at a faster rate than companies whose reserves have longer production periods 
we may not be able to identify or complete the acquisition of properties with sufficient proved reserves to implement our business strategy 
production of reserves from reservoirs in the gulf of mexico generally declines more rapidly than production from reservoirs in many other producing regions of the world 
this results in recovery of a relatively higher percentage of reserves from properties in the gulf of mexico during the initial years of production 
as our reserves decline from production  we must incur significant capital expenditures to replace declining production 
as a result  in order to increase our reserves  we must replace our reserves with newly acquired properties 
also  our return on capital for a particular property depends significantly on prices prevailing during the relatively short production period of that property 
as of december  and  our reserve life index was years and years  respectively 
we may not be able to identify or complete the acquisition of properties with sufficient proved undeveloped reserves to implement our business strategy 
as we deplete our existing reserves we must identify  acquire and develop properties through new acquisitions or our level of production and cash flows will be adversely affected 
the availability of properties for acquisition depends largely on the divesting practices of other natural gas and oil companies  commodity prices  general economic conditions and other factors that we cannot control or influence 
a substantial decrease in the availability of proved oil and gas properties in our areas of operation  or a substantial increase in the cost to acquire these properties  would adversely affect our ability to replace our reserves 
our actual drilling results are likely to differ from our estimates of proved reserves 
we may experience production that is less than estimated in our reserve reports and drilling costs that are greater than estimated in our reserve reports 
such differences may be material 
estimates of our natural gas and oil reserves and the costs associated with developing these reserves may not be accurate 
development of our reserves may not occur as scheduled and the actual results may not be as estimated 
drilling activity may result in downward adjustments in reserves or higher than estimated costs 
our estimates of our proved natural gas and oil reserves and the estimated future net revenues from such reserves are based upon various assumptions  including assumptions required by the sec relating to natural gas and oil prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
this process requires significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
therefore  these estimates are inherently imprecise and the quality and reliability of this data can vary 
any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and pv of reserves set forth in this annual report 
our properties may also be susceptible to hydrocarbon drainage from production by other operators on adjacent properties 
in addition  we will likely adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history  results of development  prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
actual production  revenues  taxes  development expenditures and operating expenses with respect to our reserves may vary materially from our estimates 
if we are not able to generate sufficient funds from our operations and other financing sources  we may not be able to finance our planned development activity or acquisitions or service our debt 
we have historically needed and will continue to need substantial amounts of cash to fund our capital expenditure and working capital requirements 
our ongoing capital requirements consist primarily of funding acquisition  development and abandonment of oil and gas reserves and to meet our debt service obligations 
our capital expenditures were million during  million during and million during for  we plan to finance anticipated expenses  debt service and acquisition and development requirements with funds generated from the following sources 
cash provided by operating activities  
funds available under new credit facilities  
the potential increased availability from our existing credit facilities  
extended financing arrangements with suppliers and service providers  
net cash proceeds from the sale of assets  debt or equity  and 
the potential issuance of new debt or equity 
our projected cash flows provide the necessary funds for our debt service and our planned gulf of mexico developments and we intend to finance our planned north sea development with projected cash flows and potential new financing arrangements 
low commodity prices  production problems  disappointing drilling results and other factors beyond our control could reduce our funds from operations and may restrict our ability to obtain additional financing 
in addition  financing may not be available to us in the future on acceptable terms or at all 
in the event additional capital is not available  we may curtail our acquisition  drilling  development and other activities or be forced to sell some of our assets on an untimely or unfavorable basis 
in addition  we may not be able to pay interest and principal on our debt obligations 
natural gas and oil prices are volatile  and low prices have had in the past and could have in the future a material adverse impact on our business 
our revenues  profitability and future growth and the carrying value of our properties depend substantially on the prices we realize for our natural gas and oil production 
because approximately of our estimated proved reserves as of december  were natural gas reserves  our financial results are more sensitive to movements in natural gas prices 
our realized prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital 
historically  the markets for natural gas and oil have been volatile  and they are likely to continue to be volatile in the future 
for example  natural gas and oil prices increased significantly in late and steadily declined in  only to climb again in among the factors that can cause this volatility are 
worldwide or regional demand for energy  which is affected by economic conditions  
the domestic and foreign supply of natural gas and oil  
weather conditions  
domestic and foreign governmental regulations  
political conditions in natural gas or oil producing regions  
the ability of members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries to agree upon and maintain oil prices and production levels  and 
the price and availability of alternative fuels 
it is impossible to predict natural gas and oil price movements with certainty 
lower natural gas and oil prices may not only decrease our revenues on a per unit basis but also may reduce the amount of natural gas and oil that we can produce economically 
a substantial or extended decline in natural gas and oil prices may materially and adversely affect our future business  financial condition  results of operations  liquidity and ability to finance planned capital expenditures 
further  oil prices and natural gas prices do not necessarily move together 
our price risk management decisions may reduce our potential gains from increases in commodity prices and may result in losses 
we periodically utilize derivative instruments with respect to a portion of our expected production 
these instruments expose us to risk of financial loss if 
production is less than expected  
the other party to the derivative instrument defaults on its contract obligations  or 
there is an adverse change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the derivative instrument and actual prices received 
our results of operations may be negatively impacted by our derivative instruments in the future and these instruments may limit any benefit we would receive from increases in the prices for natural gas and oil 
for the years ended december   and  we realized a loss of million  million and million  respectively 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk for volume and price information on our price risk management activities 
we may incur substantial impairment writedowns 
if management s estimates of the recoverable reserves on a property are revised downward or if natural gas and oil prices decline  we may be required to record additional non cash impairment writedowns in the future  which would result in a negative impact to our financial position 
in addition  future writedowns to our properties could result in corresponding reductions of our borrowing base under our credit facility and promissory note 
we review our proved oil and gas properties for impairment on a depletable unit basis when circumstances suggest there is a need for such a review 
to determine if a depletable unit is impaired  we compare the carrying value of the depletable unit to the undiscounted future net cash flows by applying management s estimates of future oil and gas prices to the estimated future production of oil and gas reserves over the economic life of the property 
future net cash flows are based upon our independent reservoir engineer s estimate of proved reserves 
in addition  other factors such as probable and possible reserves are taken into consideration when justified by economic conditions 
for each property determined to be impaired  we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the property on a depletable unit basis 
fair value is estimated to be the present value of the aforementioned expected future net cash flows 
any impairment charge incurred is recorded in accumulated depreciation  depletion  impairment and amortization to reduce our recorded basis in the asset 
each part of this calculation is subject to a large degree of judgment  including the determination of the depletable units estimated reserves  future cash flows and fair value 
we recorded impairments of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
management s assumptions used in calculating oil and gas reserves or regarding the future cash flows or fair value of our properties are subject to change in the future 
any change could cause impairment expense to be recorded  impacting our net income or loss and our basis in the related asset 
any change in reserves directly impacts our estimate of future cash flows from the property  as well as the property s fair value 
additionally  as management s views related to future prices change  the change will affect the estimate of future net cash flows and the fair value estimates 
changes in either of these amounts will directly impact the calculation of impairment 
the natural gas and oil business involves many uncertainties and operating risks that can prevent us from realizing profits and can cause substantial losses 
our development activities may be unsuccessful for many reasons  including cost overruns  equipment shortages and mechanical difficulties 
moreover  the successful drilling of a natural gas or oil well does not ensure a profit on investment 
a variety of factors  both geological and market related  can cause a well to become uneconomical or only marginally economic 
in addition to their cost  unsuccessful wells can hurt our efforts to replace reserves 
the natural gas and oil business involves a variety of operating risks  including 
fires  
explosions  
blow outs and surface cratering  
uncontrollable flows of natural gas  oil and formation water  
pipe  cement  subsea well or pipeline failures  
casing collapses  
embedded oil field drilling and service tools  
abnormally pressured formations  and 
environmental hazards  such as natural gas leaks  oil spills  pipeline ruptures and discharges of toxic gases 
if we experience any of these problems  it could affect well bores  platforms  gathering systems and processing facilities  which could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations 
we could also incur substantial losses as a result of 
injury or loss of life  
severe damage to and destruction of property  natural resources and equipment  
pollution and other environmental damage  
clean up responsibilities  
regulatory investigation and penalties  
suspension of our operations  and 
repairs to resume operations 
offshore operations are also subject to a variety of operating risks peculiar to the marine environment  such as capsizing  collisions and damage or loss from hurricanes or other adverse weather conditions 
these conditions can cause substantial damage to facilities and interrupt production 
as a result  we could incur substantial liabilities that could reduce or eliminate the funds available for development or leasehold acquisitions  or result in loss of equipment and properties 
terrorist attacks or similar hostilities may adversely impact our results of operations 
the impact that future terrorist attacks or regional hostilities particularly in the middle east may have on the energy industry in general  and on us in particular  is not known at the time 
uncertainty surrounding military strikes or a sustained military campaign may affect our operations in unpredictable ways  including disruptions of fuel supplies and markets  particularly oil  and the possibility that infrastructure facilities  including pipelines  production facilities  processing plants and refineries  could be direct targets of  or indirect casualties of  an act of terror or war 
moreover  we have incurred additional costs since the terrorist attacks of september  to safeguard certain of our assets and we may be required to incur significant additional costs in the future 
the terrorist attacks on september  and the changes in the insurance markets attributable to such attacks have made certain types of insurance more difficult for us to obtain 
there can be no assurance that insurance will be available to us without significant additional costs 
a lower level of economic activity could also result in a decline in energy consumption which could adversely affect our revenues or restrict our future growth 
instability in the financial markets as a result of terrorism or war could also affect our ability to raise capital 
our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover some liabilities or losses which we may incur 
the occurrence of a significant accident or other event not fully covered by our insurance could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition 
our insurance does not protect us against all operational risks 
we do not carry business interruption insurance at levels that would provide enough funds for us to continue operating without access to other funds 
for some risks  we may not obtain insurance if we believe the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented 
because third party drilling contractors are used to drill our wells  we may not realize the full benefit of workmen s compensation laws in dealing with their employees 
in addition  pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable 
we may be unable to identify liabilities associated with the properties that we acquire or obtain protection from sellers against them 
the acquisition of properties with proved undeveloped reserves requires us to assess a number of factors  including recoverable reserves  development and operating costs and potential environmental and other liabilities 
such assessments are inexact and inherently uncertain 
in connection with the assessments  we perform a review of the subject properties  but such a review will not reveal all existing or potential problems 
in the course of our due diligence  we may not inspect every well  platform or pipeline 
we cannot necessarily observe structural and environmental problems  such as pipeline corrosion  when an inspection is made 
we may not be able to obtain contractual indemnities from the seller for liabilities that it created 
we may be required to assume the risk of the physical condition of the properties in addition to the risk that the properties may not perform in accordance with our expectations 
the unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs  equipment  supplies  personnel and oilfield services could adversely affect our ability to execute on a timely basis our development plans within our budget 
shortages or an increase in cost of drilling rigs  equipment  supplies or personnel could delay or adversely affect our operations  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in periods of increased drilling activity in the gulf of mexico  we may experience increases in associated costs  including those related to drilling rigs  equipment  supplies and personnel and the services and products of other vendors to the industry 
increased drilling activity in the gulf of mexico also decreases the availability of offshore rigs 
these costs may increase further and necessary equipment and services may not be available to us at economical prices 
competition in our industry is intense  and we are smaller and have a more limited operating history than some of our competitors in the gulf of mexico and in the north sea 
we compete with major and independent natural gas and oil companies for property acquisitions 
we also compete for the equipment and labor required to operate and to develop these properties 
some of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than us 
in addition  larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of any changes in federal  state and local laws and regulations more easily than we can  which would adversely affect our competitive position 
these competitors may be able to pay more for natural gas and oil properties and may be able to define  evaluate  bid for and acquire a greater number of properties than we can 
our ability to acquire additional properties and develop new and existing properties in the future will depend on our ability to conduct operations  to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment 
in addition  some of our competitors have been operating in the gulf of mexico and in the north sea for a much longer time than we have and have demonstrated the ability to operate through industry cycles 
our success depends on our management team and other key personnel  the loss of any of whom could disrupt our business operations 
our success will depend on our ability to retain and attract experienced geoscientists and other professional staff 
as of december   we had engineers  geologist geophysicists and other technical personnel in our houston office and five engineers  geologist geophysicists and other technical personnel in our london location 
we depend to a large extent on the efforts  technical expertise and continued employment of these personnel and members of our management team 
if a significant number of them resign or become unable to continue in their present role and if they are not adequately replaced  our business operations could be adversely affected 
rapid growth may place significant demands on our resources 
we have experienced rapid growth in our operations and expect that significant expansion of our operations will continue 
our rapid growth has placed  and our anticipated future growth will continue to place  a significant demand on our managerial  operational and financial resources due to 
the need to manage relationships with various strategic partners and other third parties  
difficulties in hiring and retaining skilled personnel necessary to support our business  
the need to train and manage a growing employee base  and 
pressures for the continued development of our financial and information management systems 
if we have not made adequate allowances for the costs and risks associated with this expansion or if our systems  procedures or controls are not adequate to support our operations  our business could be adversely impacted 
we are subject to complex laws and regulations  including environmental regulations that can adversely affect the cost  manner or feasibility of doing business 
development  production and sale of natural gas and oil in the us  especially in the gulf of mexico  and in the north sea  are subject to extensive laws and regulations  including environmental laws and regulations 
we may be required to make large expenditures to comply with environmental and other governmental regulations 
matters subject to regulation include 
discharge permits for drilling operations  
bonds for ownership  development and production of oil and gas properties  
reports concerning operations  and 
taxation 
under these laws and regulations  we could be liable for personal injuries  property damage  oil spills  discharge of hazardous materials  remediation and clean up costs and other environmental damages 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative  civil and criminal penalties 
moreover  these laws and regulations could change in ways that substantially increase our costs 
accordingly  any of these liabilities  penalties  suspensions  terminations or regulatory changes could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
members of our management team own a significant amount of common stock  giving them influence or control in corporate transactions and other matters  and the interests of these individuals could differ from those of other shareholders 
members of our management team beneficially own approximately of our outstanding shares of common stock 
as a result  these shareholders are in a position to significantly influence or control the outcome of matters requiring a shareholder vote  including the election of directors  the adoption of an amendment to our articles of incorporation or bylaws and the approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions 
their control of atp may delay or prevent a change of control of atp and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of other shareholders 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates 
changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and the interest rate paid on borrowings under the credit facility 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
foreign currency risk 
the net assets  net earnings and cash flows from our wholly owned subsidiary in the uk are based on the uk dollar equivalent of such amounts measured in the applicable functional currency 
these foreign operations have the potential to impact our financial position due to fluctuations in the local currency arising from the process of re measuring the local functional currency in the us dollar 
we have not utilized derivatives or other financial instruments to hedge the risk associated with the movement in foreign currencies 
commodity price risk our revenues  profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and oil 
prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow and raise additional capital 
the amount we can borrow under our bank credit facility is subject to periodic re determination based in part on changing expectations of future prices 
lower prices may also reduce the amount of natural gas and oil that we can economically produce 
we currently sell a portion of our natural gas and oil production under price sensitive or market price contracts 
we periodically use derivative instruments to hedge our commodity price risk 
we hedge a portion of our projected natural gas and oil production through a variety of financial and physical arrangements intended to support natural gas and oil prices at targeted levels and to manage our exposure to price fluctuations 
we may use futures contracts  swaps and fixed price physical contracts to hedge our commodity prices 
realized gains and losses from our price risk management activities are recognized in oil and gas sales when the associated production occurs 
for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  the unrecognized gains and losses are included as a component of other comprehensive income loss to the extent the hedge is effective 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes 
our internal hedging policy provides that we examine the economic effect of entering into a commodity contract with respect to the properties that we acquire 
we generally acquire properties at prices that are below the management s estimated value of the estimated proved reserves at the then current natural gas and oil prices 
we may enter into short term hedging arrangements if we are able to obtain commodity contracts at prices sufficient to secure an acceptable internal rate of return on a particular property or on a group of properties or if deemed necessary by the terms of our existing credit agreements 
during  we hedged approximately of our natural gas and oil production 
to calculate the potential effect of the derivative and fixed price contracts on future income loss before taxes  we applied the nymex oil and gas strip prices as of december  to the quantity of our oil and gas production covered by those contracts as of that date 
the following table shows the estimated potential effects of the derivative and fixed price contracts on future income loss before taxes in thousands estimated increase decrease in income loss before taxes due to decrease increase instrument in prices in prices natural gas swaps   oil swaps natural gas fixed price contracts   oil fixed price contracts
