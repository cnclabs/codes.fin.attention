item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we operate primarily through two business segments the companion animal group cag and the food and environmental group feg 
cag comprises our veterinary diagnostic products and services  veterinary pharmaceutical products  and veterinary information products and services 
feg comprises our water testing products  dairy testing products and our production animal testing products 
additionally  other is primarily comprised of corporate research and development  ceo succession charge and interest income 
business overview the following is a discussion of the strategic and operating factors that we believe have the most significant effect on the performance of our business 
companion animal group our cag segment accounted for approximately of our sales in and is therefore our most significant business 
the largest product lines within our cag segment are instruments and instrument consumables  laboratory services  and rapid assays  which accounted for  and of cag revenues  respectively  in to date  revenues from sales of pharmaceutical products have not been substantial 
however  we are investing significantly in a pipeline of companion animal pharmaceutical products 
if we are successful in developing  obtaining fda approval for  and marketing these products  we believe that sales of pharmaceutical products will become a more material component of cag sales in the future 
by offering to companion animal veterinarians a broad range and an integrated set of proprietary diagnostic products and services  therapeutics and practice management computer systems  we believe we have developed a strong customer franchise  providing us a strategic advantage over companies with more narrow product or service offerings 
our complementary products and services give us scale in sales and distribution in this market  and permit us to offer programs such as practice developer  a customer reward that encourages purchases across multiple categories and builds customer loyalty 
by offering both point of care diagnostics for use in the clinic and outside laboratory services  we are able to develop integrated disease management solutions that leverage the advantages of both point of care and laboratory testing 
in addition  by integrating our practice management software systems with our instruments and with our reference laboratories  we enhance the veterinary practices of our customers by facilitating the flow of medical information in the clinic 
in the us  we sell instrument consumables  rapid assays and pharmaceuticals through distributors  and therefore our reported sales of these products are sales made to distributors  rather than sales to veterinarians  the end users 
because distributor inventory levels and purchasing patterns may fluctuate  sales of a particular product line in a particular period may not always be representative of the underlying customer demand for the product 
therefore  we closely track sales of these products by our distributors to the clinics clinic level sales  which we think provides a more accurate picture of the real growth rate for these products 
in the discussion of results below  we note certain instances where we believe reported sales have been influenced  positively or negatively  by changes in distributor inventories 
instruments and instrument consumables 
our instrument strategy is to provide veterinarians within integrated set of instruments called idexx vetlab that  individually and together  provide superior diagnostic information in the clinic  enabling veterinarians to practice better medicine and build more profitable practices 
we derive substantial revenues from the sale of consumables that are used in these instruments 
during the early stage of an instrument life cycle  we derive relatively greater revenues from instrument placements  while consumable sales become relatively more significant in later stages as the installed base of instruments increases and instrument placements begin to decline 
our long term success in this area of our business is dependent on our ability both to develop and sell new instruments with enhanced diagnostic capabilities and to maximize customer utilization of those instruments  which creates more consumables sales 
we have a large installed base of vettest chemistry analyzers  and substantially all of our revenues from that product line are now derived from consumables sales  although we continue to place instruments through an active rental program in the us and through sales in europe and asia pacific 
as a result  the success of this product line is dependent on increased customer utilization of those instruments 
toward that end  we seek to educate veterinarians about best medical practices that emphasize the importance of blood chemistry testing for a variety of diagnostic purposes 
in the fourth quarter of  we introduced our new hematology analyzer  the lasercyte system  which provides more extensive hematological diagnostic information than our original platform  the qbc vetautoread system 
our success in growing hematology revenues over the next several years will depend upon our ability to sell lasercyte instruments  although we intend to continue to sell the qbc vetautoread system 
we do not intend to rent lasercyte instruments 
at earlier stages in the life cycle of this product  a substantial portion of lasercyte placements will be made at veterinary clinics that already own our qbc vetautoread instruments 
as a result  net consumables sales are not likely to grow significantly in the near future  as we expect the increase in lasercyte consumable sales to be largely offset by declines in sales of qbc vetautoread consumables 
however  we believe that the enhanced diagnostic capabilities of the lasercyte system will lead veterinarians to perform more in clinic hematology testing  which will increase consumables sales as our installed base of lasercyte systems increases 
in addition  since we produce the lasercyte consumables  the profitability of these consumables is greater than the profitability of the qbc vetautoread consumables  which we purchase as finished products 
with all of our instrument lines  we seek to differentiate our products based on superior system capability  quality of diagnostic information  reliability and customer service 
our equipment and consumables typically are sold at a premium price to competitive offerings 
our success depends on our ability to maintain a premium price strategy 
in addition  our in clinic instrumentation competes with outside laboratory services for similar diagnostic information  and such services are typically offered at a lower cost 
therefore  our success also depends on our ability to market the relative attractiveness of in clinic diagnostic testing  versus less convenient and timely  but lower priced  laboratory testing 
laboratory services 
we believe that more than half of all diagnostic testing by us veterinarians is done at outside reference laboratories such as our idexx laboratory services laboratories 
we attempt to differentiate our laboratory testing services from those of our competitors primarily on the basis of quality  customer service and technology 
revenue growth in this business is achieved both through increased sales at existing laboratories and through the acquisition of new customers 
profitability of this business is largely the result of our ability to achieve efficiencies from both volume and operational improvements 
rapid assays 
our rapid assay business comprises single use kits for in clinic testing and microwell based kits for large clinic and laboratory testing for canine and feline diseases and conditions 
our two principal product lines are canine heartworm products which include the snap dx heartworm antigen  ehrlichia canis and lyme antibody combination test and the snap fiv antibody felv antigen combination test 
our rapid assay strategy is to develop  manufacture  market and sell proprietary tests with superior performance that address important medical needs 
as in our other lines of business  we also seek to differentiate our products through superior customer support 
these products carry price premiums over competitive products that do not offer equivalent performance and diagnostic capabilities  and which do not include a similar level of support 
we augment our product development and customer service efforts with marketing programs that enhance medical awareness and understanding regarding our target diseases and the importance of diagnostic testing 
food and environmental group water and dairy testing 
our strategy in the water testing business is to develop  manufacture  market and sell proprietary products with superior performance  supported by exceptional customer service 
our customers are primarily water utilities to whom strong relationships and customer support are very important 
over the past several years the rate of growth of this product line has slowed from over to approximately in the decline in growth rate is the result of increased competition and market penetration 
international sales of water testing products represent of total water product sales and we expect that future growth in this business will be significantly dependent on our ability to increase international sales 
growth also will be dependent on our ability to enhance and broaden our product line 
most water microbiological testing is driven by regulation  and in many countries a test may not be used for regulatory testing unless it has been approved by the applicable regulatory body 
as a result  we maintain an active regulatory program under which we are seeking regulatory approvals in a number of countries  primarily in europe 
we follow a similar strategy in marketing and selling our dairy testing products 
production animal services 
we develop  manufacture  market and sell a broad range of tests for various poultry  cattle and swine diseases and conditions  and have an active research and development and in licensing program in this area 
our strategy is to offer proprietary tests with superior performance characteristics 
disease outbreaks are episodic and unpredictable and certain diseases that are prevalent at one time may be substantially contained or eradicated 
in response to outbreaks  testing initiatives may lead to exceptional demand for certain products in certain periods 
conversely  successful eradication programs may result in significantly decreased demand for certain products 
the performance of this business  therefore  can be subject to fluctuation 
in  approximately of our sales in this business were international 
because of the significant dependence of this business on international sales  the performance of the business is particularly subject to the various risks described below that are associated with doing business internationally 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
inventory our inventories include material  labor and overhead  and are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
we write down inventory for estimated obsolescence when warranted by our estimates of future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those estimated by management  additional inventory write downs may be required  which would have a negative effect on our results of operations 
certain major components of our inventory are discussed in more detail below 
nitazoxanide 
our nitazoxanide product for the treatment of equine protozoal myeloencephalitis epm is in registration with the us food and drug administration fda 
we have completed the manufacturing  efficacy and safety components of our submission  and in february we submitted revised labeling and freedom of information act summary information as requested by the fda 
our inventories as of december  included million of inventory associated with the nitazoxanide product  consisting of million of active ingredient and million of other raw materials 
the million of active ingredient included in inventory at december  will expire in in the manufacturer of the active ingredient submitted additional stability data to the fda  which supported extending the shelf life of the active ingredient from to months from the date of manufacture 
upon use of unexpired active ingredient in the manufacture of finished goods  the active ingredient shelf life is no longer relevant 
the shelf life of the finished goods is measured from the date of manufacture  regardless of the age of the active ingredient used to manufacture the finished goods 
based on stability data that we have submitted to the fda  we believe that the shelf life of the finished goods will be at least months if and when the product is approved by the fda 
we evaluate our nitazoxanide inventory on a quarterly basis for realizability 
during the year ended december   we incurred no further write downs for this inventory due to expected product expiration 
our quarterly evaluation is based upon the expiration dates described  assumptions regarding the timing of fda approval and our launch of the product and assumptions regarding sales volumes that we expect to achieve following approval and launch of the product 
we believe that the product will be approved in late and launched shortly thereafter  that the worldwide market for epm treatments is approximately million annually  and that our nitazoxanide product will capture approximately of that market over four years following launch 
should fda approval be delayed beyond or should sales volumes be lower than those assumed  additional active ingredient would expire and would need to be written off 
for example  if fda approval was obtained in late  but sales volumes over the next four years were fifty percent lower than anticipated  and assuming a shelf life of months for finished goods inventory  approximately million of additional inventory would expire and require a charge to operations 
if we do not receive fda approval of the nitazoxanide product  and if we then elect to terminate our license to use the active ingredient  we have the right to require our supplier to repurchase the active ingredient at a price equal to our cost 
we have no assurances that our supplier has the financial ability to repurchase all of this inventory 
to the extent we were unable to sell the active ingredient to our supplier  we would incur a loss in the amount of any unrecovered costs of the active ingredient 
this could result in a loss of up to the full value of our net inventory  or million as of december  vettest slides 
our inventories as of december  included million of slides used in our vettest chemistry instruments  which represents approximately turns based on recent historical usage 
most of the slides have a shelf life of months at the date of manufacture 
the average remaining shelf life at december  was months 
in addition  we are required to purchase a minimum of million of slides over the remaining life of our contract with ortho clinical diagnostics  inc ortho  which expires on december   although our purchase obligation may be extended at our option through december  we evaluate potential losses over the life of the ortho contract on a quarterly basis 
our quarterly evaluation is based on an estimate of the value of slides that we are required to purchase under the contract but that will expire before sale 
the estimated loss is calculated based on the expiration dating described  and an evaluation of our minimum contractual purchase obligations relative to assumptions regarding i the per customer growth in demand for slides over the life of the contract  and ii changes over the life of the contract in the size of our installed base of vettest customers resulting from a new vettest instrument placements by us and b loss of customers who switch to other chemistry analyzers supplied by idexx or its competitors 
we have assumed that the rate of growth of end customer unit sales of vettest slides  which grew approximately in  will decline over the life of the ortho contract due to the impact of the factors described in the preceding sentence 
during the quarter ended september   we amended the contract with ocd to reduce our minimum purchase commitment for both and the life of the contract by million slides or approximately million in consideration for our agreement to forego approximately million of certain volume rebates on slides purchased in as a result of this amendment  we do not believe we will incur a loss on the contract and we have reversed the previously established contract loss reserve of million  of which million was provided in however  if our assumptions regarding the per customer demand for slides or the changes in the installed base of vettest instruments are incorrect  we could incur loss on this contract 
for example  if we experienced no per customer growth in demand for slides through the contract term  we would incur a loss of approximately million 
lasercyte hematology instrument 
as of december   our inventories included million of component parts and finished goods associated with our lasercyte hematology instrument  which we began shipping to customers in november in addition  we have placed million in deposits with vendors to secure additional critical components and we have firm purchase commitments of an additional million 
we expect to fully realize our investment and purchase commitments 
however  if we alter the design of this product  we may be required to write off some or all of the associated inventory 
the nitazoxanide  vettest slides and lasercyte products are included in our cag segment 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to the following significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  failure to obtain obtain regulatory approval of certain products  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  and significant advancements or changes in technology 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based on a change in events and circumstances discussed above  we measure any impairment based on factors such as projected cash flows 
net intangible assets and goodwill amounted to million as of december   consisting of million related to veterinary laboratories of which million represents goodwill  million related to water test products of which million represents goodwill  million related to veterinary pharmaceutical products of which million represents goodwill and million of other of which million represents goodwill 
in  we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
and as a result  we ceased to amortize goodwill  but continued to amortize all other intangibles 
we had recorded approximately million of goodwill amortization on these amounts during the year ended december  and would have recorded approximately million of goodwill amortization during the same period in  if the existing standards had been continued 
in addition  we recorded million of other intangible amortization during the year ended december  and million during the year ended december  in lieu of goodwill amortization  we were required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in and are now required to perform annual impairment reviews 
no impairment was found as a result of either our initial impairment review or our year end review 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab no 

sab no 
requires that four criteria are met before revenue is recognized 
these include i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  iii the seller s price is fixed and determinable  and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue at the time of shipment including to distributors for substantially all products  as title and risk of loss pass to the customer on delivery to the common carrier 
we recognize revenue on sales to leasing companies after the instrument or practice information management system is installed and the customer has accepted the instrument or system 
we recognize revenue on sales of certain instruments after the instrument is installed  where installation is considered essential to the usability of the instrument  and the customer has accepted the instrument 
we recognize service revenue at the time the service is performed 
we recognize revenue associated with extended maintenance agreements ratably over the life of the contracts 
we recognize revenue from non cancelable software licenses and hardware systems upon installation of the software and completion of training if applicable or hardware because at this time collection is probable and we have no significant further obligations 
we recognize revenue on certain instrument systems under rental programs over the life of the rental agreement 
when instruments are sold together with extended maintenance agreements  we allocate revenue to the extended maintenance agreement the undelivered element based on amounts charged separately to similar customers and recognize those revenues ratably over the period of the agreement 
the residual value is recognized as instrument revenue when appropriate under the policies described above 
shipping costs reimbursed by the customer are included in revenue and cost of sales 
we record estimated reductions to revenue in connection with customer programs and incentive offerings  which may give customers future rights such as free or discounted goods or services or trade in rights 
we estimate these reductions based on our experience with similar customer programs in prior years 
our distributors do not have the right to return products 
we recognize revenue only in those situations where collection from the customer is probable 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we base our estimates on our historical collection and write off experience  current trends  credit policy  detailed analysis of specific client situations and percentage of our accounts receivable by aging category 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payment  additional allowances would be required 
income taxes we account for income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this statement requires that we recognize a current tax liability or asset for current taxes payable or refundable and a deferred tax liability or asset for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences and carryforwards to the extent they are realizable 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have recorded a valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets that relate to international net operating loss carryforwards 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
we do not provide for us income taxes on earnings of our subsidiaries outside of the us as of december   we had unremitted earnings in subsidiaries outside the us of million  on which no us taxes have been provided 
our intention is to reinvest these earnings permanently or to repatriate the earnings only when tax effective to do so 
it is not practical to estimate the amount of additional taxes that might be payable upon repatriation of foreign earnings 
warranty reserves we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
our actual warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  which are based on historical data and engineering estimates  where applicable  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
as of december   we had accrued  for estimated warranty expense 
warranty expense was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we launched our lasercyte system in october  and expect sales will increase in and beyond 
we expect that sales of this system will cause warranty expense to increase significantly in we will charge warranty expense to the cost of lasercyte sales based upon our experience with instrument sales and engineering information about the system 
should actual warranty expense exceed our estimates  our cost of sales of lasercyte systems would increase 
results of operations twelve months ended december  compared to twelve months ended december revenue total company

the following table presents revenue for the company and its operating segments net sales in thousands dollar change percentage change cag    feg    total    companion animal group 
revenue for cag increased million  or  to million from million in the same period of the prior year 
an increase in sales of laboratory services approximately million  or resulted primarily from higher volume worldwide and  to a lesser extent  price increases in the u

and the impact of currency exchange rates on sales at our laboratories outside the us an increase in sales of instrument consumables approximately million  or resulted primarily from increased unit sales of vettest slides worldwide and  to a lesser extent  the impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside of the us the increase in revenues was positively impacted by depressed sales that resulted from a late marketing program that pulled sales into revenues were negatively impacted due to a decrease in distributor inventories of instrument consumables in we believe  however  that reported growth in consumables sales approximates the underlying growth rate after adjusting for these two factors 
sales of lasercyte  a hematology instrument introduced in october  contributed million to the revenue increase 
an increase in sales of rapid assay products approximately million  or resulted primarily from increased clinic level sales of canine heartworm and feline test kits  offset primarily by the negative impact of changes in distributor inventory levels which increased million in and decreased million in  and increased accruals on sales of canine heartworm test kits due to higher customer participation in avolume rebate program 
after adjusting for these changes in distributor inventory levels  sales of rapid assay products would have increased approximately million  or 
an increase in sales of veterinary practice management software and services approximately million  or  resulted primarily from higher volume of complete system sales  and increased hardware upgrade sales 
offsetting these increases were reduced sales of our qbc vetautoread hematology instrument approximately million  or  primarily due to a shift in marketing and customer focus to the lasercyte system 
sales of pharmaceutical products decreased slightly due to a decline in sales of the company s acarexx feline ear mite treatment  offset partially by increased sales of pzi vet insulin  which was launched on a commercial basis in food and environmental group 
revenue for feg increased million  or  to million from million for the same period of the prior year 
an increase in sales of poultry and livestock tests approximately million  or resulted primarily from higher unit sales of livestock products and  to a lesser extent  price increases on livestock products and the impact of currency exchange rates on sales outside of the us approximately half of the increased sales of livestock products were the result of government sponsored testing initiatives in germany  which may not continue through an increase in sales of water testing products approximately million  or resulted primarily from increased unit sales volume in europe and the americas and  to a lesser extent  price increases in the us a decrease in sales of dairy testing products approximately million or was primarily attributable to lower unit sales volume as a result of increased competition

gross profit for cag increased million  or  to million from million in the same period of the prior year  primarily due to increased sales volume across the cag product lines  partially offset by a reduction in the gross profit percentage 
as a percentage of cag revenue  gross profit declined from for the same period in the prior year to 
the decrease in gross profit percentage was attributable primarily to foreign exchange hedge contract losses in the current period compared to gains in the prior period  increased amortization due to additional placements of vettest instruments in our rental and trade up programs  and a net unfavorable change in manufacturing variances 
these factors were offset partially by productivity improvements across cag product lines  partly due to increased revenue spread against the fixed cost portion of our expense base  the positive impact of the strengthening of the euro and british pound on sales denominated in those currencies  reversal of an accrual for potential loss on our vettest slide supply agreement with ortho as a result of a reduction in our minimum purchase obligations under the agreement  and higher prices  primarily on laboratory services and feline test kits 
food and environmental group 
gross profit for feg increased million  or  to million from million for the same period in the prior year  primarily due to increased sales volume across the feg product lines 
as a percentage of feg revenue  gross profit was unchanged at 
gross profit percentage benefited from a favorable mix of higher margin poultry and livestock products  higher prices for water testing and livestock products  and the positive impact of the strengthening of the euro and british pound on revenue 
these increases were offset by higher inventory writedowns of certain dairy products and royalty accruals on certain livestock products

this decrease resulted primarily from the impact of adoption of sfas no 
under which the company ceased amortizing goodwill  a reduction in severance and related costs  a reduction in marketing expense associated with feline diagnostic products due to a direct to consumer marketing campaign in  a reduction in bad debt expense  and savings from the consolidation of our pharmaceuticals and companion animal diagnostics sales forces 
these decreases were offset partially by increased spending on sales and marketing including the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange to support higher sales volumes  litigation spending  net of a settlement received  related to the company s patent infringement lawsuit against abaxis  inc and sa scientific  inc  and increased research and development expenses 
food and environmental group 
operating expenses for feg increased million  or  to million from million in the same period of the prior year

liquidity and capital resources we fund the capital needs of our business through cash generated from operations 
at december  and  we had million and million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  respectively  and working capital of million and million  respectively 
as of december  and  we also had long term investments in debt securities of million and million  respectively 
in connection with the acquisition of genera in august  we issued million in notes payable to a former shareholder of genera  of which million was secured by cash in escrow  and the remaining million was unsecured 
in april  we repaid million  of which million was paid from the cash held in escrow 
the remaining unsecured portion of million is noninterest bearing  has been discounted to yield and is due in three annual installments  beginning in august the noteholder elected to defer the august payment of million  which now bears interest at and is due on demand 
in september we entered into a million uncommitted line of credit with a large multi national bank 
under the terms of this agreement the bank retained the right to approve all borrowings and all borrowings were due on demand 
any borrowings under this line would have borne interest at the bank s prime rate 
this agreement expired in october there were no loans outstanding under this agreement at the time of expiration 
in january we entered into a million uncommitted line of credit with another large multi national bank 
under the terms of this agreement  the bank will retain the right to approve all borrowings and all borrowings will be due on demand 
any borrowings under this line will bear interest at the mutually agreed upon rate at the time of borrowing 
effective january   the company entered into a workers compensation insurance policy where the company retains the first  in claim liability per incident and up to million in claim liability in the aggregate 
the insurance company administers and pays these claims and the company reimburses the insurance company for the company s portion of these claims 
the company also agreed to issue a  letter of credit to the insurance company as security for these claims 
previously  the company was fully insured for workers compensation liabilities 
we do not expect that this change in insurance coverage will have an unfavorable impact on our total workers compensation costs 
we purchased approximately million in fixed assets and million in other long term assets during the year ended december   principally related to the cag segment 
our total capital budget for is approximately million 
research and development expense as a percentage of revenue for is expected to be consistent with levels 
under certain supply agreements with suppliers of veterinary instruments  slides for our vettest instruments and certain raw materials  at december  we had aggregate commitments to purchase approximately million of products in cash provided by operating activities was million during cash of million was provided by an increase in accrued expenses attributable primarily to increased liabilities for marketing programs  payroll  taxes  royalties  and the ceo succession charge

we believe that current cash  short term investments  long term investments  debt facilities and funds generated from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future 
future operating results the future operating results of idexx involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
actual events or results may differ materially from those discussed in this report 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  the factors discussed below as well as those discussed elsewhere in this report 
idexx s future growth depends on several factors our ability to grow our business in the future depends upon our ability to successfully implement various strategies  including developing  manufacturing and marketing new products with new features and capabilities  including pharmaceutical products  expanding our market by increasing use of our products by our customers  strengthening our sales and marketing activities in geographies outside of the us  developing and implementing new technology development and licensing strategies  and identifying and completing acquisitions that enhance our existing businesses or create new business areas for us 
however  we may not be able to successfully implement some or all of these strategies and increase or sustain our rate of growth 
the markets in which idexx competes are competitive and subject to rapid and substantial technological change we face intense competition within the markets in which we sell our products and services 
we expect that future competition will become even more intense  and that we will have to compete with changing and improving technologies 
some of our competitors and potential competitors  including large pharmaceutical companies  have substantially greater capital  manufacturing  marketing and research and development resources than we do 
idexx s products and services are subject to various government regulations in the us  the manufacture and sale of our products are regulated by agencies such as the us department of agriculture usda  us food and drug administration fda and the us environmental protection agency epa 
most diagnostic tests for animal health applications  including our canine  feline and poultry and livestock tests  must be approved by the usda prior to sale 
our water testing products must be approved by the epa before they may be used by customers in the us as a part of a water quality monitoring program required by the epa 
our pharmaceutical and dairy testing products require approval by the fda 
any failure to comply with regulatory requirements relating to the manufacture and sale of our products could result in fines and sanctions against us or removals of our products from the market  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we have entered into an agreement with the fda under which we have agreed  among other things  to perform specified lot release and stability testing of our snap beta lactam products and to provide related data to the fda 
if the fda were to determine that one or more lots of product failed to meet applicable criteria for product performance or stability  the fda could take various actions  including requiring us to recall products or restricting our ability to sell these products 
sales of dairy antibiotic residue testing products were million in commercialization of animal health pharmaceuticals in the us requires prior approval by the fda 
to obtain such approvals we are required to submit substantial clinical  manufacturing and other data to the fda 
regulatory approval for products submitted to the fda may take several years and following approval  the fda continues to regulate all aspects of the manufacture  labeling  storage  record keeping and promotion of pharmaceutical products 
we have several animal pharmaceutical products in registration with the fda  including a nitazoxanide product for treatment of equine protozoal myeloencephalitis and a non steroidal anti inflammatory for the treatment of lameness in horses 
failure to obtain  or delays in obtaining  fda approval for these products would have a negative impact on our future growth 
idexx s future operating results may be negatively impacted by various factors factors such as the introduction and market acceptance of new products and services  the mix of products and services sold and the mix of domestic versus international revenue could negatively impact our future operating results 
we sell many of our products  including substantially all of the rapid assays and instrument consumables sold in the us  through distributors 
as a result  changes in the timing and size of distributor purchases can result in lower revenue for us because our revenue for each quarter is usually generated from orders received during that quarter 
our financial performance  therefore  is subject to an unexpected downturn in product demand and may be unpredictable 
while our pharmaceutical products are under development  we may carry related active ingredients  other raw materials and finished goods as assets on our balance sheet when recovery of the asset value from future sales is deemed probable 
to the extent that these inventories become unusable due to unanticipated delays in obtaining fda approval for these products  or to our failure to obtain such approvals  we may be required to write down those inventories  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates 
we are actively developing new diagnostic platforms  including new instrument systems 
in connection with these programs  we are developing production machinery and equipment 
as of december   we had million of these fixed assets on our balance sheet 
were we to discontinue any such programs  we would be required to write off the associated production machinery and equipment 
such a write off could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we believe that more than half of all veterinary diagnostic testing occurs in laboratories 
although we have a significant laboratory business  our in clinic testing business is more material to our results of operations 
if testing by companion animal veterinarians generally were to shift towards increased laboratory testing and away from in clinic testing  this shift could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our expense levels are based in part on expectations of future revenue levels 
therefore  a loss in expected revenue could result in a disproportionate decrease in our net income 
idexx s success is heavily dependent upon its proprietary technologies we rely on a combination of patent  trade secret  trademark and copyright law to protect our proprietary rights 
if we do not have adequate protection of our proprietary rights  our business may be affected by competitors who develop substantially equivalent technologies that compete with us 
we cannot assure that we will obtain issued patents  that any patents issued or licensed to us will remain valid  or that any patents owned or licensed by us will provide protection against competitors with similar technologies 
even if our patents cover products sold by our competitors  the time and expense of litigating to enforce our patent rights could be substantial  and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in the past we have received notices claiming that our products infringe third party patents and we may receive such notices in the future 
patent litigation is complex and expensive and the outcome of patent litigation can be difficult to predict 
we cannot assure that we will win a patent litigation case or negotiate an acceptable resolution to such a case 
if we lose  we may be stopped from selling certain products and or we may be required to pay damages and or ongoing royalties as a result of the lawsuit 
any such adverse result could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
idexx purchases materials for its products from a limited number of sources we currently purchase certain products and materials from single sources or a limited number of sources 
some of the products that we purchase from these sources are proprietary  and therefore may not be available from other sources 
these products include our chemistry and hematology analyzers and related consumables  active ingredients for pharmaceutical products and certain components of our snap devices and water testing products 
if we are unable to obtain adequate quantities of these products in the future  then we could face cost increases or reductions or delays in product shipments  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
the slides sold for use in our vettest instruments are purchased under an agreement with ocd at fixed prices 
under this agreement we are required to purchase a minimum of million of slides over the remaining life of the contract 
to the extent that slides purchased under the contract exceed demand for the slides  we may incur losses in the future under this agreement 
to the extent that we are unable to maintain current pricing levels on sales of slides to our customers  our profits on slide sales would decline because we purchase slides at fixed prices 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates 
international revenue accounts for a significant portion of idexx s total revenue various risks associated with foreign operations may impact our international sales 
possible risks include fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies  disruptions in transportation of our products  the differing product and service needs of foreign customers  difficulties in building and managing foreign operations  import export duties and quotas  and unexpected regulatory  economic or political changes in foreign markets 
prices that we charge to foreign customers may be different than the prices we charge for the same products in the us due to competitive  market or other factors 
as a result  the mix of domestic and international sales in a particular period could have a material impact on our results for that period 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our financial market risk consists primarily of foreign currency exchange risk 
we operate subsidiaries in foreign countries and transact business in local currencies 
we attempt to hedge our cash flow on intercompany sales to minimize foreign currency exposure 
the primary purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the volatility associated with foreign currency transactions 
corporate policy prescribes the range of allowable hedging activity 
we primarily utilize forward exchange contracts and options with a duration of less than months 
gains and losses related to qualifying hedges of foreign currency from commitments or anticipated transactions are deferred in prepaid expenses or accrued liabilities and are included in the basis of the underlying transaction 
as of december   the company had million in unrealized losses on foreign exchange contracts designated as hedges 
based on our overall currency rate exposure at december   including local currency revenues and expenses  the impact of hedge contracts and balances denominated in a currency other than the company s or its subsidiaries functional currency  a strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies will reduce operating income by approximately million and a weakening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies will reduce operating income by approximately million 
a strengthening of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies  excluding the impact of hedge contracts currently in place  would reduce operating income by approximately million and the effects of a weakening of us dollar relative to foreign currencies  excluding the impact of hedge contracts currently in place  would increase operating income by approximately million
