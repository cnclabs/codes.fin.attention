critical accounting policies and estimates the company s management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of the company s financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities

the different types of estimates that are required to be made by management in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements vary significantly in the level of subjectivity involved in their determination 
management has identified the estimates below as those which contain a relatively higher level of subjectivity in their determination and therefore could have a more material effect upon the company s reported results had management used different assumptions 
impairment testing of intangible assets in performing its annual impairment testing of goodwill and fcc licenses  which are both considered to be intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  management must make a significant number of assumptions and estimates in applying a fair value based test 
to assist in this process  the company utilizes the services of an independent valuation consulting firm 
see note of the consolidated financial statements 
the assumptions and estimates required under the impairment testing of goodwill and fcc licenses included future market revenue growth  operating profit margins  cash flow multiples  market revenue share  and the company s weighted average cost of capital  among others 
furthermore  the impairment testing for fcc licenses required management to identify and value a number of previously unrecognized intangible assets in an allocation of fair values consistent with the purchase price allocation method prescribed by sfas and relevant pronouncements of the emerging issues task force

investment carrying values the company has investments in nonconsolidated affiliates  which are accounted for under the equity method if the company s equity interest is from to  and under the cost method if the company s equity interest is less than and the company does not exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies 
management reviews the carrying value of investments on an ongoing basis and adjusts them to reflect net realizable value  where necessary 
see note of the consolidated financial statements 
as part of its analysis and determination of the net realizable value of investments  management must make assumptions and estimates regarding expected future cash flows  which involves assessing the financial results  forecasts  and strategic direction of the investee companies 
in addition  management must make assumptions regarding discount rates  market growth rates  revenue multiples  comparable company valuations and other factors 
had management utilized different assumptions and estimates in its assessment of the net realizable value of investments  the carrying values of the company s investments as of december  may have been different 
management considers the assumptions used in its determination of investment carrying values to be reasonable

in calculating the company s pension expense for the year ending december   management anticipates using an assumed expected long term rate of return of 
management considers the assumptions used in its determination of projected benefit obligations and net pension cost to be reasonable 
pension assumptions sensitivity analysis the weighted average assumptions used in computing the company s net pension cost and projected benefit obligation have a significant effect on the amounts reported 
a one percentage point change in each of the assumptions below would have the following effects upon net pension cost and projected benefit obligation  respectively  in the year ended and as of december  one percentage point increase one percentage point decrease discount rate expected long term rate of return rate of compensation increase discount rate expected long term rate of return rate of compensation increase in thousands net pension cost projected benefit obligation management has identified the accounting policies below as critical to the company s business operations and the understanding of its results of operations
