critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap necessarily requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenues  bad debts  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed at the time to be reasonable under the circumstances 
under different assumptions or conditions  the actual results will differ  potentially materially  from those previously estimated 
many of the conditions impacting these assumptions and estimates are outside of the company s control 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue the company currently derives all of its revenues from licenses of software products and related services 
revenue is recognized in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions  and to the extent applicable  securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition in financial statements 
product license revenue is recognized under sop when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the fee is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility is probable and supported and the arrangement does not require services that are essential to the functionality of the software 
i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists the company determines that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists with respect to a customer under a an executed license agreement  which is signed by both the customer and the company  or b a purchase order  quote or binding letter of intent received from and signed by the customer  in which case the customer has either previously executed a license agreement with the company or will receive a shrink wrap license agreement with the software 
the company does not offer product return rights to end users or resellers 
ii delivery has occurred the company s software may be either physically or electronically delivered to the customer 
the company determines that delivery has occurred upon shipment of the software pursuant to the billing terms of the arrangement or when the software is made available to the customer through electronic delivery 
customer acceptance generally occurs at shipment 
iii the fee is fixed or determinable if at the outset of the customer arrangement  the company determines that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is typically recognized when the arrangement fee becomes due and payable 

table of contents iv collectibility is probable and supported the company determines whether collectibility is probable and supported on a case by case basis 
the company may generate a high percentage of its license revenue from its current customer base  for whom there is a history of successful collection 
the company assesses the probability of collection from new customers based upon the number of years the customer has been in business and a credit review process  which evaluates the customer s financial position and ultimately their ability to pay 
if the company is unable to determine from the outset of an arrangement that collectibility is probable based upon its review process  revenue is recognized as payments are received 
with regard to software arrangements involving multiple elements  the company allocates revenue to each element based on the relative fair value of each element 
the company s determination of fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
the company limits its assessment of vsoe for each element to the price charged when the same element is sold separately 
the company has analyzed all of the elements included in its multiple element arrangements and has determined that it has sufficient vsoe to allocate revenue to consulting services and post contract customer support pcs components of its license arrangements 
the company sells its consulting services separately  and has established vsoe for these services on this basis 
vsoe for pcs is determined based upon the customer s annual renewal rates for these elements 
accordingly  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  revenue from perpetual licenses is recognized upon delivery using the residual method in accordance with sop  and revenue from pcs is recognized ratably over the respective term of the maintenance contract  typically one year 
services revenue consists of fees from consulting services and pcs 
consulting services include needs assessment  software integration  security analysis  application development and training 
the company generally bills consulting services fees on a time and materials basis 
the company s consulting services are not essential to the functionality of its software 
the company s software products are fully functional upon delivery and implementation and generally do not require any significant modification or alteration for customer use 
customers purchase consulting services to facilitate the adoption of the company s technology and may dedicate personnel to participate in the services being performed  but they may also decide to use their own resources or appoint other professional service organizations to provide these services 
software products are billed separately from professional services 
the company recognizes revenue from consulting services as services are performed 
the company s customers typically purchase pcs annually  and the company prices pcs based on a percentage of the product license fee 
customers purchasing pcs receive product upgrades  web based technical support and telephone hot line support 
network revenues consist of revenues earned from customers under an application service provider asp model 
under this model  customers pay a monthly fee that entitles them to use of the company s software on a secure  hosted  third party server 
these revenues are recognized as the services are provided on a monthly basis over the term of the customer s contract 
with respect to these revenues  the company s customers pay exclusively for the right to use the software  but do not receive the right to take possession of the company s software 
further  it is not possible for customers to either run the software on their own hardware or for them to contract with another party unrelated to the company to host the software 
customer advances and billed amounts due from customers in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customer s financial condition and if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would likely be required 
actual collections could differ materially from our estimates 
investments 
from time to time the company may hold minority interests in companies having operations or technology in areas within its strategic focus  some of which are publicly traded and have highly volatile share prices 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of companies in whom the company has invested could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 

table of contents the company records an investment impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
income taxes 
the company records a valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets when management believes it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
management considers factors such as the reversal of deferred income tax liabilities  projected taxable income  the character of the income tax asset and tax planning strategies 
a change to these factors could impact the estimated valuation allowance and income tax expense 
long lived assets 
the company s long lived assets consist of property  plant and equipment and other acquired intangibles  excluding goodwill 
we periodically review our long lived assets for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
for assets to be held and used  the company initiates its review whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of an asset group is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows without interest charges that the asset group is expected to generate 
if it is determined that an asset group is not recoverable  an impairment loss is recorded in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its fair value 
assets to be disposed of and for which we have a plan to dispose of the assets  whether through sale or abandonment  are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
litigation 
the company is a party  from time to time  in legal proceedings 
in these cases  management assesses the likelihood that a loss will result  as well as the amount of such loss and the financial statements provide for the company s best estimate of such losses 
to the extent that any of these legal proceedings are resolved and result in the company being required to pay an amount in excess of what has been provided for in the financial statements  the company would be required to record  against earnings  such excess at that time 
if the resolution resulted in a gain to the company  or a loss less than that provided for  such gain is recognized when received or receivable 
valuation of intangible assets 
the company has a history of acquiring other businesses  and expects that this trend will likely continue in the future 
as part of the completion of any business combination  the company is required to value any intangible assets acquired at the date of acquisition 
this valuation is inherently subjective  and necessarily involves judgments and estimates regarding future cash flows and other operational variables of the entity acquired 
however  there can be no assurance that the judgments and estimates made will reflect future performance of the acquired entity 
to assist management with the valuation process  the company has adopted the practice of using independent valuation experts in the valuation process for intangible assets acquired through material acquisitions 
however  if either management or the independent experts make judgments or estimates that differ from actual circumstances  the company may be required to write off certain of its intangible assets 
results of operations the following table presents  for the periods indicated  certain components of the selected financial data of the company as a percentage of total revenues 
the historical results are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any future period 

table of contents year ended june  revenues license networking customer support service total revenues cost of revenues license networking customer support service total cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative depreciation amortization of acquired intangible assets total operating expenses income from operations other income loss interest income interest expense income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income for the year fiscal compared with fiscal revenues 
total revenues included license and networking revenues  customer support revenues  and service revenues 
total revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal revenues from license and networking increased from million in fiscal to million fiscal the increase in license and networking revenues was a result of several factors  including the company s focus on certain industry verticals for its solution offerings 
in particular  the emergence of strong performance in the pharmaceutical  government  and financial services sectors contributed to the company s fiscal license and networking revenue growth 
also contributing to license and networking revenue growth were the acquisitions completed during fiscal specifically  approximately million of license revenue was recorded during the fiscal year relating to the fiscal acquisitions 
additionally  the introduction of packaged services offerings pso s  which are small components of code licensed as point solutions designed to address very specific issues faced by customers further contributed to the company s growth in license revenues 
pso revenue totaled approximately million during fiscal during fiscal  the company also saw the continued return of large license transactions  a trend that began during the fourth quarter of fiscal networking revenues during fiscal totaled million  as compared with million during fiscal as has been the case with many companies in the networking sector  the company has found this to be a continued difficult business in which to achieve revenue growth 

table of contents customer support revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in customer support revenues resulted from several factors 
the increase in the number of licenses granted in fiscal  as well as strong renewal rates for maintenance contracts for existing customers  had a positive impact on customer support revenues 
over the past year  the company has effectively implemented price increases in all regions for its customer support services and those increases have contributed to the revenue growth achieved in fiscal additionally  the company s customer support organization began to offer to customers in fiscal a number of value added support programs 
the acquisitions in fiscal also contributed to the growth in customer support revenues  since fiscal s customer support revenues include a partial year of revenues from these acquisitions  while fiscal doesn t include any customer support revenues for these newly acquired businesses 
approximately of the growth in customer support revenues relates to the fiscal acquisitions  while the remaining growth relates to the company s organic business 
renewal rate of maintenance contracts for the company s products is in excess of 
service revenues decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in service revenues was primarily attributable to the continued challenging market for services engagements globally 
although in aggregate the company s service revenue decreased slightly from fiscal to fiscal  the company experienced an increase in livelink related service engagements 
the company also generated consulting and integration revenues relating to customers of the acquired companies totaling approximately  during fiscal these increases were more than offset  however  by a decrease in services revenue relating to certain of the company s older products 
given the difficult service environment  the company is currently focusing on delivering services solutions which have been effective for other customers as opposed to trying to deliver unique consulting solutions to each customer 
also included in services revenues for each of fiscal and fiscal was approximately million relating to the company s user s conferences hosted each year 
cost of revenues 
cost of license and networking revenues consisted primarily of the costs associated with the royalties payable to third parties whose software is bundled in the company s products  as well as product media  duplication  manuals  packaging expenses  and finder s fees 
cost of license and networking revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of license and networking revenues  the cost of license and networking revenues increased slightly from during fiscal to during fiscal the increase in cost of license and networking revenues in absolute dollars is a reflection of the increase in license and networking revenues 
the increase in cost of license and networking revenues as a percentage of license and networking revenues is due to higher third party product costs included in the licenses during fiscal associated largely with the acquired companies products 
cost of networking revenues was  in fiscal compared with  in fiscal cost of customer support revenues is comprised primarily of technical support personnel and their related costs 
cost of customer support revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily as a result of increased personnel costs in fiscal as compared with fiscal increased personnel costs relating to the company s core operations increased approximately million  while the impact of the company s fiscal acquisitions totaled approximately  the most significant component of which were personnel costs 
as a percentage of customer support revenues  customer support costs decreased slightly from in fiscal to in fiscal  reflective of the fact that the company has effectively restructured the acquired companies cost structures and that the company is realizing some economies of scale as its support organization continues to grow 
cost of service revenues consisted primarily of the costs of providing integration  customization and training 
cost of service revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal cost of service revenues as a percentage of service revenues increased from in fiscal to in fiscal  additional costs assumed as a result of the fiscal acquisitions accounted for approximately  of the increase in absolute dollars in costs of service revenues compared with fiscal also impacting costs of service revenues is the fact that in fiscal the company recorded approximately  less of investment tax credits through its services organization  due to the fact that the amount of investment tax credits recorded during fiscal was an atypically high amount 
investment tax credits are recorded as a credit to cost of service revenues 
consequently  once the impact of the acquisitions and investment tax credits are removed  the company s core services organization actually realized a decrease in costs in fiscal as compared with fiscal 
table of contents this decrease in core cost of services is a result of both a slight decrease in personnel costs related to lower personnel in the company s services organization during fiscal  as well as lower expenses incurred with respect to the company s user s conferences as compared with fiscal research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consisted primarily of engineering personnel expenses  contracted research and development expenses  and facilities and equipment costs 
to date the company has expensed all research and development costs as incurred 
research and development expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and  as a percentage of total revenues  remained relatively consistent at in both fiscal and the increase in research and developments expenses in absolute dollars in fiscal primarily resulted from approximately million of additional expenses added as part of the integration of the acquired companies development organizations 
the increase in research and development expense in fiscal as compared with fiscal also resulted from the fact that in fiscal the company recorded approximately  less in investment tax credits  which are recorded as a reduction to research and development expenses 
the investment tax credits recorded during fiscal were an atypically high amount  and are not considered to be indicative of claims expected to be made in the foreseeable future 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consisted primarily of compensation of sales and marketing personnel  as well as expenses associated with advertising  trade shows  facilities and other expenses related to the sales and marketing of the company s products and services 
sales and marketing expenses increased from million fiscal to million in fiscal sales and marketing expenses decreased as a percentage of total revenues from in fiscal to in fiscal of the increase in sales and marketing expense in absolute dollars  million relates to additional marketing initiatives  approximately half of which relate to the recently acquired companies 
additionally  sales costs assumed as part of the company s acquisitions accounted for an additional million of sales and marketing expenses during fiscal consequently  sales expenses actually decreased by approximately million within the company s core business operations during fiscal  the majority of which relates to approximately  less of severance costs during fiscal compared to fiscal  when the company underwent an internal resizing program aimed at reducing costs throughout the organization 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consisted primarily of the salaries of administrative personnel and related overhead and facilities expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal but remained consistent as a percentage of total revenues at in both fiscal and of the million increase in general and administrative expenses  approximately half relates to the acquisitions  most notably centrinity 
the balance of the increase in general and administrative expenses relates to increases in a number of administrative areas  the majority of which were driven by a higher volume of business activity in fiscal as compared with fiscal depreciation expenses 
depreciation expense decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in depreciation expense is a result of the fact the company did not make significant capital expenditures in fiscal depreciation relating to the capital assets added as part of the fiscal acquisitions was only recorded for a partial year  and as a result this additional depreciation did not offset the reduction realized from the company s core base of capital assets during the year 
amortization of acquired intangible assets 
amortization of acquired intangible assets includes amortization of both acquired technology and customer assets 
additionally  during fiscal amortization of acquired intangible assets included amortization of goodwill on acquisitions 
at the beginning of fiscal  the company discontinued its amortization of goodwill consistent with new accounting pronouncements 
as a result  amortization of acquired intangible assets decreased from million for fiscal to million for fiscal this decrease was principally the result of the discontinued amortization of goodwill  which was partially offset by additional amortization on the intangible assets recorded as part of the fiscal acquisitions 
other income loss 
other income increased from million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal during fiscal  the gain of million related primarily to the company s attempted acquisition of accelio corporation  a software company located in ottawa  ontario 
the gain that the company realized on this attempted acquisition arose from the sale of shares of accelio common stock owned by the 
table of contents company and in connection with certain lock up agreements in connection with the attempted acquisition  partially offset by the costs incurred 
the million gain in fiscal is primarily comprised of foreign exchange gains realized during the year  the most significant cause of which was the appreciation of the euro against the us dollar 
interest 
interest income decreased from million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal the decrease was due to lower interest rates realized during fiscal as compared with fiscal income taxes 
during fiscal  the company recorded a tax provision of million compared to  during fiscal the increase in the company s tax provision is due to the fact that during fiscal  the company became taxable in certain taxing jurisdictions where it was previously able to use loss carryforwards 
the net deferred income tax asset as at june  of million arises from available income tax losses and future income tax deductions 
the company s ability to use these income tax losses and future income tax deductions is dependent upon the operations of the company in the tax jurisdictions in which such losses or deductions arose 
management records a valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets when management believes it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
based on the reversal of deferred income tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  the character of the income tax asset and tax planning strategies  management has determined that a valuation allowance of million is required in respect of its deferred income tax assets as at june  a valuation allowance of million was required for the deferred income tax assets as at june  in order to fully utilize the net deferred income tax assets of million  the company will need to generate aggregate future taxable income in applicable jurisdictions of approximately million 
based on the company s current projection of taxable income for the periods in which the deferred income tax assets are deductible  it is more likely than not that the company will realize the benefit of the net deferred income tax assets as at june  during fiscal  the company recorded deferred tax assets in connection with its acquisition of centrinity  corechange and eloquent 
specifically  the company recorded deferred tax assets of million  million  and million in respect of centrinity  corechange and eloquent  respectively 
fiscal compared with fiscal revenues 
total revenues included license and networking revenues  customer support revenues  and service revenues 
total revenues increased from million in the year ended june  to million in the year ended june  revenues from licenses and networking decreased from million in the year ended june  to million in the year ended june  the decrease in license and networking revenues was a result of the overall slowdown in information technology spending which was  in part  accelerated by the september th terrorist activities which then continued throughout fiscal though all aspects of the company s revenues were affected by this overall economic slowdown  revenues relating to the company s licenses were most strongly impacted 
it was the company s experience throughout most of fiscal that customers were more hesitant to commit to large  enterprise wide deployments of the company s software and as a result  the company experienced a lengthening of its sales cycles 
some potentially larger deals were replaced by smaller deals  while other large deals were simply deferred by customers 
several of these large deals were ultimately completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal  when certain customer opportunities that had been worked on throughout the year finally closed 
also during fiscal  the company began actively promoting the rental of livelink to customers through an asp model 
under this model  users are granted use of livelink on a secure  hosted third party server  for which they pay a monthly fee on a per user basis 
revenues earned from this service have been classified as networking revenues 
during fiscal  networking revenues totaled million  as compared with million in fiscal customer support revenues increased from million in the year ended june  to million in the year ended june  the increase in customer support revenues resulted from several factors 
the licenses granted throughout fiscal  as well as strong renewal rates for maintenance contracts for existing accounts  had a positive impact on customer support revenues 
also  in fiscal  the company completed a number of acquisitions during the middle of the year 
as a result  fiscal s customer support revenue includes only a partial year of revenues from these acquisitions  while fiscal contains a full year s customer support revenues for the acquired businesses 
the impact on fiscal customer service revenues of having a full year of revenue relating to these acquired businesses as opposed to a partial year in fiscal was approximately million 

table of contents service revenues increased from million in the year ended june  to million in the year ended june  the increase in service revenues was primarily attributable to an increase in consulting and integration services provided to new license customers

cost of license and networking revenues decreased from million in the year ended june  to million in the year ended june  as a percentage of license and networking revenues  the cost of license and networking revenues remained constant at for both fiscal and fiscal the decrease in cost of license and networking revenues in total dollars was partially due to a third party product cost of approximately  associated with a large license transaction that was recorded during fiscal typically  license transactions entered into by the company do not involve large amounts of third party product cost  thus this particular transaction caused an increase in cost of license and networking revenues in fiscal this decrease in cost of license and networking revenues from fiscal is also due to the fact that license revenue has decreased since the prior year 
the decrease in cost of license and networking revenues is generally consistent with the decrease in license revenue 
cost of networking revenues were  in fiscal compared with  in fiscal cost of customer support revenues is comprised primarily of technical support personnel and their related costs 
cost of customer support revenues increased from million in the year ended june  to million in the year ended june   mostly as a result of increased headcount costs in fiscal as compared with fiscal as a percentage of customer support revenues  customer support costs decreased from in the year ended june  to in the year ended june  this decrease as a percentage of customer support revenues resulted from certain cost reduction and efficiency measures that were taken during fiscal  which provided for the rationalization of certain roles within the company s support organization 
cost of service revenues consisted primarily of the costs of providing integration  customization and training 
cost of service revenues increased from million in the year ended june  to million in the year ended june  this slight increase is primarily due to some additional headcount costs incurred during fiscal to support the expanded activities of the integration and consulting departments

this was a result of the company entering into fewer subcontracting arrangements during fiscal  as well as using fewer consultants 
both of these initiatives were part of company wide cost containment measures regarding discretionary spending undertaken during the year 
this increase in labor costs was offset by lower spending on travel and training  as well as the recognition of investment tax credits recorded as a reduction to research and development expenses 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consisted primarily of compensation of sales and marketing personnel  as well as expenses associated with advertising  trade shows  facilities and other expenses related to the sales and marketing of the company s products and services

table of contents ended june  to in the year ended june  although the total dollars spent on sales and marketing activities were about the same in both fiscal and fiscal  the allocation of those costs varied slightly between years 
in fiscal  the company experienced a slight increase in labor costs  mostly attributable to annual remuneration increases for the company s sales and marketing personnel 
this increase though  was more than offset by decreases in a number of discretionary areas  specifically recruiting costs  consulting expenses  and external marketing spending 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consisted primarily of the salaries of administrative personnel and related overhead and facilities expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased from million in the year ended june  to million in the year ended june  and decreased as a percentage of total revenues from in the year ended june  to in the year ended june  during fiscal  the company initiated a series of cost reduction measures affecting a number of discretionary and controllable areas 
specifically  the company realized cost savings with respect to travel  consulting  and legal expenses that totaled approximately million during fiscal as compared with fiscal depreciation expenses 
depreciation expense increased from million in the year ended june  to million in the year ended june  this increase was the result of new capital expenditures during fiscal as well as a full year s depreciation on assets purchased or acquired in fiscal amortization of acquired intangible assets

the company s revenues for the quarter ended september of each fiscal year generally have been lower than revenues for other quarters  however  it is uncertain whether this trend will continue in current or future periods 
due to all of the foregoing factors  the company s operating results in a particular quarter may fail to meet market expectations  which could result in a decrease in the price of common shares and a loss to shareholders 
liquidity and capital resources other than the cash generated through its operations  the company has traditionally financed its cash needs primarily through the issuance of the company s common shares and special warrants 
at june   the company had working capital of million compared to working capital of million at june  this decrease in working capital was primarily as a result of cash used to purchase the acquired companies and to 
table of contents repurchase the company s common stock  offset partially by fiscal net income 
cash and cash equivalents increased from million at june  to million at june   primarily for the same reasons including changes in the components of working capital 
the company has a cdn million usd million line of credit with a canadian chartered bank  under which no borrowings were outstanding at june   the entire amount of which was available for use 
the line of credit bears interest at the lender s prime rate plus 
the company has pledged all of its assets including an assignment of accounts receivable as collateral for outstanding amounts under this line of credit 
on november   the company completed the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of centrinity for cash consideration of million 
the results of operations of centrinity have been consolidated with those of open text beginning november  on february   open text inc oti  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of corechange 
consideration for this acquisition is comprised of i cash consideration of million paid on closing  ii additional cash consideration of  to be held in escrow in order to satisfy potential breaches of representations and warranties as provided for in the share purchase agreement  and iii additional cash consideration to be earned over the one year period following closing  contingent on corechange meeting certain revenue targets 
the results of operations of corechange have been consolidated with those of open text beginning february  on march   open text completed an acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of eloquent for cash consideration of million  of which million will be held in escrow to secure certain representations  warranties and covenants of eloquent in the acquisition agreement 
the results of operations of eloquent have been consolidated with those of open text beginning march  cash provided by operations during fiscal was million  compared to million for fiscal this increase is due to higher net income during fiscal  as well as cash generated from a number of working capital accounts 
net cash used in investment activities was million of which million relates to the acquisitions of centrinity  corechange and eloquent 
the other significant investment activity during fiscal was the purchase of capital assets  which totaled million 
net cash used in investment activities was  for fiscal  consisting primarily of acquisitions of furniture and equipment totaling million  offset by proceeds on the sale of other investments of million 
net cash used in financing activities was million during fiscal this amount was comprised of proceeds of million received by the company related to the exercise of stock options and the purchases made under the employee stock purchase plan  offset by million spent on repurchasing  common shares of which million has been charged to share capital and million has been charged to accumulated deficit 
net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal  primarily resulting from the repurchase of  common shares on the open market at a cost of million  of which million has been charged to share capital and million has been charged to accumulated deficit  partially offset by proceeds of million from the sale of common shares related to the exercise of company stock options and the employee stock purchase plan 
the company earns interest on its cash and cash equivalents  which consist of highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less at the date of acquisition 
interest earned from these investments totaled million during fiscal and million during fiscal  due to lower interest rates in fiscal as compared to fiscal the company s capital asset balance increased from million as at june  to million as at june  this increase is primarily due to the addition of capital assets acquired through the company s three acquisitions completed during fiscal that totaled over million and regular acquisitions totaling million as well the impact of foreign exchange revaluations 

table of contents the increase in the company s goodwill from million as at june  to million as at june  is due to additional goodwill recorded in connection with the fiscal acquisitions see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s other assets totaled million as at june  as compared to million as at june  other assets are primarily comprised of specifically identifiable intangible assets acquired through previous acquisitions 
during fiscal  the company added million of intangible assets as a result of the acquisitions 
these assets  along with the company s other specifically identifiable intangible assets  are being amortized over varying periods generally ranging from four to seven years 
the company currently anticipates that its operating expenses for the year ending june  will be relatively consistent  as a percentage of revenue  with those incurred in fiscal similarly  the company currently anticipates that amounts expended on capital assets for the year ending june  will be generally consistent with those incurred during fiscal these expectations  however  are subject to change based on a number of factors  including the possibility of completing acquisitions and other strategic transactions 
the company anticipates that its cash and cash equivalents and available credit facilities will be sufficient to fund its anticipated cash requirements for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
the company may need to raise additional funds  however  in order to fund more rapid expansion of its business  develop new and enhance existing products and services  or acquire complementary products  businesses or technologies 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of the company s shareholders may be reduced  the company s shareholders may experience additional dilution  and such securities may have rights  preferences  and privileges senior to those of the company s current shareholders 
additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to the company  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  the company s ability to fund its expansion  take advantage of unanticipated opportunities or develop or enhance the company s services or products would be significantly limited 
commitments and contractual obligations as of june   the company had future commitments and contractual obligations as summarized in the following table in millions 
these commitments are principally comprised of operating leases for the company s leased premises 
fiscal year thereafter the company does not enter into off balance sheet financing as a matter of practice except for the use of operating leases for office space  computer equipment  and vehicles 
in accordance with gaap  neither the lease liability nor the underlying asset is carried on the balance sheet  as the terms of the leases do not meet the criteria for capitalization 
the company typically agrees in its sales contracts to indemnify its customers for any expenses or liability resulting from claimed infringements of patents  trademarks or copyrights of third parties 
the terms of these indemnification agreements are generally perpetual any time after execution of the agreement 
the maximum amount of potential future indemnification is unlimited 
to date the company has not paid any amounts to settle claims or defend lawsuits 

table of contents cautionary statements certain statements in this annual report on form k constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors  including those set forth in the following cautionary statements and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  that may cause the actual results  performance or achievements of the company  or developments in the company s industry  to differ materially from the anticipated results  performance  achievements or developments expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
the following factors  as well as all of the other information set forth herein  should be considered carefully in evaluating open text and its business 
if any of the following risks were to occur  the company s business  financial condition and results of operations would likely suffer 
in that event  the trading price of the company s common shares would likely decline 
if the company does not continue to develop new technologically advanced products  future revenues will be negatively affected open text s success will depend on its ability to design  develop  test  market  license and support new software products and enhancements of current products on a timely basis in response to both competitive products and evolving demands of the marketplace 
in addition  new software products and enhancements must remain compatible with standard platforms and file formats 
presently  open text is continuing to enhance the capability of its livelink software to enable users to form workgroups and collaborate on intranets and the internet 
the company increasingly must integrate software licensed from third parties with its own software to create or improve intranet and internet products 
these products are key to the success of the company s strategy  and the company may not be successful in developing and marketing these and other new software products and enhancements 
if the company is unable to successfully integrate the technologies licensed from third parties  to develop new software products and enhancements to existing products  or to complete products currently under development  or if such integrated or new products or enhancements do not achieve market acceptance  the company s operating results will materially suffer 
in addition  if new industry standards emerge that the company does not anticipate or adapt to  the company s software products could be rendered obsolete and its business would be materially harmed 
if the company s products and services do not gain market acceptance  the company may not be able to increase its revenues open text is continually working on the development of  and improvements to  new versions of livelink and other products 
in june the company released livelink launchforce an application that offers closed loop distribution of critical information to a distributed field sales organization 
this product based on rich media technology acquired by open text from eloquent  significantly speeds up training for sales forces and simultaneously helps large sales organizations save money 
in august the company released livelink that significantly advances the ease of use of the system and added significant capabilities to support team collaboration 
in addition the company continues to improve meeting zone based on customer feedback 
the primary market for open text s software and services is rapidly evolving 
as is typical in the case of a new and rapidly evolving industry  demand for and market acceptance of products and services that have been released recently or that are planned for future release are subject to a high level of uncertainty 
if the markets for the company s products and services fail to develop  develop more slowly than expected or become saturated with competitors  the company s business will suffer 
the company may be unable to successfully market its current products and services  develop new software products  services and enhancements to current products and services  complete customer installations on a timely basis  or complete products and services currently under development 
if the company s products and services or enhancements do not achieve and sustain market acceptance  the company s business and operating results will be materially harmed 

table of contents current and future competitors could have a significant impact on the company s ability to generate future revenue and profits the markets for the company s products are new  intensely competitive  subject to rapid technological change and are evolving rapidly 
the company expects competition to increase and intensify in the future as the markets for the company s products continue to develop and as additional companies enter each of its markets 
numerous releases of products and services that compete with those of the company can be expected in the near future 
the company may not be able to compete effectively with current and future competitors 
if competitors were to engage in aggressive pricing policies with respect to competing products  or significant price competition were to otherwise develop  the company would likely be forced to lower its prices 
this could result in lower revenues  reduced margins  loss of customers  or loss of market share for the company 
acquisitions  investments  joint ventures and other business initiatives may negatively affect our operating results open text acquired three companies in fiscal and continues to seek out opportunities to acquire or invest in businesses  products and technologies that expand  complement or are otherwise related to the company s current business or products 
the company also considers from time to time  opportunities to engage in joint ventures or other business collaborations with third parties to address particular market segments 
these activities  including the fiscal acquisitions  create risks such as the need to integrate and manage the businesses acquired with the business of the company  additional demands on the company s management  resources  systems  procedures and controls  disruption of the company s ongoing business  and diversion of management s attention from other business concerns 
moreover  these transactions could involve substantial investment of funds and or technology transfers and the acquisition or disposition of product lines or businesses 
also  such activities could result in one times charges and expenses and have the potential to either dilute existing shareholders or result in the assumption of debt 
such acquisitions  investments  joint ventures or other business collaborations may involve significant commitments of financial and other resources of the company 
any such activity may not be successful in generating revenue  income or other returns to the company  and the financial or other resources committed to such activities will not be available to the company for other purposes 
the company s inability to address these risks could negatively affect the company s operating results 
a reduction in the number or sales efforts by distributors could materially impact the company s revenues a portion of the company s revenue is derived from the license of its products through third parties 
the company s success will depend  in part  upon its ability to maintain access to existing channels of distribution and to gain access to new channels if and when they develop 
the company may not be able to retain a sufficient number of its existing or future distributors 
distributors may also give higher priority to the sale of other products which could include products of competitors or may not devote sufficient resources to marketing the company s products 
the performance of third party distributors is largely outside the control of the company and the company is unable to predict the extent to which these distributors will be successful in marketing and licensing the company s products 
a reduction in sales efforts  or a decline in the number of distributors  or the discontinuance of sales of the company s products by its distributors could lead to reduced revenue 
the company s international operations expose the company to business risks that could cause the company s operating results to suffer open text intends to continue to make efforts to increase its international operations and anticipates that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of its revenue 
revenues derived outside of north america represented  and of total revenues for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal respectively 
these international operations are subject to certain risks and costs  including the difficulty and expense of administering business abroad  compliance with foreign laws  compliance with domestic and international import and export laws and regulations  costs related to localizing products for foreign markets  and costs related to translating and distributing products in a timely manner 
international operations also tend to expose the company to a longer sales and collection cycle  as well as potential losses arising from currency fluctuations  and limitations regarding the repatriation of earnings 
significant international sales may also expose the company to greater risk from political and economic instability  unexpected changes in canadian  us or other governmental policies concerning import and export of goods and technology  and other regulatory requirements and tariffs and other trade barriers 
in addition  international earnings may be subject to taxation by more than one jurisdiction  which could also materially adversely affect the company s results of operations 
moreover  international 
table of contents expansion may be more difficult  time consuming  and costly 
as a result  if revenues from international operations do not offset the expenses of establishing and maintaining foreign operations  the company s operating results will suffer 
the company s products may contain defects that could harm the company s reputation  be costly to correct  delay revenues  and expose the company to litigation the company s products are highly complex and sophisticated and  from time to time  may contain design defects or software errors that are difficult to detect and correct 
errors may be found in new software products or improvements to existing products after commencement of commercial shipments  or  if discovered  the company may not be able to successfully correct such errors in a timely manner  or at all 
in addition  despite tests carried out by the company on all its products  the company may not be able to fully simulate the environment in which its products will operate and  as a result  the company may be unable to adequately detect design defects or software errors inherent in its products and which only become apparent when the products are installed in an end user s network 
the occurrence of errors and failures in the company s products could result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of the company s products  and alleviating such errors and failures in the company s products could require significant expenditure of capital and other resources by the company 
because the company s end user base consists of a limited number of end users  the harm to the company s reputation resulting from product errors and failures would be damaging to the company 
the company regularly provides a warranty with its products and the financial impact of these warranty obligations may be significant in the future 
the company s agreements with its strategic partners and end users typically contain provisions designed to limit the company s exposure to claims  such as exclusions of all implied warranties and limitations on damage remedies and the availability of consequential or incidental damages 
however  such provisions may not effectively protect the company against claims and related liabilities and costs 
although the company maintains errors and omissions insurance coverage and comprehensive liability insurance coverage  such coverage may not be adequate and all claims may not be covered 
accordingly  any such claim could negatively affect the company s financial condition 
other companies may claim that the company s intellectual property violates their patents  which could result in significant costs to defend and if the company is not successful could have a significant impact on the company s ability to generate future revenue and profits although the company does not currently believe that it is infringing on the intellectual property of other companies  as software patents become more prevalent  it is possible that certain parties will claim that the company s products violate their patents 
such claims could be disruptive to the company s ability to generate revenue and may result in significantly increased costs as the company attempts to license the patents or rework its products to ensure that they are not in violation of the claimant s patents or dispute the claims 
the company currently depends on certain third party software  the loss of which could result in increased costs of  or delays in  licenses of the company s products for a limited number of product modules  the company relies on certain software that it licenses from third parties  including software that is integrated with internally developed software and which is used in its products to perform key functions 
these third party software licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  and the related software may not continue to be appropriately supported  maintained  or enhanced by the licensors 
the loss of license to use  or the inability of licensors to support  maintain  and enhance any of such software  could result in increased costs  delays  or reductions in product shipments until equivalent software is developed or licensed  if at all  and integrated 
current and future competitors could have a significant impact on the company s ability to generate future revenue and profits the markets for the company s products are new  intensely competitive  subject to rapid technological change and are evolving rapidly 
the company expects competition to increase and intensify in the future as the markets for the company s products continue to develop and as additional companies enter each of its markets 
numerous releases of products and services that compete with those of the company can be expected in the near future 
the company may not be able to compete effectively with current and future competitors 
if competitors 
table of contents were to engage in aggressive pricing policies with respect to competing products  or significant price competition were to otherwise develop  the company would likely be forced to lower its prices 
this could result in lower revenues  reduced margins  loss of customers  or loss of market share for the company 
the length of the company s sales cycle can fluctuate significantly which could result in significant fluctuations in license revenue being recognized from quarter to quarter because the decision by a customer to purchase the company s products often involves relatively large scale implementation across the customer s network or networks  licenses of these products may entail a significant commitment of resources by prospective customers  accompanied by the attendant risks and delays frequently associated with significant expenditures and lengthy sales cycle and implementation procedures 
given the significant investment and commitment of resources required by an organization in order to implement the company s software  the company s sales cycle tends to take considerable time to complete 
particularly in the current economic environment of reduced information technology spending  it can take several months  or even quarters  for sales opportunities to translate into revenue 
if installation of the company s products in one or more customers takes longer than originally anticipated  the date on which revenue from these licenses could be recognized would be delayed 
such delays could cause the company s revenues to be lower than expected in a particular period 
the company may not achieve its anticipated revenues if it does not expand its product line substantially all of open text s revenues are currently derived from its livelink and related products and services offered by the company in the internet  intranet and extranet markets 
accordingly  the company s future results of operations will depend  in part  on expanding its product line and related services 
to achieve its revenue goals  the company must also continue to enhance these products and services to meet the evolving needs of its customers 
a reduction in demand or increase in competition in the market for internet or intranet applications  or a decline in licenses of livelink and related services  would significantly harm the company s business 
the company must continue to manage its growth or its operating results could be adversely affected over the past several years  open text has experienced growth in revenues  operating expenses  and product distribution channels 
in addition  open text s markets have continued to evolve at a rapid pace 
the total number of employees of the company has grown from as of september  to  excluding contractors  as of june  the company believes that continued growth in the breadth of its product lines and services and in the number of personnel will be required in order to establish and maintain the company s competitive position 
moreover  the company has grown significantly through acquisitions in the past and continues to review acquisition opportunities as a means of increasing the size and scope of its business 
open text s growth  coupled with the rapid evolution of the company s markets  has placed  and is likely to continue to place  significant strains on its administrative and operational resources and increased demands on its internal systems  procedures and controls 
the company s administrative infrastructure  systems  procedures and controls may not adequately support the company s operations and the company s management may not be able to achieve the rapid  effective execution of the product and business initiatives necessary to successfully penetrate the markets for the company s products and services and to successfully integrate any business acquisitions in the future 
if the company is unable to manage growth effectively  the company s operating results will likely suffer 
the company s products rely on the stability of various infrastructure software which  if not stable  could negatively impact the effectiveness of the company s products  resulting in harm to the reputation and business of the company developments of internet and intranet applications by open text depends on the stability  functionality and scalability of the infrastructure software of the underlying intranet  such as that of sun  hp  oracle  microsoft and others 
if weaknesses in such infrastructure software exist  the company may not be able to correct or compensate for such weaknesses 
if the company is unable to address weaknesses resulting from problems in the infrastructure software such that the company s products do not meet customer needs or expectations  the company s business and reputation may be significantly harmed 

table of contents the company s quarterly revenues and operating results are likely to fluctuate which could impact the price of the company s common shares the company has experienced  and is likely to continue to experience  significant fluctuations in quarterly revenues and operating results caused by many factors  including changes in the demand for the company s products  the introduction or enhancement of products by the company and its competitors  market acceptance of enhancements or products  delays in the introduction of products or enhancements by the company or its competitors  customer order deferrals in anticipation of upgrades and new products  changes in the company s pricing policies or those of its competitors  delays involved in installing products with customers  the mix of distribution channels through which products are licensed  the mix of products and services sold  the mix of international and north american revenues  foreign currency exchange rates and general economic conditions 
like many other software companies  the company has generally recognized a substantial portion of its revenues in the last weeks of each quarter 
accordingly  the cancellation or deferrals of even a small number of licenses or delays in installations of the company s products could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations in any particular quarter 
the company also has noted historically lower sales in july and august than in other months  which has resulted in proportionately lower revenues recorded in the quarter ended september than in other quarters 
because of the impact of the timing of product introductions and the rapid evolution of the company s business and the markets it serves  the company cannot predict whether seasonal patterns experienced in the past will continue 
for these reasons  no one should rely on period to period comparisons of the company s financial results to forecast future performance 
it is likely that the company s quarterly revenue and operating results will vary significantly in the future and if a shortfall in revenue occurs or if operating costs increase significantly  the market price of our common shares could decline 
failure to protect our intellectual property could harm our ability to compete effectively the company is highly dependent on its ability to protect its proprietary technology 
the company s efforts to protect its intellectual property rights may not be successful 
the company relies on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  non disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions to establish and maintain its proprietary rights 
the company has not sought patent protection for its products 
while us and canadian copyright laws  international conventions and international treaties may provide meaningful protection against unauthorized duplication of software  the laws of some foreign jurisdictions may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of canada or the united states 
software piracy has been  and can be expected to be  a persistent problem for the software industry 
enforcement of the company s intellectual property rights may be difficult  particularly in some nations outside of the united states and canada in which the company seeks to market its products 
despite the precautions taken by the company  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties  including competitors  to copy certain portions of the company s products or to reverse engineer or obtain and use information that the company regards as proprietary 
although the company does not believe that its products infringe on the rights of third parties  third parties may assert infringement claims against the company in the future  and any such assertions may result in costly litigation or require the company to obtain a license for the intellectual property rights of third parties  such licenses may not be available on reasonable terms  or at all 
if the company is not able to attract and retain top employees  the company s ability to compete may be harmed the company s performance is substantially dependent on the performance of its executive officers and key employees 
the loss of the services of any of its executive officers or other key employees could significantly harm the company s business 
the company does not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of its employees 
the company s success is also highly dependent on its continuing ability to identify  hire  train  retain and motivate highly qualified management  technical  sales and marketing personnel  including recently hired officers and other employees 
specifically  the recruitment of top research developers  along with experienced salespeople  remains critical to the company s success 
competition for such personnel is intense  and the company may not be able to attract  integrate or retain highly qualified technical and managerial personnel in the future 

table of contents the volatility of the company s stock price could lead to losses by shareholders the market price of the common shares has been highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations 
such fluctuations in market price may continue in response to quarterly variations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products by the company or its competitors  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or other events or factors 
in addition  the financial markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of equity securities of many high technology companies and that often have been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies or have resulted from the failure of the operating results of such companies to meet market expectations in a particular quarter 
broad market fluctuations or any failure of the company s operating results in a particular quarter to meet market expectations may adversely affect the market price of the common shares  resulting in losses to shareholders 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against such a company 
due to the volatility of our stock price  the company could be the target of securities litigation in the future 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is primarily exposed to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risks the company s exposure to interest rate fluctuations relates primarily to its investment portfolio  since the company had no borrowings outstanding under its line of credit at june  the company primarily invests its cash in short term high quality securities with reputable financial institutions 
the primary objective of the company s investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income the company receives from its investments without significantly increasing risk 
the company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
the interest income from the company s investments is subject to interest rate fluctuations  which the company believes would not have a material impact on the financial position of the company 
all highly liquid investments with a maturity of less than three months at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents 
all investments with maturities of three months or greater are classified as available for sale and considered to be short term investments 
some of the securities that the company has invested in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in the prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
the impact on net interest income of a basis point adverse change in interest rates for the fiscal year ended june  would have been a decrease of approximately million 
foreign currency risk the company has net monetary asset and liability balances in foreign currencies other than the us dollar  including the canadian dollar cdn  the pound sterling gbp  the australian dollar aud  the swiss franc chf  the german mark dem  the french franc frf  the dutch guilder nlg  the danish kroner dkk  the arabian durham aed  and the euro eur 
the company s cash and cash equivalents are primarily held in us dollars 
the company s net income is affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar as compared to foreign currencies as a result of transactions in foreign markets 
approximately   and of the company s total revenues in fiscal   and  respectively  were derived from operations outside of north america 
approximately   and of the company s operating expenses in fiscal  and  respectively  were incurred from operations outside of north america 
the company does not currently use
