given these risks and uncertainties  investors should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements as a prediction of actual results 
critical accounting estimates the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements  therefore we consider these to be our critical accounting estimates 
the most significant estimates included in these financial statements include valuation allowances and reserves for accounts receivable  inventory and income taxes 
these areas are subject to the risks and uncertainties described above 
actual results  therefore  could differ from those estimates 

table of contents revenue recognition and consideration to resellers revenues consist of sales to customers and royalty income 
wholesale revenues are recognized when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer  based on the shipping terms 
retail store revenues are recognized at the time of sale 
royalty income which accounted for approximately million  million and million in fiscal years  and  respectively  is recognized when earned 
we engage in buy down programs with certain retailers  principally in the form of product markdown allowances for obsolete and slow moving products that are in the retailer s inventory 
the buy down programs are accounted for as a reduction in revenues 
our procedure for determining product markdown allowances is to monitor sell through data and make provisions for markdowns as it becomes apparent that they will be required to sell the product through 
markdowns are negotiated with retailers and changes are made to our estimates as agreements are reached 
actual amounts for markdowns have not differed materially from estimates 
cooperative advertising funds are available to all retailers in good standing 
for retailers to receive reimbursement under such program the retailer must meet the proper advertising guidelines and trademark requirements 
the company complies with eitf and accounts for these co op advertising programs as operating expenses 
our accounting policy is to accrue for co op advertising expenses on the basis of sales to qualifying customers 
reserve for uncollectable accounts receivable we make ongoing estimates relating to the collectability of our accounts receivable and maintain a reserve for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if actual losses differ from estimated losses there will be an effect on net income and liquidity 
in determining the amount of the reserve  we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based upon ongoing credit evaluations 
these evaluations  which are performed by our corporate credit department  include  but are not limited to  analyzing our customer s financial statements  maintaining a credit watch list to monitor accounts receivable exposure and reviewing the customer s prior payment history 
we predominantly sell our products to large retailers 
historically  we have not experienced significant losses related to trade receivables 
however  there is a risk that some of these retail customers could experience financial difficulties  particularly in a weak economy  that may cause them to extend payment times or to default on their obligations to us 
if a large customer were to default on its financial obligations to us  we could experience a decrease in liquidity 
we believe  however  that we have sufficient financial resources to mitigate the effect that a large default would have on our ability to continue to operate our business 
in addition to the impact on liquidity  we could also experience a decrease in future revenues and operating margins related to this loss of business 
inventory reserves the fashion oriented nature of our business  along with the potential for changes in customer preferences and the extended product development lead times  leave us vulnerable to the risk of inventory obsolescence both at our own stores and also to our wholesale inventories 
we are also exposed to the risk of inventory markdowns for excess or obsolete products  both at stride rite owned retail stores and from independent retailers 
we perform regular detailed product sell through analysis to determine excess and close out inventory and make provisions for markdowns as they become known 
this analysis is also used to assist in determining our ability to sell inventory through different channels and to estimate future selling prices 
our provisions for markdowns have been adequate in the past and have not fluctuated significantly 
we regularly review our provisions for obsolete inventory 
we have continually managed these risks in the past and believe we can successfully manage them in the future 
however  our revenues and operating margins may suffer if we are unable to effectively manage these risks 
taxes we record income tax liabilities utilizing known obligations and estimates of potential obligations 
a deferred tax asset or liability is recognized whenever there are future tax effects from existing temporary 
table of contents differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we must make estimates and judgments on future taxable income  considering feasible tax planning strategies and taking into account existing facts and circumstances  to determine if a valuation allowance is necessary 
a valuation allowance has not been assigned to our deferred tax assets since we believe it is more likely than not that we will fully realize the benefits of such tax assets 
when we determine that deferred tax assets could be realized in greater or lesser amounts than recorded  the asset balance and income statement reflects the change in the period such determination is made 
due to changes in facts and circumstances and the estimates and judgments that are involved in determining the proper valuation allowance  differences between actual future events and prior estimates and judgments could result in adjustments to a future valuation allowance 
we use an estimate of our annual effective tax rate at each interim period based on the facts and circumstances known at that time  while the actual effective tax rate is calculated at year end 
this estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year 
when this occurs  we adjust the income tax provision during the period in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year to date provision equals the expected annual rate 
the preparation of federal and state tax returns requires interpretations  judgments and estimates which are subject to the review and audit of taxing authorities 
we believe that the results of audits will not materially change tax filings or adversely affect earnings 
contingencies the sale of tommy hilfiger branded footwear is a significant portion of our business 
the tommy hilfiger footwear sales are contingent on our licensing agreement with tommy hilfiger licensing  inc during fiscal  we renewed the agreement for an additional three year term  which expires in march whether our license with tommy hilfiger will remain in effect depends on our achieving certain minimum sales levels for the licensed products 
we expect to continue to meet the minimum sales levels required by the tommy hilfiger license agreement 
we believe that no provision is currently required for costs related to the potential loss of this license 
if we lose the tommy hilfiger license  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
results of operations percent change increase decrease vs 
vs 
net sales gross profit selling and administrative expenses operating income income before income taxes net income percent to net sales gross profit selling and administrative expenses nonrecurring charges income operating income income before income taxes net income fiscal compared to fiscal net sales during fiscal  consolidated net sales increased million to million  or above the sales level achieved in fiscal this increase was somewhat attributable to the company s sales performance 
table of contents during the fourth quarter  which was up versus the fourth quarter of fiscal performance comparatives of fiscal to fiscal after the third quarter of fiscal were affected by the general business slowdown occurring since the post time period 
during fiscal the overall business climate remained difficult 
it is currently not certain whether this challenging retail environment will improve during fiscal if this trend continues and the economy remains weak  it may negatively affect net sales in fiscal unit shipments of current line merchandise during fiscal for the company s wholesale brands were below the prior year 
the average wholesale selling price declined from fiscal first quality wholesale gross sales decreased by million  or below the wholesale gross sales level achieved in fiscal the company also recorded a million reduction in the sale of closeout items versus the prior year 
partially offsetting these decreases was a million increase in the sale of promotional products compared to the fiscal year 
the increased sale of promotional products was a major reason for the sales increase for the fiscal year versus the prior year 
retail store sales increased million  or versus the sales levels recorded in fiscal higher sales allowances reduced gross sales by million versus the fiscal year 
this was partially offset by lower returns which decreased million as compared to fiscal royalty income increased by million in fiscal as compared to the amount recorded in fiscal sales of the stride rite children s group were million  higher than fiscal  with an sales increase at children s group s retail stores offsetting an decrease in sales to independent retailers 
sales at comparable children s group retail stores stores open for weeks in each fiscal year decreased for the fiscal year  following a increase in fiscal although the children s group s store count increased by only from the prior fiscal year  versus  there were a significant number of stores that were either opened or closed during fiscal the children s group opened a total of retail stores during the fiscal year 
the children s group closed under performing retail stores along with successfully exiting from the federated children s leased department stores 
sales at stores newly opened during fiscal were sufficient to offset the sales declines that resulted from the exit of the federated children s leased department stores 
approximately of the children s group s stores were newly opened during fiscal the rate of new store openings will slow significantly during fiscal because the children s group will be focusing its efforts on integrating the operations and merchandising of the new stores and improving the overall retail store s financial performance 
current plans call for the addition of less than ten new stores during the fiscal year 
sales of keds branded products were million  a decrease of in fiscal as compared to the prior fiscal year 
the sales decrease was principally the result of weaknesses in the women s basics product lines 
during fiscal several women s basic programs were transitioned to new product offerings 
these transitions were not successfully received in the market and consequently they were not able to duplicate the performance realized in fiscal these declines were partially offset by both sales of pro keds products  which were new for fiscal and the increased sale of promotional products 
during fiscal the design and marketing of the pro keds product line will be transferred under the tommy hilfiger footwear unit to better match the customer profile for the development and marketing effort for the brand 
keds also opened one additional retail store in fiscal bringing the store count to six 
these stores are not expected to add significant sales volume to keds during fiscal sales of tommy hilfiger footwear products were million  an increase of in fiscal year as compared to fiscal the major factors contributing to this sales increase were the expansion of distribution to independents and shoe chain accounts as well as the production of special shoes for key accounts 
this has lessened the tommy hilfiger footwear unit s dependence on the department store sector  which has been experiencing a general weakness 
beginning with fiscal  the hilfiger children s product line has been transitioned to the stride rite children s group 
sales of sperry top sider products were million  an increase of in fiscal as compared to the prior fiscal year 
the improvement in sperry sales is primarily attributable to promotional items  increases in the sale of women s products and fewer returns 

table of contents sales of the stride rite international division were million  a gain of in fiscal as compared to the prior fiscal year principally due to increased sales of tommy hilfiger products 
gross profit in fiscal year our gross profit of million increased million or above fiscal our gross profit rate improved percentage points to as compared to the rate achieved in fiscal included in the fiscal cost of sales was a reversal of million of the prior fiscal year s million charge associated with the write down of inventory caused by the exit of the leased department store business 
additional discussion regarding this write down of inventory can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
excluding this million charge in fiscal and the subsequent reversal of million of it in fiscal  the gross profit rates for fiscal years and would have been and  respectively 
negatively affecting the comparison of the fiscal year s gross profit to the fiscal year amount was million due to reduced first quality wholesale product sales and million from increased sales allowances 
gross profit was also adversely affected by the west coast port s labor dispute  as approximately million in additional costs were spent in order to expedite the receipt of inventory 
offsetting these amounts was the increase in retail sales which added million to gross profit comparisons of fiscal versus also contributing to the improvement of the gross profit comparisons was the performance of promotional and closeout items which added approximately million to gross profit in fiscal year  versus restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company completed the prior year restructuring and recorded income of  less than per share after tax related to the reversal of unused prior year restructuring accruals 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded pre tax restructuring charges of  
per share after tax related to a restructuring of its administrative staff  the closing of the wilmington  massachusetts returns and product sample facility  the exit of the federated leased department store business and retail system asset impairment costs 
the fiscal restructuring included streamlining certain corporate and divisional operations reducing the administrative workforce by approximately or positions 
cash payments and other non cash items for the restructuring included  related to severance payments and other employee benefit costs   related to the consolidation of the wilmington  massachusetts returns and product sample facility into the huntington  indiana distribution center and  of other costs associated with the restructuring 
the fiscal restructuring charges also included asset writedown expenses associated with exiting the federated leased department store business which resulted in a write down of leaseholds and other assets of  and the impairment cost associated with the existing retail system totaling  during fiscal  the company charged  of costs to the fiscal restructuring accrual balance 
included in fiscal cost of sales is a reversal of million of the prior year s million charge associated with the write down of inventory caused by the exit of the federated leased department store business 
the following table summarizes the accrued costs associated with the fiscal restructuring actions by type and related activity through november  in thousands accrued severance and other employee related costs accrued facility closing costs asset writedowns accrued other costs total restructuring charges fiscal cash payments balance november  cash payments non cash items reversals and other adjustments balance november  
table of contents operating costs selling and administrative expenses excluding restructuring charges in fiscal decreased million to million or below the expense level incurred in fiscal as a percent of sales  selling and administrative costs were in fiscal compared to in fiscal included in expenses for fiscal were executive termination costs of million 
excluding these executive termination costs from the year to year comparisons  selling and administrative costs would have increased by million as compared to the prior year 
pension expense added million to operating costs as compared to fiscal pension expense is expected to increase by approximately an additional million in fiscal retail store expenses increased in fiscal as compared to the prior fiscal year 
the addition of new children s group retail stores during fiscal resulted in higher costs due to start up requirements for these new stores 
the disproportionate level of start up costs more than offset the cost savings that resulted from the exit of the federated leased department stores during the second quarter of fiscal current plans call for the addition of less than new stores in fiscal offsetting a portion of the increased retail store expenses were reductions that resulted from the restructuring that was initiated in the fourth quarter of fiscal and advertising expenses which decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal during fiscal advertising costs were of net sales versus of net sales in fiscal most of this decline was attributable to reductions in keds advertising  the result of transitioning the product line 
other income and taxes non operating income expense increased our pre tax earnings by million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal investment income decreased by million in fiscal  the result of both lower interest rates and lower average investments 
interest expense in fiscal decreased from fiscal  million because of both lower average borrowing levels and lower average interest rates 
in fiscal  the provision for income taxes increased million due to an increase in pre tax income combined with a higher effective tax rate 
our effective income tax rate was in fiscal and in fiscal the higher tax rate in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due principally to an increase in the need for certain state income tax accruals that were not necessary in the prior year 
our effective tax rates in and were reduced as compared to fiscal because of tax accruals previously established  which were no longer required 
the effective income tax rate is expected to increase in fiscal as we anticipate no further significant reductions in the prior year s tax accruals 
net income we earned million in fiscal  million or above fiscal s net income amount 
after excluding last year s after tax non recurring charges from the fiscal net income amount  the increase in net income for fiscal year would have been million or 
the higher earnings in fiscal resulted from higher net sales  an increased gross profit percent  lower operating expenses and non recurring charges somewhat offset by a higher income tax rate 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales during fiscal  consolidated net sales decreased million to million  or below the sales level achieved in fiscal a significant portion of this shortfall from fiscal occurred in the second half of the year as the economy weakened 
many retail customers  concerned over the health of the economy  responded by tightly managing their inventory levels resulting in an adverse effect on reorders 
sales of stride rite s branded wholesale operations decreased in fiscal unit shipments of current line merchandise during fiscal for stride rite s wholesale brands were below the prior year  while average selling prices declined from sales of discontinued products were higher than last year 

table of contents sales of the stride rite children s group were higher than fiscal  with a sales increase at stride rite children s retail stores somewhat offset by a decrease in sales to independent dealers  family shoe stores and department stores 
sales at comparable stores open for weeks in each fiscal year stride rite stores increased during fiscal  following a comparable store sales increase in fiscal stride rite children s group opened retail stores in fiscal and closed underperforming stores during the year to leave the year end store count at stores  up from the stores that were open as of december  keds recorded an sales decline in fiscal as compared to fiscal sales of the women s champion  although ahead of last year  were not sufficient to offset the declines in the other women s and children s products  down and  respectively 
the decline in other women s products was due to a decrease in the keds stretch product line and the lower overall sales performance of the keds fall seasonal products 
we opened five keds retail stores in fiscal to evaluate the direct to consumer distribution alternative for existing and new keds products 
the general weakness in the department store sector had a significantly negative impact on the sales of both tommy hilfiger and sperry products  due to their reliance on this channel for a significant portion of their sales 
sales of tommy hilfiger footwear products decreased as compared to the same period in fiscal sales of the sperry top sider brand decreased from fiscal international division revenues in fiscal were higher than fiscal  due to a launch of the keds brand in mexico  increases in tommy hilfiger sales in south america and increased royalty income from israel  all of which were somewhat offset by weak canadian sales compared to the fiscal year 
gross profit in fiscal  our gross profit of million decreased million or below fiscal our gross profit rate declined percentage points to comparable to the rate achieved in fiscal included in the fiscal cost of sales was a million charge associated with the write down of inventory caused by the exit of the federated leased department store business of the stride rite children s group 
additional discussion regarding this write down of inventory can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
excluding this charge  the gross profit rate for fiscal would have been  percentage point higher than fiscal first quality gross profit declined percentage points from the level achieved in fiscal  principally the result of an unfavorable product mix within the keds product lines 
obsolescence costs also contributed to a decline in gross profit of percentage points as compared to fiscal operating costs selling and administrative expenses excluding nonrecurring charges in fiscal increased million to million or above the expense level incurred in fiscal as a percent of sales  selling and administrative costs were in compared to in fiscal included in expenses for fiscal were executive termination costs of million 
excluding these executive termination costs  selling and administrative costs would have been lower by million  or below fiscal retail store expenses in fiscal increased million from fiscal as we accelerated our pace of store openings during the year 
offsetting these higher costs were lower marketing and advertising spending  down million or from fiscal most of this decrease occurred in the keds and tommy hilfiger brands 
restructuring charges during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we initiated a restructuring which eliminated positions from our administrative staff  exited the leased department store business and recorded retail system asset impairment costs 
the restructuring actions were expected to reduce operating costs by approximately million annually beginning in the first quarter of fiscal the consolidated statement of income includes pre tax  charges of million to cover costs associated with these restructuring efforts 
the restructuring amount includes 
table of contents million of severance payments  million of other employee benefit related costs  million for the write down of leaseholds and retail system asset impairment costs  million for the consolidation of a returns and product sample facility to a new location and million of other costs 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded income of  
per share after tax related to the reversal of unused prior year restructuring accruals 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the company recorded pre tax restructuring charges of  
per share after tax related to a restructuring of its administrative staff to competitively position itself for future expansion and increased profitability 
certain merchandising  finance and operations functions were shifted from divisional to centralized responsibility  resulting in the termination of associates and the elimination of unfilled positions from the company s administrative staff 
cash payments and other non cash items for this restructuring included  related to severance payments   related to other employee related costs and  of other costs associated with the restructuring 
costs related to this restructuring and charged in fiscal included  related to severance  and  related to other employee related costs 
other income and taxes non operating income expense increased our pre tax earnings by million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal investment income decreased by million in fiscal  the result of lower average investments and a lower average rate of return 
interest expense in fiscal decreased from fiscal  million as a higher average borrowing level was offset by a lower average interest rate 
the average interest rate was in fiscal year and in fiscal in fiscal  other income and expense items decreased pre tax income by million  compared to a decrease of million in fiscal in fiscal  the provision for income taxes decreased million due to a reduction in pre tax income and a lower effective tax rate 
the lower tax rate in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due principally to a reduction in the need for certain tax accruals recorded in prior periods which were no longer required 
our effective income tax rate was in and in net income we earned million in fiscal  million or below fiscal s net income amount 
excluding the nonrecurring charges in fiscal related to the restructuring of our administrative staff  the exit of the leased department store business and retail system asset impairment costs  net income would have decreased  million or in fiscal  to million as compared to million in fiscal the reduced earnings in fiscal resulted from the lower level of net sales and the reduced gross profit percent during the year somewhat offset by the lower income tax rate 
liquidity and capital resources at the end of fiscal  our balance sheet reflected a current ratio of with no debt 
our cash and cash equivalents totaled million at november   down million from the total cash and cash equivalents of million at the end of fiscal this decrease in our cash balance was primarily the result of the repayment of million of short term bank debt combined with the repurchase of million of the company s common stock 
during fiscal  our operations generated million  significantly greater than the operating cash flows of million in fiscal and million in fiscal our accounts receivable level of million  increased million from the year earlier levels 
the higher level of accounts receivable was primarily the result of the increase in fourth quarter sales  which were up million or 
at november   our average day s sales outstanding dso totaled days  favorable compared to both the dso of days at year end and the dso of days at year end much of this improvement in dso is attributable to more effectively pursuing past due receivables and customer chargebacks 
year end inventories 
table of contents totaled million  which was million or lower than the million at fiscal year end the inventory decrease in fiscal followed an increase of million in fiscal during fiscal year  our inventory turnover averaged times which compares favorably to the lower turnover rate of times during fiscal  but similar to the times turnover rate realized in fiscal the improved inventory performance during fiscal was the result of shortened production lead times  which allow for reduced inventory quantities  the effective sale of close out products and our efforts to monitor the sell through performance of our larger retail customers to better forecast product demand 
somewhat offsetting the improved inventory performance were accelerated inventory receipts in anticipation of potential disruptions related to the labor dispute at the west coast ports 
additions to property and equipment totaled million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal capital expenditures in fiscal included million related to both new retail stores and the renovation of existing retail locations 
during fiscal we opened children s group retail stores and one keds retail store 
the large number of store openings in the year more than offset our exit of the federated leased department store business and its locations 
in fiscal years and we opened and new retail stores  respectively 
during the fiscal year our current plans call for the addition of fewer than new retail stores as we concentrate on improving the operating performance of the significant number of new locations opened during the past several years 
in fiscal year  we are planning capital expenditures to be approximately million 
the renovation of existing stores and a new retail merchandise planning system are the most significant items planned 
funding for our capital expenditures is expected to be provided from internal sources 
if business conditions are not favorable and do not allow for the funding of capital purchases internally  our plans will be re evaluated 
our pension liabilities increased significantly in fiscal due to the declines in investment performance and interest rates 
these pension liabilities are developed from actuarial calculations and valuations 
inherent in these valuations are assumptions  including discount rates and the expected return on plan assets 
the expected long term rate of return on our plan assets was developed by examining historical return rates based on the pension plan s asset allocation and considering such factors as return differentials for active investment management 
due to the long term nature of this assumption  it is not expected that the rate of return percentage will vary yearly 
the expected long term rate of return for fiscal year will be  which is lower than the rate used in the prior fiscal year 
the discount rate used for the calculation of plan liabilities at fiscal year end was  which is basis points below the rate used in fiscal we consider market conditions  including changes in interest and investment rates  in developing these assumptions 
at fiscal year end we recorded a non cash minimum pension liability of million dollars 
this liability was created by the shortfall of plan assets versus the accumulated benefit obligation 
pension expense  a non cash item  for fiscal was million and it is expected to increase to approximately million in fiscal during the fiscal year we contributed million to the company s defined benefit pension plan 
current plans for fiscal year anticipate a pension contribution of a similar amount 
during fiscal year we returned million to shareholders through share repurchases and cash dividends 
we spent million in fiscal to repurchase million common shares under our share repurchase program 
over the three year period ended november   we repurchased a total of million common shares at an aggregate cost of million 
as of november   we have million shares remaining on our share repurchase authorization that the board of directors approved in september we believe that share repurchases are a good investment and an effective means of providing value to our shareholders and plan to continue to make opportunistic share repurchases during the fiscal year 
we have paid a dividend to our shareholders each quarter since we became a public company in we used million of cash for dividends during fiscal  which was comparable to the million in fiscal  but somewhat below the million in fiscal funds for these share repurchases and dividends were provided from internal sources 
under the terms or our revolving credit agreement  we are not allowed to make annual distributions to shareholders in excess of million 
both dividend payments and share repurchases are considered distributions to shareholders 

table of contents during the normal course of business  our financial position and results of operations are routinely subject to a variety of risks  including the market risk associated with interest rate movements on short term borrowings and cash equivalents 
additionally  economic conditions in countries where we source our products could negatively affect future inventory purchase commitments 
we purchase substantially all of our inventory from outside the united states 
because these purchases are primarily denominated in us dollars  we are not directly subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
accordingly  we do not engage in forward foreign exchange and other similar contracts because the associated risk is not considered significant 
if circumstances should change and we conclude that the hedging of foreign exchange risks becomes appropriate  we will begin to do so 
we utilize cash from operations  short term investments and short term borrowings to fund our working capital and investment needs 
in addition to internal sources of funding  we maintain a bank line of credit to satisfy the seasonal borrowing requirements that are imposed by the sales patterns that are characteristic of stride rite and of the footwear industry 
because of these seasonal demands  there are times during the year when we are less liquid 
during fiscal  we entered into a three year  revolving credit agreement with five banks providing for loans of up to million 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we renewed this line of credit with substantially the same group of banks for an additional three year period 
the revolving credit agreement requires us to meet certain financial ratios and covenants and to maintain a minimum consolidated tangible net worth 
under the terms of the revolving credit agreement  we may borrow at interest rates that vary with libor 
in addition  the agreement calls for facility fees of per annum on the committed line 
at year end  we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit line  leaving the entire million available for use 
during fiscal  our borrowings averaged million compared to the average borrowings of million in fiscal and million in fiscal as of november   letters of credit for million were outstanding for the purchase of inventories 
all letters of credit generally expire within one year 
our significant long term financial obligations as of november  are as follows cash payments due during the fiscal years in thousands description of commitment thereafter total operating leases recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 business combinations 
sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  and specifies criteria for recognizing intangible assets separate from goodwill

as of the adoption date  amortization of outstanding goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets will cease 
as required by sfas  we will perform impairment tests annually and whenever events or circumstances indicate that the value of goodwill or other indefinite lived intangible assets might be impaired 
in connection with the sfas indefinite lived intangible asset impairment test  we will utilize the required one step method to determine whether an impairment exists as of the adoption date 
in connection with the sfas transitional goodwill impairment test  we will utilize the required two step method for determining goodwill impairment as of the adoption date 
the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our financial position and results of operations are routinely subject to a variety of risks  including market risk associated with interest rate movements on borrowings and investments and currency rate movements on non us dollar denominated assets  liabilities and income 
we regularly assess these risks and have established policies and business practices to protect against the adverse effect of these and other potential exposures 
we utilize cash from operations and short term borrowings to fund our working capital and investment needs 
cash balances are normally invested in high grade securities with terms shorter than three months 
because of the short term nature of these investments  changes in interest rates would not materially affect the fair value of these financial instruments 
we have available a million unsecured committed revolving line of credit as a source of financing for our working capital requirements 
borrowings under this revolving credit agreement bear interest at variable 
table of contents rates based on libor plus an applicable spread 
at november   we had no borrowings outstanding under this credit facility 
assets and liabilities outside the united states are primarily located in canada 
our investment in foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar  are generally considered long term 
we do not generally hedge these net investments
