item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition understanding our financial information our fiscal financial information is summarized in this management s discussion and analysis  the consolidated financial statements  and the related notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the following items are intended to assist you in understanding our financial information 
organization of financial information management s discussion and analysis provides material historical and prospective disclosures intended to enable investors and other users to assess our results of operations and financial condition 
statements that are not historical are forward looking and involve risks and uncertainties discussed under the caption forward looking statements in item of this annual report on form k 
the consolidated financial statements and notes are presented in item of this annual report on form k 
included in the consolidated financial statements are the consolidated statements of earnings  consolidated balance sheets  consolidated statements of cash flows  and consolidated statement of changes in stockholders equity 
the notes  which are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements  provide additional information required to fully understand the nature of amounts included in the consolidated financial statements 
financial trends throughout these financial sections  you will read about both recurring and one time transactions or events 
one time transactions discussed in this management s discussion and analysis include the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  restructuring and other expense income  goodwill amortization change  and a one time federal tax refund 
these one time transactions result from unique facts and circumstances that likely will not recur with similar materiality or impact on continuing operations 
while these items are important in understanding and evaluating financial results and trends  other transactions or events such as those discussed later in this management s discussion and analysis may also have a material impact 
a complete understanding of these transactions is necessary in order to estimate the likelihood that these trends will continue 
accounting policies and critical accounting estimates in preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  we must make decisions which impact the reported amounts and the related disclosures 
such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates 
in reaching such decisions  we apply judgments based on our understanding and analysis of the relevant circumstances  historical experience  and actuarial valuations 
actual amounts could differ from those estimated at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
not all of these significant accounting policies require us to make difficult subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
however  we believe the following accounting policies  which require more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  could be deemed to be critical within the securities and exchange commission s sec proposed rules related to critical accounting policy disclosure 
warranty reserve 
we establish a reserve for future warranty claims at the time of sale based on historical claims experience by product line 
we also establish reserves for special rework campaigns for known major product modifications 
warranty coverage ranges from a period of six months to seven years  and covers parts  labor  and other expenses for non maintenance repairs  provided operator abuse  improper use  or negligence did not necessitate the repair 
actual claims could be materially higher than the reserve accrued at the time of sale due both to the long warranty period offered and to the possibility that actual claims could be higher than the reserve if a significant manufacturing or design defect is not discovered until after the product is delivered to customers 
we believe that analysis of historical trends and knowledge of potential manufacturing or design problems provide sufficient information to establish an estimate for warranty claims at the time of sale 
accounts and notes receivable valuation 
we establish a reserve for specific accounts and notes receivable that we believe are uncollectible  as well as an estimate of uncollectible receivables not specifically known 
each quarter  we evaluate past collection history  the age of the receivable  current financial conditions of key customers  and economic conditions when establishing an allowance for doubtful accounts 
portions of the accounts receivable are protected by a security interest in products held by customers  which minimizes our collection exposure 
a deterioration in the financial condition of any key customer or a significant continued slow down in the economy could have a material negative impact on our ability to collect a portion or all of the accounts and notes receivable  if the value of the security declines 
therefore  our reserve for uncollectible receivables could potentially be under estimated 
new accounting pronouncement adopted in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives may no longer be amortized but instead tested for impairment annually at the reporting unit level using a two step impairment test 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements that shows adjusted net earnings and earnings per share data for the adoption of sfas no 
effective november   we adopted sfas no 
we tested for impairment of our reporting units by comparing fair value to carrying value 
fair value was determined using a discounted cash flow and cost methodology 
an evaluation of the fair value of our agricultural irrigation reporting unit indicated that all the goodwill recorded for acquisitions in the agricultural irrigation market was impaired 
the performance of these acquired businesses has not met management s original expectations 
this is due mainly to lower than anticipated growth rates in the drip line market  which has resulted in lower industry wide pricing and margins on product sales 
accordingly  non cash impairment charges on adoption of sfas no 
of million  net of income tax benefit of million  were recognized as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the first quarter of fiscal results of operations fiscal was a record setting year for both net sales and earnings before one time transactions 
adjusted net earnings grew percent and net sales rose by percent despite adverse economic conditions 
during fiscal  we successfully introduced new products  focused on improving asset management  and continued our emphasis on the profit improvement program called by five 
the goal of this program is to improve our after tax return on sales 
the major initiatives to achieve this goal include revising and transforming how we manufacture  purchase  distribute  market  and service products  improving or discontinuing low performing product lines  and reviewing our expense structure to eliminate low value activities 
net earnings fiscal net earnings were million compared to million in fiscal results for fiscal included the following three one time items a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle that reduced net earnings by million for the goodwill write off related to the adoption of sfas no 
 restructuring and other expense of million million net of tax  and a tax refund that reduced tax expense by million 
adjusted to exclude these items  diluted net earnings per share for fiscal were 
in fiscal  results included million of restructuring and other income million net of tax and million of goodwill amortization million net of tax 
adjusted to exclude these items  diluted net earnings per share for fiscal were 
the adjusted diluted net earnings per share increase of percent was due mainly to higher sales volumes  improved gross profit  and lower interest costs  partially offset by higher selling  general  and administrative expense 
fiscal net earnings per share before restructuring income and comparable for goodwill amortization were percent higher than fiscal this increase was primarily due to lower interest costs  lower levels of exchange rate currency losses  and a decline in selling  general  and administrative expense as a percentage of sales  somewhat offset by lower gross profit 
the following tables summarize the one time changes in net earnings and diluted earnings per share data  net of tax effect dollars in thousands years ended october net earnings as reported    add subtract cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  restructuring and other expense income  goodwill amortization expense   one time tax refund  adjusted net earnings    diluted per share data years ended october diluted earnings per share as reported add subtract cumulative effect of change in accounting principle restructuring and other expense income goodwill amortization expense one time tax refund adjusted diluted earnings per share as we enter fiscal  the improved operating fundamentals from by five initiatives  benefits from moving production to lower cost manufacturing facilities  and market share positions for our businesses should give us momentum for another good year 
however  a great deal of uncertainty remains in the economy 
in fiscal  we expect diluted net earnings per share before one time transactions to grow at a low double digit rate over fiscal fiscal compared with fiscal net sales 
worldwide net sales in fiscal were  million compared to  million in fiscal  an increase of percent 
positive reaction to and initial stocking orders for the new moderate priced line of toro walk power mowers led this increase 
in addition  positive acceptance of new product introductions across many product lines contributed to the sales growth 
the acquisition of a distribution company in the third quarter of fiscal added million of incremental net sales for fiscal international sales grew percent driven primarily by new product introductions and stronger than expected demand in the asian golf market 
disregarding currency effects  international sales were up percent for the year 
professional segment sales were up slightly for the year also due to new product introductions 
however  landscape contractor equipment shipments were down as we and our customers took action to reduce field inventory levels 
looking ahead  we expect an improvement in sales growth in fiscal compared to the sales growth in fiscal  driven primarily by the introduction of new products and anticipated continued growth from our lawn mower strategy 
we also expect that the reduction of field inventory levels of landscape contractor equipment in fiscal should contribute to sales growth in fiscal gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales was percent in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal this increase was mainly the result of i cost reduction efforts that included moving production to lower cost facilities and ii lower material costs resulting from our by five program initiatives 
somewhat offsetting those positive factors were i a higher proportion of sales of the new lower margin toro walk power mowers  ii higher manufacturing costs from lower plant utilization as we curtailed production levels in response to lower professional segment sales and to implement management s efforts to reduce customers and our inventory levels  iii higher floor plan expenses  and iv elimination of gross profit previously recorded with respect to sales of toro products to a customer that is currently experiencing financial difficulties 
looking ahead  gross profit is expected to improve as a result of closing some manufacturing facilities and moving some production to lower cost facilities during fiscal these changes are expected to result in higher plant utilization and reduced costs in fiscal compared to fiscal  benefiting gross profit next year 
selling  general  and administrative expense sg a 
adjusted to exclude goodwill amortization  sg a expense increased percent from last year 
factoring out the acquisition of a distribution company in fiscal and excluding goodwill amortization for the purpose of comparison  sg a expense as a percentage of net sales was percent in fiscal and percent in fiscal this increase was due to the following factors i higher bad debt expense  ii higher incentive compensation costs  iii increased legal and information service spending  and iv rising insurance costs 
restructuring and other expense income 
restructuring and other expense for fiscal was million 
during fiscal  we announced the closing of three manufacturing operations 
these actions were part of our long term strategy to reduce production costs and improve long term competitiveness 
closing these facilities resulted in a pre tax restructuring and other expense charge of million 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a benefit of million for the reversal of accruals on the previous closings recorded in the first quarter of fiscal  mainly as a result of the decision not to relocate the non manufacturing portion of our facility at riverside  california 
the combination of the charge and benefit resulted in million pre tax restructuring and other expense for fiscal we also incurred a million charge for asset impairment related to the write off of patents and non compete agreements in the agricultural irrigation business 
based on our evaluation of the recoverability of some acquired intangible assets  we determined that the acquired patents and non compete agreements in the agricultural irrigation business had no future value due to changes in this business 
during fiscal  we had pre tax restructuring and other income of million 
this income was derived from the reversal of the remaining accrual for closing of the sardis  mississippi facility  which was sold in fiscal interest expense 
interest expense for fiscal declined percent compared to fiscal due primarily to lower levels of short term debt as a result of using prior years earnings to pay down debt  improved asset management during the second half of fiscal  and lower interest rates 
other income  net 
other income  net for fiscal declined million or percent compared to fiscal this decrease was due to the following factors i lower levels of finance charge revenue  ii lower currency exchange rate gains  iii increased litigation expense  and iv lower levels of insurance recoveries 
somewhat offsetting those negative factors were i increased gains on the disposal of property  plant  and equipment  mainly for a gain on the sale of one of our owned facilities located in riverside  california  ii lower levels of valuation charges for investments  and iii higher royalty income 
provision for income taxes 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was percent compared to percent in fiscal  before a one time federal tax refund of million in fiscal including the one time federal tax refund  the effective tax rate was percent for fiscal the decrease was due mainly to the adoption of sfas no 
that eliminated goodwill amortization expense as of the beginning of fiscal most of the goodwill amortization was not deductible for tax purposes 
the tax rate decrease was also due to increased benefits from foreign tax strategies related to our foreign sales corporation 
the one time federal tax refund of million related to our foreign sales corporation from prior fiscal years 
looking ahead to fiscal  we expect the effective tax rate will be approximately the same effective tax rate in fiscal  before the one time tax benefit 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
 we performed an evaluation of goodwill as of november  as described previously  the results of this evaluation indicated that goodwill related to the agricultural irrigation reporting unit was impaired 
we therefore recognized a million non cash charge  net of income tax benefit of million  as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
fiscal compared with fiscal net sales 
worldwide net sales in fiscal were  million compared to  million in fiscal  an increase of percent 
growth in the landscape contractor market  positive acceptance of new products  and acquisitions led the slight sales increase  but a weak economy and unfavorable spring and summer weather conditions hampered growth 
gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales was percent in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal this decline was a result of the following factors i lower sales of higher margin products  ii increased levels of price support provided to international customers when the us dollar was strong  and iii higher manufacturing costs  mainly for irrigation products because of lower plant utilization 
somewhat offsetting these declines were i lower levels of tooling amortization expense due to fully amortized tooling in fiscal compared to fiscal  ii increased gross profit for the residential segment as a result of increased sales of higher margin products  and iii cost reduction efforts 
we also began experiencing positive results from lower purchasing costs as part of our by five program initiatives 
selling  general  and administrative expense sg a 
as a percentage of net sales  sg a decreased to percent from percent in fiscal acquisitions added million of incremental sg a expense 
factoring out acquisitions  sg a expense would have decreased million or percent as a percentage of net sales 
this decline was due to lower warranty expense and marketing costs 
somewhat offsetting those declines were higher incentive compensation costs  higher engineering expenses  and increased administrative expense related to higher bad debt  legal  and information service costs 
interest expense 
fiscal interest expense decreased percent compared to fiscal this decrease was due primarily to lower levels of average short term debt as a result of improved asset management  the use of earnings from the past months to pay down debt  and lower interest rates 
other income  net 
other income  net was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this increase was due to lower levels of both exchange rate currency losses and write down of investments compared to fiscal  as well as recoveries of previous write offs of notes receivable 
this increase was somewhat offset by lower levels of insurance recoveries in fiscal compared to fiscal and higher litigation costs 
provision for income taxes 
the effective tax rate for fiscal was unchanged from percent in fiscal business segments as more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we operate in three reportable segments  professional  residential  and distribution 
a fourth segment called other consists of corporate and financing functions 
operating earnings loss by segment is defined as earnings loss from operations plus other income  net  for the professional  residential  and distribution segments 
the other segment operating loss consists of corporate activities  including corporate financing activities  other income  net  and interest expense 
the following information provides perspective on our business segments sales and operating results 
professional net sales 
in fiscal  professional segment net sales represented percent of consolidated net sales 
worldwide net sales for the professional segment in fiscal were up slightly by percent compared to fiscal commercial equipment product sales were up for the year driven by successful new product introductions 
irrigation product sales also increased compared to last year due to lower field inventory levels entering the year and favorable weather conditions 
international shipments were also higher for the year due to the successful introduction of new products and stronger than expected demand in the asian golf market 
somewhat offsetting those increases were lower shipments of landscape contractor equipment as we and our customers reduced field inventory levels 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  retail demand for landscape contractor equipment declined unexpectedly following the september events that resulted in lower consumer confidence and spending as well as the economic recession 
however  our distribution customers did not reduce orders and therefore we did not reduce shipments of landscape contractor equipment before the end of fiscal due to the unexpected decline in retail demand 
this resulted in higher than planned field inventory levels entering fiscal steps were taken in the first half of fiscal to lower field inventory levels by curtailing manufacturing production as well as customers reduced orders 
on a positive note  retail demand was up in fiscal compared to fiscal for landscape contractor equipment 
worldwide net sales for the professional segment in fiscal were down slightly by percent compared to fiscal a weaker economy  unfavorable weather conditions  and a slow down in new golf course construction had a negative effect on worldwide shipments of commercial equipment and irrigation systems 
sales were also lower for residential commercial irrigation products due to unfavorable economic conditions and weather as well as high irritrol brand field inventory levels entering fiscal sitework systems shipments declined compared to fiscal due to challenges in setting up a new dealer channel resulting from a change to dealer direct distribution in fiscal the decline in sales was somewhat offset by customer acceptance of new products and the addition of product line sales from goossen industries inc  which was acquired in fiscal landscape contractor equipment sales were also up due to higher volume shipments for both toro and exmark brand mowers 
looking ahead  sales for the professional segment are expected to grow in fiscal compared to fiscal we anticipate revenue growth for grounds equipment as we increase our focus on the grounds maintenance market 
sales of landscape contractor equipment are also expected to grow in fiscal as a result of introducing new products and anticipated growth in the landscape contractor market 
in addition  fiscal results are expected to improve when compared to fiscal results  which were negatively impacted by efforts to reduce field inventory levels 
as we enter fiscal  field inventory levels for landscape contractor equipment are lower compared to last year 
sales of residential commercial irrigation products are also expected to show solid growth in fiscal as we introduce new products and increase manufacturing capacity in anticipation of higher demand 
sales to the golf market are expected to be flat to slightly up with the continued trend of slower golf course construction 
in addition  the number of golf rounds played is anticipated to be slightly up next year 
operating earnings 
adjusted to exclude goodwill amortization and restructuring and other expense for comparable purposes  operating earnings for the professional segment increased percent in fiscal compared to fiscal expressed as a percentage of net sales  professional segment operating margins increased to percent from percent last year 
this increase was due to higher gross margins as a result of cost reduction efforts and lower material costs  somewhat offset by higher manufacturing costs described previously and higher floor plan expenses 
other income  net was also higher  contributing to the profit increase 
somewhat offsetting this improvement were higher sg a costs due to increased incentive compensation  insurance  and marketing expenses 
as a percentage of net sales  fiscal professional segment operating margins increased to percent from percent in fiscal lower sg a expense as a percentage of net sales contributed to this profit improvement due to a decline in warranty and marketing costs 
other income  net also contributed to this improvement due to lower levels of exchange rate currency losses and lower write down of investments compared to fiscal however  gross margins as a percentage of net sales declined due to lower sales of higher margin products  higher manufacturing costs related to lower plant utilization  and continued increase in levels of price support provided to international customers as a result of weak foreign currencies relative to the us dollar 
looking ahead  professional segment earnings are expected to improve in fiscal compared to fiscal due to expected sales growth and anticipated benefits generated from by five initiatives 
residential net sales 
in fiscal  residential segment net sales represented percent of consolidated net sales 
worldwide net sales for the residential segment in fiscal were up by percent compared to fiscal walk power mower sales led this increase due to positive reaction to and initial stocking shipments for the new moderate priced line of toro walk power mowers sold at the home depot and through our dealer network 
sales of retail irrigation products were also higher due to additional regional shelf space with a key customer  new product introductions  and increased demand in australia due to dry weather conditions and a stronger australian dollar compared to the us dollar 
home solutions product sales  mainly electric trimmers  also increased due to continued placement expansion and strong retail demand 
somewhat offsetting those increases were lower shipments of riding products due to continued weak economic conditions that have resulted in lower sales of higher priced products as well as strong competition and consumer preference for lower priced units 
in addition  fiscal sales had been unusually high because of initial stocking shipments of new riding products  such as the timecutter zx mower and the twister utility vehicle 
lawn boy walk power mower shipments also declined as a result of lost shelf space for the cycle engine models at a home center customer 
snowthrower shipments were also down compared to last year because the mild snow season resulted in higher field inventory levels entering the winter season 
therefore  fiscal snowthrower sales were lower compared to abnormally high sales in fiscal as a result of low field inventory levels when we entered the winter season 
worldwide net sales for the residential segment in fiscal were up by percent compared to fiscal snowthrower shipments were up significantly in fiscal due to heavy snowfall in the winter of  which depleted field inventory levels entering the winter season 
strong domestic riding product shipments also contributed to the increase in sales in fiscal  mainly for new products  which included the timecutter zx mower and the twister utility vehicle 
home solutions product sales  including trimmers and blowers  also increased due to placement expansion at some mass retailers 
offsetting those increases were lower worldwide shipments of walk power mowers due to weak economic conditions resulting from a slow down in consumer spending as well as cold and wet spring weather in most markets that resulted in lower retail demand 
retail irrigation sales also declined for the year due mainly to lost placement at some home centers 
looking ahead  residential segment sales are expected to grow in fiscal compared to fiscal as we introduce new products  such as the timecutter z mowers  a smaller  lighter weight version of the timecutter zx 
this segment is also expected to benefit from an anticipated increase in retail demand for the moderate priced line of toro walk power mowers 
operating earnings 
adjusted to exclude goodwill amortization and restructuring and other income for comparable purposes  operating earnings for the residential segment increased percent in fiscal compared to fiscal expressed as a percentage of net sales  residential segment operating margins increased to percent from percent last year 
this increase was due mainly to leveraging fixed sg a costs over higher sales volumes 
somewhat offsetting this profit improvement was a decline in gross margins due to lower margins on the new moderate priced line of walk power mowers  higher manufacturing costs  and increased floor plan expenses 
as a percentage of net sales  fiscal residential segment operating margins  excluding restructuring and other income  increased to percent from percent in fiscal gross margin rose as a percentage of net sales due to increased sales of higher margin products  continued cost reduction efforts  and lower amounts of tooling amortization expense due to fully amortized tooling  somewhat offset by higher levels of price support provided to international customers 
however  sg a expense as a percentage of net sales was higher due mainly to increased warranty expense 
looking ahead  residential segment earnings are expected to improve in fiscal compared to fiscal as we continue to experience benefits generated by by five initiatives in addition to expected higher sales volumes and reduced product costs as a result of moving some production of toro brand walk power mowers to juarez  mexico 
distribution net sales 
net sales for the distribution segment in fiscal increased percent compared to fiscal the sales increase was due to additional volume contributed by a distribution company acquired in fiscal  which added million of incremental net sales for the distribution segment in fiscal factoring out sales from this acquisition  net sales for the distribution segment would have been down percent 
this decline was due to weak economic conditions  mainly in the golf market  which resulted in lower commercial equipment and irrigation product sales 
in fiscal  net sales for the distribution segment increased percent compared to fiscal the sales increase was due to additional volume contributed by two acquired distribution companies during fiscal  which added million of incremental net sales for the distribution segment in fiscal factoring out sales from these two acquisitions  net sales for the distribution segment would have been down million or percent 
this decline was related to the weak economy and unfavorable weather conditions  which delayed golf course projects 
because we have entered into an agreement to sell one of the distribution companies in fiscal  we expect sales for this segment to be lower than in fiscal excluding the effects of this planned disposition  sales for the distribution segment are expected to grow slightly in fiscal compared to fiscal operating earnings losses 
operating earnings for the distribution segment in fiscal were million compared to operating losses of million in fiscal this substantial profit improvement was due mainly to operating improvements and cost reductions at some of the company owned distributorships 
operating losses in fiscal were million compared to operating earnings of million in fiscal  an unfavorable change of million 
sg a costs were higher because we acquired two distribution companies  which added million of incremental sg a costs 
in addition  costs for investments and operational restructuring reduced operating profits in some of the distributorships 
because we have entered into an agreement to sell one of the distribution companies in fiscal  we expect operating earnings for this segment to be lower than in fiscal excluding the effects of this planned disposition  operating earnings for the distribution segment are expected to grow in fiscal compared to fiscal other net sales 
net sales for the other segment include the elimination of sales from the professional and residential segments to the distribution segment 
shipments from the professional and residential segments to the toro owned distribution companies are eliminated because consolidated results reflect those sales in the distribution segment after products are sold by the company owned distributorships 
in addition  elimination of the professional and residential segments floor plan interest costs from toro credit company is also included in this segment 
the other segment net sales elimination in fiscal increased percent compared to fiscal this increase was due mainly to additional sales eliminated for a distribution company acquired in fiscal the other segment net sales elimination in fiscal increased percent compared to fiscal this increase was due mainly to additional sales eliminated for two distribution companies acquired during fiscal operating loss 
operating loss for the other segment in fiscal increased percent compared to fiscal this unfavorable change was due to higher incentive compensation  increased bad debt expense  higher legal costs  rising insurance costs  and higher information service spending  although the increases were somewhat offset by a decline in interest expense 
operating loss in fiscal increased percent compared to fiscal this increase was due to higher corporate expenses  mainly for incentive compensation  information service costs  legal costs  and bad debt expense 
these negative factors were offset somewhat by lower interest costs and higher amounts of other income  net 
financial position working capital in fiscal  our major emphasis was improving asset management and reducing average short term debt 
we believe our efforts are paying off  as reflected in the following table  which highlights several key measures of our working capital performance dollars in millions years ended october average working capital average working capital as percent of sales average short term debt average days receivables outstanding inventory turnover x x the increase in average working capital was due primarily to lower average short term debt in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of strong cash flow from operations  we were able to reduce average short term debt by percent in fiscal average days outstanding for receivables improved to days in fiscal compared to days in fiscal due primarily to a higher proportion of sales that have shorter payment terms 
average inventory turnover improved percent as a result of lower average inventory from improved asset management  but also reflected lower production levels as professional segment sales declined and management worked to reduce both customers and our own inventory levels 
we expect that average working capital in fiscal will increase slightly compared to fiscal due to higher planned sales volumes which are expected to increase average levels of accounts receivable and inventory 
average inventory is also expected to increase  but at a lower rate than our anticipated fiscal sales growth 
long term assets long term assets as of october  were million compared to million as of october   a decrease of percent 
net property  plant  and equipment increased by million due to higher spending on capital equipment and tooling  mainly for plant expansion in mexico 
goodwill and other assets decreased million from fiscal due mainly to the goodwill and other intangible asset write offs in the agricultural irrigation business as part of the adoption of sfas no 
capital structure the following table details our total capitalization components and key ratios dollars in millions years ended october short term debt long term debt stockholders equity debt to capital ratio ebitda interest coverage x x ebitda interest coverage earnings before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  restructuring and other expense income  interest expense  taxes  depreciation  and amortization divided by interest expense improved in fiscal compared to fiscal due primarily to lower interest expense 
the total debt to capital ratio improvement in fiscal compared to fiscal was due mainly to lower debt as a result of improved asset management during october  compared to october  liquidity and capital resources our businesses are working capital intensive and require funding for purchases of production and replacement parts inventory  capital expenditures  expansion and upgrading of existing facilities  as well as for financing receivables from customers 
we believe that cash generated from operations  together with our fixed rate long term debt  short and medium term bank credit lines  and cash on hand  provide us with adequate liquidity to meet our operating requirements 
we believe that the combination of funds available through existing or anticipated financing arrangements  coupled with forecasted cash flows  will provide the necessary capital resources for our anticipated working capital  capital additions  long term debt repayments  and stock repurchases in the next fiscal year 
cash flow 
our primary source of funds is cash generated from operations 
in fiscal  cash provided by operating activities increased by percent from fiscal this significant improvement was a result of our efforts to reduce inventory and receivables described previously  as well as higher earnings before non cash expenses 
capital expenditures continue to be a primary use of capital resources 
cash used in investing activities increased by percent due to higher purchases of property  plant  and equipment in fiscal compared to fiscal for our addition and expansion of manufacturing facilities 
this increase was somewhat offset by no acquisitions consummated in fiscal capital expenditures for fiscal are planned to be slightly higher than fiscal due to the completion of the juarez  mexico facility as well as investments in manufacturing equipment  tooling  and information service technology 
cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this increase of million was primarily because we repaid short term debt during fiscal compared to borrowing short term debt in fiscal share repurchase plan 
on september   the board of directors authorized us to repurchase an additional  shares of toro common stock 
as of october    shares remained authorized for repurchase 
this repurchase program provides shares for use in connection with acquisitions and employee compensation plans so that even with the issuance of shares under those plans  the number of outstanding shares remains relatively constant and the impact on net earnings per share of issuing such shares is minimal 
in fiscal  we repurchased  shares of common stock on the open market for million at an average price of per share 
in fiscal  we repurchased  shares for million at an average price of per share 
in fiscal  we repurchased  shares for million at an average price of per share 
credit lines and other capital resources 
under working capital agreements with various banks  our us seasonal working capital requirements are funded with million of committed unsecured bank credit lines 
under these working capital agreements  we can also borrow in currencies other than us dollars 
interest expense on these credit lines is based on libor plus a basis point spread defined in the working capital agreements 
in addition  our non us operations and a domestic subsidiary also maintain unsecured short term lines of credit of approximately million 
these facilities bear interest at various rates depending on the rates in their respective countries of operation 
we also have a letter of credit sub facility as part of the above working capital agreements 
as of october   we had million of unutilized availability under these working capital agreements 
average borrowings were million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in average short term debt resulted primarily from lower average net inventory  higher levels of accounts payable  and the use of cash earnings from the past months to pay down debt 
significant financial covenants in the working capital agreements are interest coverage and debt to total capitalization ratios 
we were in compliance with all covenants related to the working capital agreements as of october   and expect to be in compliance with all covenants in fiscal if we were out of compliance with any debt covenant required by the working capital agreements  the banks could terminate their commitments unless we could negotiate a covenant waiver from the banks 
in addition  our long term public notes and debentures could become due and payable if we were unable to obtain a covenant waiver or refinance our short term debt under our working capital agreements 
if our credit rating falls below investment grade  the interest rate we currently pay on outstanding debt on the working capital agreements would increase  but the credit commitments could not be cancelled by the banks based only on a ratings downgrade 
our debt rating for long term unsecured senior  non credit enhanced debt has been unchanged for the past year by standard and poor s ratings group at bbb and by moody s investors service at baa our business is seasonal  with accounts receivable balances historically increasing between january and april as a result of higher sales volumes and extended payment terms made available to our customers  and decreasing between may and december when payments are received 
our peak borrowing usually occurs between february and may 
seasonal working capital requirements are financed primarily with short and medium term financing arrangements described above 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of october  dollars in thousands less than after obligation year years years years total long term debt     operating leases      total cash obligations      as of october   we also had million in outstanding letters of credit issued during the normal course of business  as required by some vendor contracts 
we also have guaranteed debts incurred by distributors  aggregating million as of october  customer financing wholesale financing 
toro credit company tcc  a wholly owned financing subsidiary  provides financing for our north american distributors and approximately domestic dealers for select products that we manufacture 
independent toro and exmark distributors and dealers that do not finance through tcc generally finance their inventories with third party financing companies 
tcc and other third party finance companies purchase selected receivables from us and our distributors and dealers for extended periods  which assists those customers to carry representative inventories of equipment 
down payments are not required and  depending on the finance program for each product line  finance charges are either incurred by us  shared between us and the distributor or dealer  or paid by the distributor or dealer 
we retain a security interest in the distributors and dealers inventories  and make periodic physical checks of those inventories 
under the sales terms to distributors and dealers  finance charges are charged to distributors and dealers on outstanding balances  from the earlier of the date when product is sold to a customer  or the expiration of company supported finance terms granted at the time of sale to the distributor or dealer  until payment is received by tcc or the third party finance company 
rates are generally fixed or based on prime rate plus a fixed percentage depending on whether the financing is for a distributor or dealer 
rates may also vary based on the product that is financed 
distributors and dealers cannot cancel purchases after goods are shipped and are responsible for payment even if the equipment is not sold to retail customers 
third party financing companies purchased million of receivables of our financed products during fiscal the outstanding receivable balance owed from our distributors and dealers to third party financing companies was million on october  we also enter into limited inventory repurchase agreements with third party financing companies 
as of october   we were contingently liable to repurchase up to million of inventory related to receivables under these financing arrangements 
we have repurchased only immaterial amounts of inventory from third party financing companies over the past three years 
however  a decline in retail sales could cause this situation to change and thereby require us to repurchase financed product 
end user financing 
during fiscal  we entered into an agreement with a third party financing company to provide lease financing options to domestic golf course and some grounds equipment customers 
the purpose of the agreement is a sales and marketing tool to give end user buyers of our products alternative financing options when purchasing our products 
under the terms of this agreement  we could be contingently liable for a portion of the credit collection and residual realization risk on the underlying equipment for leasing transactions financed under this program 
our maximum exposure for credit collection and residual value as of october  was million 
we have established a reserve for our estimated exposure related to this program 
under a provision of this agreement  if we maintain an investment grade credit rating  we are not required to provide any collateral 
if our credit rating falls below investment grade  we would be required to provide collateral in the form of a letter of credit  up to million 
in the normal course of business  we have arrangements with other financial institutions to provide various forms of financing options to end customers 
from time to time  our company owned distributorships also guarantee the residual value at the end of leases with third party financing companies for product sold to customers 
the amount of this potential contingent liability as of october  was million 
none of these other arrangements require any additional material financial involvement by us 
distributor financing 
we enter into long term loan and equity investment agreements with some distributors 
these transactions are used for expansion of the distributors businesses  acquisitions  refinancing working capital agreements  or ownership changes 
as of october   we have loaned and or invested million in several distribution companies 
this amount is included in other long term assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
inflation we are subject to the effects of inflation and changing prices 
in our opinion  changes in net sales and net earnings that have resulted from inflation and changing prices have not been material during the fiscal years presented 
however  there is no assurance that inflation will not materially affect us in the future 
we attempt to deal with these inflationary pressures by actively pursuing internal cost reduction efforts and introducing slight price increases 
market risk we are naturally exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and commodity prices 
our risk management policy is to hedge exposure of certain risks by entering into various hedging instruments to minimize market risk 
additional information is presented in item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
acquisitions in fiscal  we completed the purchase of a southwestern based distributor 
in fiscal  we acquired electronic industrial controls  inc  a provider of innovative computer control systems for the irrigation industry 
we also acquired certain operating assets of goossen industries  inc  a turf equipment manufacturer located in beatrice  nebraska 
related party transactions we have entered into related party transactions 
we sell products to a distribution company that is owned in part by an executive officer of toro 
this executive officer is currently on temporary assignment at toro and will return to the distributorship upon completion of his assignment 
in addition  we also sell products to companies whose executive officers are members of toro s board of directors 
we believe the transactions described above between us and related parties are at arms length and not material to the consolidated financial results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk stemming from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  and commodity prices 
changes in these factors could cause fluctuations in our net earnings and cash flows 
in the normal course of business  we actively manage the exposure of foreign currency market risk by entering into various hedging instruments  authorized under company policies that place controls on these activities  with counterparties that are highly rated financial institutions 
our hedging activities involve the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments 
we use derivatives only in an attempt to limit underlying exposure from currency fluctuations and to minimize earnings and cash volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes  and not for trading purposes 
our market risk on interest rates relates primarily to short term debt and the potential increase in fair value of long term debt resulting from a potential decrease in interest rates 
however  we do not have a cash flow or earnings exposure due to market risks on long term debt 
see further discussions on these market risks below 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk arising from transactions in the normal course of business  such as sales and loans to wholly owned subsidiaries as well as sales to third party customers  purchases from suppliers  and bank lines of credit with creditors denominated in foreign currencies 
because our products are manufactured or sourced primarily from the united states  a stronger us dollar generally has a negative impact on results from operations outside the united states while a weaker dollar generally has a positive effect 
our primary exchange rate exposure is with the euro  the japanese yen  the australian dollar  the canadian dollar  the british pound  and the mexican peso against the us dollar 
we enter into various contracts  principally forward contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change  to protect the value of existing foreign currency assets  liabilities  anticipated sales  and probable commitments 
decisions on whether to use such contracts are made based on the amount of exposures to the currency involved  and an assessment of the near term market value for each currency 
the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related exposures 
therefore  changes in market values of these hedge instruments are highly correlated with changes in market values of underlying hedged items both at inception of the hedge and over the life of the hedge contract 
our risk management activities for fiscal were successful in minimizing the net earnings and cash flow impact of currency fluctuations 
the following foreign currency exchange contracts held by us have maturity dates in fiscal all items are non trading and stated in us dollars 
some derivative instruments we enter into do not meet the hedging criteria of sfas no 
 therefore  changes in fair value are recorded in other income  net 
the average contracted rate  notional amount  pre tax value of derivative instruments in accumulated comprehensive loss acl  and fair value impact of derivative instruments in other income  net as of october  were as follows value in average acl fair value dollars in thousands contracted notional income impact except average contracted rate rate amount loss gain loss buy us sell australian dollar 
 buy us sell canadian dollar  buy us sell euro 
 buy us sell swiss franc buy australian dollar sell us 
 buy british pound sell us buy euro sell us 
 buy japanese yen sell us  buy mexican peso sell us  buy swiss franc sell us our net investment in foreign subsidiaries translated into us dollars is not hedged 
any changes in foreign currency exchange rates would be reflected as a foreign currency translation adjustment and would not reduce reported net earnings 
interest rate risk 
our interest rate exposure results from short term rates  primarily libor based debt from commercial banks 
we currently do not use interest rate swaps to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates 
as of october   our financial liabilities with exposure to changes in interest rates consisted mainly of million of short term debt outstanding 
assuming a hypothetical increase of one percent basis points in short term interest rates  with all other variables remaining constant including the average balance of short term debt outstanding during fiscal  interest expense would have increased million in fiscal included in long term debt is million of fixed rate debt  which is not subject to variable interest rate fluctuations 
as of october   the estimated fair value of long term debt with fixed interest rates was million compared to its carrying value of million 
the fair value is estimated by discounting the projected cash flows using the rate which similar amounts of debt could currently be borrowed 
assuming a hypothetical increase of one percent basis points in applicable interest rates  the estimated fair value of long term debt would decrease by million compared to the carrying value 
commodities 
some raw materials used in our products are exposed to commodity price changes 
we manage some of this risk by using a combination of short term and long term agreements with some vendors 
the primary commodity price exposures are with aluminum  steel  and plastic resin
