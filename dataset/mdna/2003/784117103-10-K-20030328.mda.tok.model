item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in thousands  except per share data this discussion reviews and analyzes the consolidated financial condition at december  and  the consolidated results of operations for the past three years  and other factors that may affect future financial performance 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data included in item of this report and the consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
results of operations consolidated overview our operations are organized into five business segments that offer various products and services tailored to meet the needs of particular markets 
our reportable segments are private banking and trust  investment advisors  enterprises  money managers  and investments in new businesses 
the accounting policies of our business segments are the same as those used in preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
management evaluates financial performance of our operating segments based on income from operations 
revenues and income from operations by segment for   and are as follows in thousands year ended december  private banking and trust revenues    income from operations    investment advisors revenues    income from operations    enterprises revenues    income from operations    money managers revenues    income from operations    investments in new businesses revenues    loss from operations    general and administrative loss from operations    consolidated segment totals revenues    income from operations    other income  net    income before income taxes    income taxes    net income    diluted earnings per common share 
consolidated revenues decreased million  or percent  to million in compared to  but were up million  or percent  to million in over our revenues decreased during primarily due to the loss of certain clients in our private banking and trust and enterprises segments during the latter part of revenues for reflect the full year negative impact from these lost clients whereas revenues were only moderately affected 
revenues for both comparable periods were impacted by the volatile capital markets during the past few years 
this  along with client redemptions  resulted in a reduction of our asset based fee revenues and created economic uncertainty that has slowed some buying decisions in our target markets 
despite this  we were able to generate sales to new clients and cross sales to existing clients 
new business activity was the primary driver for revenue expansion during however  the decline in the capital markets has reduced our asset based fee revenues greater than revenue increases from new sales activity during operating income was up million in  or percent  and million in  or percent  over prior year comparable periods 
operating margins also improved during the past three years  percent in  percent in  and percent in the improvement in both operating income and operating margin was primarily due to cost containment and improved productivity in both comparable periods  especially during operating income and margin during was also boosted by revenue growth 
we focused our cost containment efforts at discretionary spending  primarily marketing  consulting  and annual incentive compensation payments 
a portion of our personnel costs are paid in the form of sales commissions and non sales bonus payments that are tied to performance goals at the corporate and business unit levels 
the actual amount of bonuses to be paid for the year is a function of actual performance relative to established targets 
as a percentage of sales  incentive and sales compensation expense decreased in both comparable periods 
our cost containment efforts also extended to our investment spending 
we continued to expend significant dollars on the development of new products but sharpened our investment priorities to better focus our efforts 
our primary investments are aimed at building outsourced business solutions that are leveragable across multiple target markets 
we remain optimistic because of the recurring nature of our revenues  strong cash flow  the leverage in our operations  and our portfolio of businesses 
we will also continue to invest in the development of new products and services to expand our existing client base and penetrate new markets 
however  prolonged volatility in the capital markets  continued economic uncertainty and mergers and acquisitions in the banking industry will continue to be long term challenges 
asset balances in millions as of december  assets invested in equity and fixed income programs 
   assets invested in liquidity funds    assets under management    client proprietary assets under administration    assets under management and administration    the asset figures shown above represent assets of our clients or their customers for which we provide management and or administrative services and are not included in the accompanying balance sheets since we do not own these assets 
assets under management consist of total assets of our clients or their customers invested in our equity and fixed income investment programs and liquidity funds for which we provide asset management services 
assets under administration consist of total assets of our clients or their customers for which we provide administrative services  including client proprietary fund balances for which we provide administration and or distribution services 
private banking and trust private banking and trust provides investment processing solutions  fund processing solutions  and investment management programs to banks and other trust institutions 
investment processing services primarily include outsourcing services as an application service provider  or asp  through our trust product line and as a business services provider  or bsp  through our trust company 
trust includes integrated systems that provide a complete investment accounting and management information system for private banks and trust companies 
revenues are primarily earned from monthly processing and non recurring project fees 
fund processing solutions include administration and distribution services provided to bank proprietary mutual funds 
these services primarily include fund administration and accounting  regulatory and compliance services  shareholder recordkeeping  and marketing 
revenues are primarily earned as a percentage of average asset values of the proprietary funds 
investment management revenues are primarily earned through management fees that are based upon a percentage of the average daily net asset value of assets under management 
year ended december  revenues investment processing fees    fund processing fees    investment management fees    total revenues    expenses operating and development    sales and marketing    income from operations    operating margin percent of revenue operating and development sales and marketing total revenues for this segment were down million  or percent  in  compared with  but were up million  or percent  in over the change in revenues during both comparable periods was due to two separate factors 
the decrease in revenues was mainly due to lost clients in our fund processing business because of bank consolidations 
the increase in revenues resulted from an increase in recurring and non recurring investment processing fees from new business and cross sales to existing clients 
investment processing fees decreased percent during but increased percent in these revenues include recurring processing fees and non recurring project fees 
our recurring revenue base from our asp solution and our total outsourcing solution increased in both years  approximately million in and million in this was mostly due to some new sales and the completed conversion of existing clients involved in bank merger activity during however  a lack of new deals along with diminished bank merger activity has reduced our non recurring project fees 
non recurring project fees decreased approximately million in but increased million in fund processing fees declined in both comparable periods primarily because of client losses involved in bank mergers and the decline in the capital markets 
as a result  our assets under administration from this business dropped considerably  reducing our asset based fee revenues 
the decline in our revenues from these lost clients began in late and extended throughout most of revenues decreased approximately million in because of these lost clients 
the balance of the revenue decrease was caused mostly by the continued decline in the capital markets 
operating income was also down in but increased in whereas operating margins were up in each year 
operating income decreased million  or percent  in  compared with  but was up million  or percent  in over the decrease in operating income for was mainly because of the decline in fund processing fees  net of the decrease in direct expenses associated with these lost clients 
the increase in operating income in was primarily due to an increase in our investment processing fees described above 
an additional factor affecting operating income and margin in both comparable periods was our cost containment efforts 
we continued to be more selective about our investment spending for new product development  reduced sales and incentive compensation payments  and lower marketing expenditures 
we believe our future growth in revenues and income will come from the development of new products and services to grow existing markets and to expand into new markets 
in addition  consolidations among our bank clients continue to be a major strategic issue facing this segment 
the result could either be an increase or decrease in our client base thereby affecting revenues and earnings 
investment advisors investment advisors provides investment management programs and investment processing solutions to affluent investors through a network of independent registered investment advisors  financial planners  and other investment professionals 
revenues are primarily earned as a percentage of the average asset values under management 
year ended december  revenues    expenses operating and development    sales and marketing    income from operations    operating margin percent of revenues operating and development sales and marketing revenues were down million in  or percent  compared with but grew million in  or percent  over our revenues are primarily earned as asset based fees tied to the value of the assets we manage 
poor capital markets during the past few years have caused a devaluation in the assets we manage from existing clients 
the difficult capital markets led to an industry wide increase in mutual fund redemptions to which we were not immune 
despite the increase in our redemption rate  our sales efforts were still able to generate positive net new cash flow which helped to lessen the revenue impact of the declining capital markets 
new business activity was the primary driver for revenue growth during operating income and margins were up in each comparable period 
operating income for increased million  or percent  compared with  and increased million in  or percent  compared with operating income and margin improvement for came mostly from cost containment measures  mainly reduced incentive compensation costs and marketing expenditures 
in addition  our investment spending decreased primarily due to development expenditures made in and relating to some new products that were completed in finally  operating income and margin improvement for was mainly because of increased revenues 
the current economic environment has been difficult for both us and our clients  but we will continue to make investments in the development of new products to enhance our current product offering 
however  continued volatility in the capital markets and client redemptions could impede future growth in our revenues and earnings 
enterprises enterprises provides business solutions to pension plan sponsors  hospitals  foundations  unions  endowment funds and other institutional investors 
we also provide treasury business solutions to corporations 
revenues are primarily earned as a percentage of average asset values under management 
year ended december  revenues    expenses operating and development    sales and marketing    income from operations    operating margin percent of revenue operating and development sales and marketing revenues dropped million during  or percent  compared with but grew million in  or percent  over the primary reason for the decline in revenues was the market impact on our assets under management from declining capital markets 
also  we lost two large retirement solution clients in late we generated new client sales in of billion in assets 
revenue growth in was primarily due to new business activity 
operating income and margins were up in both comparable periods 
operating income grew million in  or percent  compared with  and increased million in over throughout  we diligently managed expenses in two discretionary areas  marketing and incentive compensation 
we also benefited from lower technology development costs 
we incurred significant technology development costs in and for our treasury trading platform 
this project was completed during operating income and margin was up because of new business activity and lower marketing costs 
pension and retirement programs have become a more visible and strategic issue facing institutions which could be a positive catalyst for increasing the level of client purchase decisions 
we believe our product offering has us well positioned once institutions return to making purchase decisions 
however  economic uncertainty coupled with continued volatility in the capital markets remains a long term challenge that could negatively affect future revenues and earnings 
money managers money managers provides investment solutions to us based investment managers  us based mutual fund companies and to investment managers worldwide of alternative asset classes eg  hedge funds and private equity funds 
revenues are primarily earned as a percentage of the average asset values of assets under management and administration 
year ended december  revenues    expenses operating and development    sales and marketing    income from operations    operating margin percent of revenue operating and development sales and marketing revenues increased in each comparable period  million in  or percent  compared with and million in  or percent  over revenue growth for the past two years came mostly from the sale of new business 
we added new clients during and new clients during most of our new business activity came from the alternative investment market 
in this market  we added new clients in and new clients in the balance of new business came from us based money managers 
in addition  revenue growth was assisted by cross sales to existing clients 
however  the volatile capital markets offset some of this growth 
operating income and margins also increased in each comparable period 
operating income increased million in  compared with and increased million in over operating income and margins were up because of increased revenues from new business 
however  the increase in revenues was not fully reflected in profitability growth because of continued investment in new product offerings and in our infrastructure 
we expect future growth will come from continued investments in new product offerings and enhancements to our existing products 
also  we expect that investments made in our infrastructure will improve productivity and increase leverage that should control expenses 
however  we expect the capital markets will remain volatile in the near term which could impede revenue and earnings growth 
in addition  we expect increased investment spending that may hold operating margins down 
investments in new businesses investments in new businesses provides investment management  fund processing  and investment processing solutions to non us banks  investment advisors  enterprises and money managers located outside the united states 
this segment also includes other initiatives in new us markets 
revenues are primarily earned as a percentage of the average asset values under management 
year ended december  revenues    expenses operating and development    sales and marketing    loss from operations    operating margin percent of revenue operating and development sales and marketing the following table displays revenues by geographic region as a percentage of total segment revenues year ended december  europe south africa canada asia other total revenues increased million during  or percent  compared with and increased million in  or percent  over the increase in revenues in both comparable periods is primarily due to new business activity despite weak capital markets globally 
most of our revenue growth came from our global institutional business in both the uk and canada as our product offering gained market acceptance 
we also had modest growth from the high net worth segment but believe this sector has slowed due to the weak capital markets 
finally  revenues in included our canadian consulting business that was sold in july revenues actually increased percent in excluding all revenues attributable to that business 
operating losses for each year include significant investments in technology  our dublin based operations and sales and marketing in europe 
operating losses and margin improvement during were affected by increased revenues  a sharpening of our investment spending  and some cost containment measures 
in addition  we reduced or eliminated some of our latin america initiatives in late and early because these operations no longer fit into our strategy of global expansion 
we expect continued investment during  both in our global expansion and other new business initiatives 
we will continue to build our distribution network and remain optimistic about the long term prospects for our global business initiatives but expect to incur losses throughout general administrative year ended december  general and administrative expenses    percent of revenue general and administrative expense includes corporate overhead costs and other costs not directly attributable to any of our business segments 
the change in general and administrative expenses for each comparable period was due to fluctuations in various corporate overhead costs 
other income other income consists of the following year ended december  equity in the earnings of unconsolidated affiliate    net loss from investments  interest income    interest expense    total other income  net    equity in the earnings of unconsolidated affiliate includes our less than percent ownership in lsv asset management  or lsv  general partnership see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the increase in the net earnings of lsv was due to an increase in assets under management and an increase in performance based fees in and net loss on investments includes a gain of million from hedge ineffectiveness  a charge of million for other than temporary declines in market value  and 
million in realized losses from marketable securities see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
interest income is earned based upon the amount of cash that is invested daily and fluctuations in interest income recognized for one period in relation to another is due to changes in the average cash balances invested for the period and or changes in interest rates 
interest income was down in from lower interest rates and a decrease in our average cash balances 
interest income was up in from a higher average daily cash balance net of lower interest rates than in our interest expense is directly attributable to our long term debt and other borrowings 
interest expense fluctuations result from debt transactions or changes in interest rates 
income taxes our effective tax rate was percent in  percent in  and percent in the rate reduction in  compared with  was largely due to effective state and international tax planning 
liquidity and capital resources year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities    net cash used in investing activities    net cash used in financing activities    net increase in cash and cash equivalents    cash and cash equivalents  beginning of year 
   cash and cash equivalents  end of year    cash requirements and liquidity needs are expected to be funded through our cash flow from operations and our capacity for additional borrowing 
we currently have a line of credit agreement that provides for borrowings of up to million 
the availability of the line of credit is subject to compliance with certain covenants set forth in the agreement see note to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   our unused sources of liquidity consisted of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of million and the unused portion of the line of credit of million 
net cash provided by operating activities grew million in and million in from the prior comparable years primarily from an increase in income and favorable working capital trends 
this was due to improved productivity and lower discretionary costs  such as compensation and marketing 
however  net cash from operating activities in only improved slightly from last year because of the reduced tax benefit received from stock option exercises 
capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment  including capitalized software development costs  were million in  million in  and million in our capital expenditures are primarily for the expansion of our corporate headquarters 
during  we completed construction on one building and a parking structure

this project should be completed by mid with a total expected cost of approximately million

critical accounting policies in  the securities and exchange commission  or sec  issued a statement addressing selection and disclosure by public companies of critical accounting policies and practices 
the sec encouraged inclusion in management s discussion and analysis commentary as to the likelihood of materially different reported results if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail in the application of these critical accounting policies 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements and supplementary information were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
inherent in the application of many of these accounting policies is the need for management to make estimates and judgements in the determination of certain revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities 
materially different financial results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known 
we believe that the following accounting policies require extensive judgement by our management to determine the recognition and timing of amounts recorded in our financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized in the periods in which they are performed 
cash received by us in advance of the performance of services is deferred and recognized as revenue when earned 
our principal sources of revenues are information processing and software servicing fees that are recurring in nature and earned based on the number of trust accounts being serviced and non recurring project fees that are determined upon contractual agreements  and management  administration and distribution fees that are based upon a percentage of the average daily net asset value of assets under management or administration 
the majority of our revenues are based on contractual arrangements and do not require judgement by management 
certain portions of our revenues do require management s consideration to determine the amount and timing of recognition 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of some of our clients to make their scheduled payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is primarily based upon an aging analysis of the total outstanding receivables balance at each balance sheet date 
other factors are considered in determining the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts  such as historical trends  the financial condition of our clients and other factors that may be deemed appropriate 
based upon this analysis  the allowance for doubtful accounts is adjusted to an amount that is sufficient to cover expected losses from doubtful accounts 
investments available for sale we value our investments in marketable securities based on quoted market prices 
we review our investments in marketable securities on a quarterly basis with regards to impairment 
factors considered in determining other than temporary impairment are significant or prolonged declines in the fair value of our investments  our ability and intent to retain the investment for a period sufficient to allow the value to recover and the financial condition of the investment 
after considering these factors  if we believe that a decline is other than temporary  the carrying value of the investment is written down to its fair value through current period earnings 
computer software development costs we utilize internally developed computer software as part of our product offering 
in the development of a new software product  considerable consideration must be made by management to determine whether costs incurred are research and development costs or production costs to be capitalized 
management must consider a number of different factors during their evaluation of each computer software development project that include estimates and assumptions 
costs considered to be research and development are expensed as incurred 
after meeting certain requirements  production costs are capitalized as incurred 
the recoverability of computer software development costs capitalized requires considerable judgement by management which includes  but is not limited to  an evaluation of expected future revenues and cash flows  acceptability of the product in the market  the ability to support the product in a cost effective manner  technological enhancements and any other factor deemed appropriate 
if management determines that certain software products are considered either obsolete or incapable of producing sustainable future cash flows  an impairment charge would be required 
the amount of the impairment charge would be based on estimates of the software s fair value compared to its book value 
income tax accounting the computation of our income tax expense requires the interpretation of complex tax laws and regulations in many taxing jurisdictions around the world 
actual income tax expense can differ significantly from our estimates 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we assess the recoverability of deferred tax assets based upon our estimated future taxable income and our tax strategies 
we also recognize a liability for expected future tax contingencies 
we assess the liability based on our review of various tax issues and interpretations of tax law 
differences between our estimates and actual results could have a significant impact to our consolidated results of operations  financial position  or liquidity 
the assessment of critical accounting policies is not meant to be an all inclusive discussion of the uncertainties to financial results that can occur from the application of the full range of our accounting policies 
materially different financial results could occur in the application of other accounting policies as well 
also  materially different results can occur upon the adoption of new accounting standards 
new accounting pronouncements see the discussion of new accounting pronouncements in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
forward looking statements certain statements contained in this discussion may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements are based upon estimates and assumptions that involve risks  uncertainties  and other factors  many of which are beyond our control  that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expected results 
we have no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  except as required by law 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to changes in interest rates primarily relates to our investment portfolio and long term debt obligations 
our excess cash is principally invested in short term  highly liquid financial instruments  mainly money market funds  with a substantial proportion of such investments having initial maturities of three months or less 
our investment portfolio also includes some long term fixed income mutual funds  principally invested in federal government agency securities 
we place our investments in financial instruments that meet high credit quality standards 
a portion of our long term debt is based upon a variable rate which renews every three months 
while changes in interest rates could decrease interest income or increase interest expense  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to changes in interest rates 
we do not undertake any specific actions to cover our exposure to interest rate risk and are not a party to any interest rate risk management transactions 
concentration of credit risk financial instruments which potentially expose us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents  marketable securities and trade receivables 
cash equivalents are principally invested in short term money market funds or placed with major banks and high credit qualified financial institutions 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to our receivables are limited due to the large number of clients and their dispersion across geographic areas 
no single group or customer represents greater than percent of total accounts receivable 
foreign currency risk we transact business in the local currencies of various foreign countries  principally canada  europe and asia 
the total of all of our foreign operations only accounts for approximately percent of total consolidated revenues 
also  most of our foreign operations match local currency revenues with local currency costs 
due to these reasons  we do not hedge against foreign operations nor do we expect any material loss with respect to foreign currency risk 
price risk we are exposed to price risk associated with changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio 
to provide some protection against potential fair value changes for some of these investments  we have entered into various derivative financial instruments 
we currently hold derivative financial instruments with a notional amount of million with various terms  generally less than one year 
the effectiveness of these hedging relationships is evaluated on a retrospective and prospective basis using quantitative measures of correlation 
if a hedge is ineffective  any excess gains or losses attributable to such ineffectiveness are recognized in current period earnings 
during  we did not enter into or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
during  we recorded a million impairment charge related to other than temporary declines in the fair value of certain securities held within our investment portfolio 
also  the amount of hedge ineffectiveness that was charged to current period earnings was a gain of million 
the aggregate effect of a hypothetical percent change in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments would not be material to our results of operations  financial position  or liquidity 
a significant portion of our revenues are based upon the market value of assets we manage or administer 
a decline in the market value of these assets as a result of changes in market conditions  the general economy or other factors will negatively impact our revenues and earnings
