general the following is a discussion of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the company and notes thereto 
the exploration company is an independent oil and gas enterprise with interests primarily in the maverick basin in southwest texas 
its long term business strategy is to acquire undeveloped mineral interests and internally develop a multi year drilling inventory through the use of advanced technologies  such as d seismic and horizontal drilling 
the company accounts for its oil and gas operations under the successful efforts method of accounting and trades its common stock on the nasdaq stock market sm under the symbol txco 
the company currently has six drilling rigs under operation on its extensive  acreage block in the maverick basin  targeting at least seven separate formations for the production of oil and natural gas 
capital resources and liquidity year ended december  during beginning cash reserves of million were increased by net cash provided from operating activities of million resulting in a total of million in internally generated working capital for use in funding ongoing expansion  development and exploration of the company s oil and gas properties 
additionally  cash of million from other sources listed below resulted in total cash of million available for use in meeting the company s ongoing operational and development needs 
included in the million cash received from other sources  is approximately million from a private placement of  shares of restricted common stock at a price of per share to a group of institutional investors 
the amount raised  net of offering costs of million  was used for acquisitions  to accelerate the development of the company s extensive maverick basin acreage holdings and for general corporate purposes 
pursuant to the placement agreement  the company filed a form s registration statement dated june   covering the issued shares on behalf of the investors 
cash available to the company beginning cash reserves  january  net cash provided by operating activities sub total private placement of  shares of common stock borrowings on the new credit facility other debt obligations exercise of outstanding options for the company s common stock proceeds from sale of oil and gas properties total other sources of cash cash available the company applied million of its working capital to fund the expansion and ongoing development of its oil and gas properties 
included were drilling  completion  seismic and acquisition costs totaling million  primarily targeting txco s core area  the maverick basin 
this represented expenditures for the drilling  completion and re entry of oil and gas wells and the acquisition of maverick basin mineral leases 
in addition  the company acquired a mile pipeline system 
the pipeline system has and continues to gather most of the company s natural gas in the maverick basin 
the following table summarizes uses of cash during uses of cash drilling and completion costs  d seismic  and leasehold acquisitions natural gas pipeline and facilities pena creek acquisition and improvements well service equipment upgrade information system and related infrastructure other sub total net distributions to minority interests debt principal payments the company made timely payments of  on its long term debt obligations during  while payments on interest totaled  acquisition pipelines in may  the company completed the acquisition of the maverick pipeline system from aquila southwest pipeline corporation for a total purchase price of million 
txco s initial interest million was purchased through its newly formed maverick dimmit pipeline  ltd 
partnership the partnership 
the remaining of the partnership was held by an unaffiliated private energy concern 
this acquisition was funded with proceeds from a million private placement also closed in may 
in june  the partnership acquired an additional miles of pipeline from txco s owned subsidiary  the paloma pipeline lp for million 
during the third quarter  the partnership began construction of a mile   pipeline extension to connect the company s growing chittim lease production to the pipeline system 
this extension was placed in service early in the fourth quarter 
during the fourth quarter  txco consolidated its position by acquiring the outstanding minority interest in maverick dimmit pipeline  ltd  at its book value of million 
the consolidation was funded through txco s available credit facility 
acquisition pena creek also in may  the company acquired the pena creek oil field in dimmit county  texas from merit energy company for million 
the purchase was effective april  the acquisition consisted of producing oil wells  injection wells and shut in wells 
as a result of these activities  the company ended the year with a negative working capital of  and a current ratio of 
to this year end position compares to negative working capital of  and a current ratio of 
to at december  the company ended with an unused borrowing base of million 
the company s ending working capital for years ended and was significantly impacted by the high level of drilling activity during the two year period 
bank credit facility on march  the company entered into a million oil and gas reserve based revolving credit facility with hibernia national bank providing a credit line with an initial borrowing base set at million 
the borrowing base was subsequently increased to million as of september   with quarterly reductions of million 
at december   the borrowing base was million with an outstanding balance of million  resulting in an unused borrowing base of million 
the unused borrowing base at march   was million 
interest is payable monthly  with principal due at maturity in march uses of proceeds are for the acquisition and development of oil and gas properties and general corporate working capital purposes 
the facility provides the lender with semiannual scheduled redeterminations  at mid year and each subsequent anniversary date  while providing for two unscheduled redeterminations per year  at the company s discretion 
borrowings under the facility are secured by a first priority mortgage covering the company s working and other interests in the majority of its oil and gas leases 
the interest rate under the facility will initially be based on the wall street journal prime rate plus applicable margin 
a eurodollar rate plus applicable margin may be utilized at the election of the company 
the interest rate at december   was  and the rate was unchanged at march  the facility also provides the lender with a commitment fee equal to  per annum on the unused borrowing base 
the facility contains certain financial covenants and other negative restrictions common for a financing of this type 
any unused borrowing base is a net increase to working capital for purposes of the current ratio covenant 
management believes that the facility  along with the company s positive cash flow from existing production and anticipated production increases from new drilling  will provide adequate capital to fund ongoing operating cash requirements for and to complete its scheduled exploration and development goals as targeted by its capital expenditure program 
however  there is no assurance that the company will re establish profitability in nor that expected increases in new oil and natural gas production will be realized  nor that sufficient debt capital will remain available from its new borrowing facility 
should these concerns be realized or should commodity prices weaken significantly  the company s financial condition could be adversely affected and could cause the company to defer planned capital expenditures consistent with its available capital resources 
year ended december  during beginning cash reserves were increased by net cash provided from operating activities resulting in a total of million in internally generated working capital  and million from other sources  listed below  for a total of million in cash available for use in funding the ongoing expansion  development and exploration of the company s oil and gas properties 
cash available to the company beginning cash reserves  january  net cash provided by operating activities sub total other debt obligations exercise of outstanding options for the company s common stock sale of oil and gas properties total other sources of cash cash available the company applied million of its working capital to fund the expansion and ongoing development of its oil and gas properties 
included were drilling  completions  seismic and leasehold acquisition costs totaling million primarily targeting txco s core area  the maverick basin 
this represented expenditures for the drilling  completion and re entry of oil and gas wells and new maverick basin mineral lease purchases of approximately  acres 
also included were expenditures for the expansion of the company s paloma lease gas gathering facilities and for vehicles and other equipment used in the field 
uses of cash drilling and completion costs  d seismic  and leasehold acquisitions expansion of natural gas gathering facilities other property and equipment other sub total purchase of  shares of treasury stock debt principal payments net distributions to minority interests the company made timely payments of  on its long term debt obligations during  while payments on interest totaled  additionally  the company purchased  shares of its common stock for its treasury at a cost of  under its common share buyback program approved by the board of directors on june  as a result of these activities  the company ended the year with a negative working capital of  and a current ratio of 
to this year end position compares to positive working capital of  and a current ratio of to at december  the decrease in ending working capital was attributable to the increased levels of development activities through the third quarter coupled with the sharp decline in realized gas prices during the second half of capital requirements the major components of the company s plans  and the requirements for additional capital for  include the following maverick basin activity initial capital expenditures planned for total over million and target the company s maverick basin core properties 
the primary component of these expenditures is million for drilling wells  while over million is earmarked for seismic and leasehold and gas gathering system enhancements and other infrastructure expansion activities 
the company s budgeted capital expenditures are intended to be flexible 
overall budgeted capital outlays are subject to substantial increase should the company s key exploration targets  development activities or special situations or opportunities warrant higher capital outlays than originally planned 
the company initially plans to drill wells  including glen rose porosity zone oil wells  glen rose shoal horizontal gas wells  georgetown gas wells  san miguel waterflood oil wells in the pena creek field  and shallow escondido gas wells 
some of these wells will be operated by other companies and  therefore  txco does not have direct control over when they will be drilled or what final costs will actually be incurred 
the following table details typical gross well costs for budgeted wells 
typical gross well costs dry hole completed glen rose oil porosity zone well glen rose shoal gas well georgetown gas well san miguel waterflood oil well escondido gas well williston basin activity the company plans to maintain its existing producing properties and the payment of delay rentals and lease extensions on selected undeveloped leases  with scheduled delay rentals of  and will continue in its efforts to offer remaining acreage  seismic data  and identified prospects to other industry operators 
summary of capital resources and liquidity the company expects it will have a continuing ability to further increase its borrowing base commensurate with the expected additional growth of its proved oil and gas reserves throughout the base term of the new facility 
management remains confident that financial resources will remain available  enabling the company to continue the rapid development of its oil and gas properties and continue to meet its normal operational and debt service obligations on a timely basis 
while management is confident it has identified sufficient sources of working capital to carry out its current exploration and development plans on its texas leaseholds  as well as to meet its obligations in the ordinary course of business through the end of the coming year  there is no assurance that energy prices or other market factors will continue to improve 
should prices weaken  or should expected new oil and gas production levels from planned drilling not be attained  the resulting reduction in projected revenues would cause the company to re evaluate its expected sources of working capital and would adversely affect the company s ability to carry out its current operating plans 
results of operations compared to the company reported a net loss of  or per basic and diluted share for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of  or per basic and diluted share for the prior year 
revenues for increased by compared to oil production increased by while natural gas production declined by as compared with the prior year 
the increase in oil production is due to the new comanche lease oil wells  along with production from the may acquisition of the pena creek field 
the decline in gas production compared to the prior year reflects the general production decline of the company s existing mix of maturing gas wells 
this decline was partially offset by new gas production from the new gas wells drilled and completed during the year 
included in the number of gas wells classified as producing at december   were cbm gas wells  which are still in their initial dewatering stage  and are not yet contributing a significant amount of new gas production 
on an equivalent unit basis  prices averaged lower in as compared to crude oil prices averaged higher while natural gas prices fell 
average lowe r prices for  as compared to  had a million negative impact on revenues in commodity prices have been and continue to be volatile 
during  realized gas prices ranged from over per mcf in january to a low of per mcf in october 
during realized natural gas prices ranged from over per mcf in november to a low of in february 
during the first three months of crude oil and natural gas prices have increased significantly 
average daily net gas production rates in decreased to mmcf  a decline from the prior year  while average daily net oil production rates in increased to bbls  a over the prior year 
the company expects to reverse the declining natural gas production rates based on its year drilling success to date and expected results from ongoing drilling projects 
lease operating expense for increased million  from million in to million in  a increase 
this increase is primarily due to the addition of new natural gas wells and new oil wells during and the acquisition of active pena creek wells 
the increase reflects the incremental direct costs of operating the new wells  including typical costs such as pumper  electricity  water disposal  and other direct overhead charges  as added during to the company s existing lease operating expense levels 
operating expense per mcfe increased  from in to in the increase in the rate is due to the pena creek field  which consists of three waterflood units 
typically  waterfloods incur higher costs of operations 
excluding the pena creek field  operating expense per mcfe for is  a decrease of from the prior year 
also  included in operating costs is the cost of operating the cbm wells 
these costs to taled  in and  in the cbm wells are in the dewatering phase and therefore have little production relative to their operating costs 
operating cost per mcfe excluding the cbm wells and pena creek averaged in and in pursuant to the successful efforts method of accounting for mineral properties  the company periodically assesses its producing and non producing properties for impairment 
impairment and abandonments decreased by primarily due to lower impairment rates on non producing acreage in the williston basin during versus depreciation  depletion and amortization increased by almost million  or  over due primarily to the increased number of producing wells being depleted for wells added through the drill bit and the pena creek acquisition 
the increase in depreciation was due to increased investments in other equipment including the pipeline and well service equipment acquisitions 
the increase in amortization was primarily due to the full year amortization related to the d seismic survey on the comanche lease acquired during general and administrative costs increased compared to reflecting the higher sustained level of company operations 
the increase is due primarily to increased salaries  wages and benefits associated with staff increases including engineering and administrative staff additions and new field personnel during also contributing to the increase were higher costs for property and liability insurance and increased investor relations expenses 
the decrease in interest income reflects the declining cash levels in interest bearing accounts and declining interest rates during versus interest expense increased by  in from due to higher debt levels 
compared to the company reported a net loss of  or per basic and diluted share for the year ended december   compared to net income of  or per basic and diluted share for the prior year 
net income in included a deferred tax benefit of  while no similar benefit was recognized in although  revenues decreased by compared to year levels  oil and gas production declined by and respectively as compared with the decline in oil production primarily reflects the advancing decline curve of maturing oil wells in the williston basin 
in addition  a decline in the average price of oil was offset somewhat by an increase in the average price of gas as compared to prices for both commodities 
the decline in gas production compared to the prior year reflects the general production decline of the company s existing mix of maturing gas wells 
this decline was partially offset by new gas production from the new gas wells drilled and completed during included in the number of gas wells classified as producing in were cbm gas wells  which were still in their initial dewatering stage and not yet contributing a significant amount of new gas production 
a significant contribution of new cbm gas production is expected from these wells upon their reaching phase of the dewatering process 
average daily net gas production rates in decreased to mmcf  an decline over the prior year  while average daily net oil production rates in decreased to bbls  a decline over the prior year 
lease operations expense for increased compared to this increase was primarily due to the addition of new gas wells and new oil wells during the increase reflects the incremental direct costs of operating the new wells  including typical costs such as pumper  electricity  water disposal  and other direct overhead charges  as added during to the company s existing lease operating expense levels 
the new burr wells increased overall annual lease operating costs by approximately  due to the higher costs of chemical treatment for h s removal and related costs of operating an amine plant for these gas wells plus costs associated with salt water disposal 
the newly connected cbm wells in the dewatering pilot project added  in incremental operating costs in and reflect the high operating costs associated with the de watering phase of the cbm pilot program initiated in addit ionally  ad valorem taxes increased approximately in compared to reflecting increased appraised values for new oil and gas properties as well as increased valuations of exiting wells due to higher oil and gas prices over the prior year 
exploration expenses remained consistent with pursuant to the successful efforts method of accounting for mineral properties  the company periodically assesses its producing and non producing properties for impairment 
impairment and abandonment decreased by primarily due to lower impairment rates on non producing acreage in the williston basin during versus this decrease was somewhat offset by an increase in impairments of producing properties resulting from lower oil and gas prices at year end and the resultant decreased property values in the year end reserve report 
depreciation  depletion and amortization increased by almost  or over calendar levels due primarily to the increased number of producing wells being depleted and higher depletion rates for caused by lower year end reserve volumes as a result of lower oil and gas prices at december  the increase in depreciation was due to increased investments in other equipment including the expansion of the paloma lease ga thering system throughout the year 
the increase in amortization was primarily due to the additional amortization related to the square mile d seismic survey on the comanche lease acquired during general and administrative costs increased compared to reflecting the higher sustained level of company operations 
of the increase was due primarily to increased salaries  wages and benefits associated with staff increases including engineering and administrative staff additions and new field personnel during also contributing to the increase were higher costs for property and liability insurance  increased accounting and auditing fees and increased state franchise tax expenses 
the decrease in interest income reflects the declining cash levels in interest bearing accounts and declining interest rates during versus interest expense decreased by  in from due to the retirement of the range debt during the second quarter of income tax expensed decreased by  due to the recognition of a deferred federal tax benefit of  in  while no similar benefit was recognized in contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments the following is a summary of the company s future payments on obligations as of december  payments due by period after contractual obligations year years years years total long term debt operating lease obligations total contractual cash obligations in addition to the above  in january the company entered into a million unsecured installment obligation 
imputed interest due on the obligation is per annum 
payments are due in two equal installments million in january and january in january the company entered into a contract to deliver natural gas at a fixed price 
the volumes to be delivered under the contract are as follows commitment by period after fixed price contract year years years years total natural gas volume  mmbtu fixed price per mmbtu approximately  mmbtu per day for the period february  through december  net of transportation and marketing costs 
the volumes to be delivered under the contract represented approximately of the company s natural gas production rate at december  the company expects to be able to delivery the committed volumes from its maverick basin production 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations is based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
our significant accounting policies are described in note a to our consolidated financial statements 
in response to sec release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we have identified certain of these policies as being of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and which require the application of significant judgment by management 
we analyze our estimates  including those related to oil and gas revenues  oil and gas properties  income taxes  contingencies and litigation  an d base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s financial statements successful efforts method of accounting the company accounts for its natural gas and crude oil exploration and development activities utilizing the successful efforts method of accounting 
under this method  costs of productive exploratory wells  development dry holes and productive wells  costs to acquire mineral interests and d seismic costs are capitalized 
exploration costs  including personnel costs  certain geological and geophysical expenses including d seismic costs and delay rentals for oil and gas leases  are charged to expense as incurred 
exploratory drilling costs are initially capitalized  but charged to expense if and when the well is determined not to have found reserves in commercial quantities 
the sale of a partial interest in a proved property is accounted for as a cost recovery and no gain or loss is recognized 
the application of the successful efforts method of accounting requires managerial judgment to determine the proper classification of wells designated as developmental or exploratory which will ultimately determine the proper accounting treatment of the costs incurred 
the results from a drilling operation can take considerable time to analyze and the determination that commercial reserves have been discovered requires both judgment and industry experience 
wells may be completed that are assumed to be productive and actually deliver oil and gas in quantities insufficient to be economic  which may result in the abandonment of the wells at a later date 
wells are drilled that have targeted geologic structures that are both developmental and exploratory in nature and an allocation of costs is required to properly account for the results 
the evaluation of oil and gas leasehold acquisition costs requires managerial judgment to estimate the fair value of these costs with referenc e to drilling activity in a given area 
drilling activities in an area by other companies may also effectively condemn leasehold positions 
the successful efforts method of accounting can have a significant impact on the operational results reported when the company is entering a new exploratory area in hopes of finding an oil and gas field that will be the focus of future development drilling activity 
the initial exploratory wells may be unsuccessful and will be expensed 
reserve estimates the company s estimates of oil and gas reserves  by necessity  are projections based on geologic and engineering data  and there are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of such data as well as the projection of future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that are difficult to measure 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
estimates of economically recoverable oil and gas reserves and future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  such as historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies and assumptions governing future oil and gas prices  future operating costs  severance taxes  development costs and w orkover gas costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
the future drilling costs associated with reserves assigned to proved undeveloped locations may ultimately increase to an extent that these reserves may be later determined to be uneconomic 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of oil and gas attributable to any particular group of properties  classifications of such reserves based on risk of recovery  and estimates of the future net cash flows expected therefrom may vary substantially 
any significant variance in the assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of the reserves  which could affect the carrying value of the company s oil and gas properties and or the rate of depletion of the oil and gas properties 
actual production  revenues and expenditures  with respect to the company s reserves  will likely vary from estimates and such variances may be material 
impairment of oil and gas properties the company reviews its oil and gas properties for impairment at least annually and whenever events and circumstances indicate a decline in the recoverability of their carrying value 
the company estimates the expected future cash flows of its oil and gas properties and compares such future cash flows to the carrying amount of the properties to determine if the carrying amount is recoverable 
if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows  the company will adjust the carrying amount of the oil and gas properties to their fair value 
the factors used to determine fair value include  but are not limited to  estimates of proved reserves  future commodity pricing  future production estimates  anticipated capital expenditures  and a discount rate commensurate with the risk associated with realizing the expected cash flows projected 
given the complexities associated with oil and gas reserve estimates and the history of price volatility in the oil and gas markets  events may arise that would require the company to record an impairment of the recorded book values associated with oil and gas properties 
the company has recognized impairments in prior years and there can be no assurance that impairments will not be required in the future

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk the company s major market risk exposure is the commodity pricing applicable to its oil and natural gas production 
realized commodity prices received for such production are primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices applicable to natural gas 
prices have fluctuated significantly over the last five years and such volatility is expected to continue  and the range of such price movement is not predictable with any degree of certainty 
during january the company entered into a forward sale of approximately  mmbtu per day of its natural gas production from february   through december   at a fixed price of per mmbtu 
this represents approximately of the company s net natural gas sales as of year end a fluctuation in the price received for oil and gas production would have an approximate million impact on the company s annual revenues based on sales volumes  and a million impact had the  mmbtu per day forward sales been in effect for the entire year of interest rate risk the company has borrowed funds under a new revolving credit facility with hibernia national bank  with interest tied to the wall street journal prime rate 
at march  the company had million in borrowings under the facility with interest at per annum 
under terms of the facility  the company has the option to lock in a fixed interest rate for a period of up to months using libor rates plus an applicable margin 
should interest rates start to rise  the company can convert its outstanding loan balance to the libor option rate within days of its election 
an annualized fluctuation in interest charged on the outstanding balance at march  would have an approximate  impact on the company s annual net income 
financial instruments the company s financial instruments consist of cash equivalents and accounts receivable 
its cash equivalents are cash investment funds which are placed with a major financial institution 
substantially all of the company s accounts receivable result from oil and gas sales or joint interest billings to third parties in the oil and natural gas industry 
this concentration of customers and joint interest owners may impact the company s overall credit risk in that these entities may be similarly affected by changes in economic and other conditions 
historically  the company has not experienced any significant credit losses on such receivables
