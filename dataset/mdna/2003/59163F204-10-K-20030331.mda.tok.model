results of operations for the periods discussed below should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected in any future period and fluctuations in operating results may also result in fluctuations in the market price of our common stock 
our quarterly and annual operating results have in the past and may in the future vary significantly depending on factors such as changes in the telecommunications market  the addition or expiration of customer contracts  increased competition  changes in pricing policies by us or our competitors  lengthy sales cycles  lack of market acceptance or delays in the introduction of new versions of our products or features  the cost and success of new growth strategies  the timing of the initiation of wireless or other telecommunications services though new delivery systems or their acceptance by customers  the timing and expense of the expansion or contraction of our national call center network  the general employment environment  general economic conditions and the other factors discussed under the heading issues and uncertainties in this item overview we are a leading developer and provider of enhanced directory assistance and information services for the telecommunications industry 
we primarily contract with wireless carriers to provide these services to their subscribers 
under our contracts  carriers agree to route some or all of their directory assistance and or alphanumeric messaging calls to us 
we also offer our services to multiple carriers within the same market 
when a carrier s subscribers dial a typical directory assistance number  such as  or  the calls are answered by our operators identifying the service by that carrier s brand name  such as at t wireless connect  or nextel we intend to provide services to additional carriers  businesses  governmental units and callers in general through alternate strategies intended to attract calls  information queries and other transactions 
each carrier customer establishes its own directory assistance fee structure for its subscribers 
wireless subscribers typically pay fees ranging from to plus airtime charges for our services 
we bear no subscriber collection risk with respect to carrier subscribers  however  there may be collection risk to the extent growth and profitability in the telecommunications industry decreases and to the extent we provide services to other types of customers  including businesses  governmental units or callers attracted through other means or affiliations 
we charge our carrier customers directly on a per call basis  with prices varying in some cases based on call volume 
in order to encourage our carrier customers to route more of their calls to us  our long term strategy has been based in part on reducing the price we charge our carrier customers 
we expect that average revenue per call may continue to decrease over time  as we believe this pricing strategy better positions us to retain and expand service with existing carrier customers  where profitable  and to attract new carrier customers and to achieve greater operating margins over time 
prices for services provided to other types of customers  including businesses  governmental units or other callers  may vary based on the nature of the service  volume and other circumstances 
in  we expect to continue to expand or otherwise adjust capacities in order to address varying business circumstances  including changes in volume demands and execution of our long term business strategy 
capacity needs could vary significantly as a result of additional volume from existing customers in the form of new markets  increased usage within existing markets served  changes in the carrier customers and or the number of calls routed to us or as a result of new product initiatives and growth strategies 
we will also continue to opportunistically pursue additional significant new business 
call center and network expansion efforts are intended to increase our local service coverage and our capacity to process additional call volume 
significant events our contract with sprint pcs expired on december  in october  sprint pcs indicated to us that it would not be signing a new contract upon expiration of the existing contract 
sprint pcs accounted for approximately and  of our revenues in and  respectively 
in december  we agreed to a transition arrangement with sprint pcs  pursuant to which we will continue to handle its subscribers calls subsequent to december  with different phase out periods for different markets and a complete transition by the middle of the phase out periods are governed by a mutually agreed upon schedule  however  given uncertainties beyond our control and knowledge  we are unable to predict the exact timing of the sprint pcs transition 
it is likely that the expiration of the sprint pcs contract will have an adverse effect on our financial position and future operating results  as well as our operations  although it is not possible to determine the exact timing  nature or magnitude at this time 
in may  our contract with cingular wireless expired 
we continued to serve cingular wireless customers in its california  nevada and washington markets subsequent to the contract expiration while we attempted to secure a new contract or extension of the existing one 
cingular wireless subsequently notified us that they would not be extending the existing contract or signing a new one 
cingular wireless accounted for approximately of our revenues in and approximately in service to cingular wireless customers ceased during october in february  we completed a transaction with sonera media holding b 
v 
sonera  at that time a wholly owned subsidiary of sonera corporation of helsinki  finland  whereby sonera purchased six million newly issued shares of our common stock at a price of per share  for an aggregate price of million and an approximate ownership position at that time 
a portion of the proceeds from this transaction was used to pay off all outstanding debt 
in august  the shares were transferred to sonera holding bv  another wholly owned subsidiary of sonera corporation 
in december  sonera merged with telia ab to form teliasonera ab  which is a leading mobile operator and fixed voice and data provider in scandinavia 
in february  we acquired enthusiasm technologies  inc  a developer of web based data extraction and processing technology for a combination of cash and stock 
this group builds application specific databases for a variety of portals  be they wired or wireless  voice or data 
our proprietary data extraction and processing technology enables the creation and ongoing maintenance of high quality databases from distributed and fragmented data on the web and elsewhere 
these capabilities contribute to the expansion of our services and data offerings to our wireless and other customers 
the purchase price in this transaction was not material to our financial position

we have no outstanding debt 
working capital was million at december   compared to million at december  this increase was primarily due to working capital generated from operations  offset by the use of working capital for capital expenditures

net cash provided by financing activities was million in resulting primarily from borrowings under credit facilities and the receipt of cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options and from employee stock purchases  offset by the repayment of debt obligations 
future capital needs and resources 
the primary uses of our capital in the near future are expected to be the development or acquisition of technologies  features and content complementary to our business and the potential expansion of our call center network and its capacity to serve existing and potential new customers and for general corporate purposes 
these general corporate purposes include possible acquisitions  efforts to pursue and market new growth strategies and other corporate development activities and working capital 
we intend to expand or otherwise adjust our capacity in order to address varying business circumstances  including changes in volume demands and execution of our long term business strategy 
we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and cash from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months 
although cash on hand including restricted cash at december  was approximately million  future activities  including execution of new product initiatives and growth strategies  expanded marketing and new product development and rollout may reduce available cash 
in such event  we will attempt to establish borrowing arrangements in order to maintain adequate liquidity 
we believe we will have access to future financing sources  although we cannot provide assurance that funding will be available in amounts or on terms agreeable to us 
commitments 
we generally lease our facilities through non cancelable operating leases extending for up to ten years 
minimum annual rental payments on leases for the five years subsequent to and in the aggregate thereafter are as follows year ending december  annual lease payments in thousands thereafter total minimum lease payments from time to time  in the normal course of our business  we issue standby letters of credit and bank guarantees 
at december   we had one letter of credit outstanding in the amount of million related to our workers compensation insurance program 
the letter of credit is secured by a certificate of deposit for the same amount 
this commitment expires on april  and is typically renewed on an annual basis 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  these commitments are not reflected in our balance sheets 
effect of inflation inflation did not materially affect our business during the last several years 
critical accounting policies we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
management believes that of our significant accounting policies see note to the financial statements  those governing accounts receivable  the lives and recoverability of the carrying amount of equipment and other long lived assets  such as existing intangibles and goodwill  estimates involving the levels of our contingent liabilities for workers compensation and medical self insurance and estimates of current and deferred taxes owed may involve a higher degree of judgment  estimation and uncertainty 
accounts receivable 
our customer base consists mostly of large wireless telephone carriers in the united states 
as such  management believes we have minimal risk of uncollectability  at any point in time  related to outstanding accounts receivable 
we have not experienced significant collection issues or write offs related to these customers 
consequently  we do not maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts 
since our accounts receivable are concentrated in relatively few customers  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers could adversely impact collection of our accounts receivable and therefore have a material adverse effect on our financial position and future operating results 
long lived assets and goodwill 
we evaluate the remaining life and recoverability of equipment and other assets  including patents and trademarks and internally developed software  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
at such time  we estimate the future cash flows expected upon eventual disposition and  if lower than the carrying amount  adjust the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value 
purchased goodwill  which represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination  was amortized on a straight line basis  over the estimated economic life  through december  as discussed below under recent accounting pronouncements  we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  as of january  under sfas no 
 we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable 
we perform our annual impairment test in november each year 
to perform that test  we compare the carrying value of our business to our estimates of the fair value of our business 
if our evaluation indicates that the fair value of our business is less than its carrying value  we will write down the related goodwill to its implied fair value 
we use estimates of future cash flows  discounted to present value  market prices and other measures to estimate the fair value of our business 
it is reasonably possible that our estimates of future cash flows  discount rates and other assumptions inherent in the calculation of the estimated fair value of our business will change in the future  which could cause us to write down goodwill at that time 
self insurance reserves 
we self insure a portion of our workers compensation and employee medical insurance programs 
we purchase stop loss coverage at varying levels in order to mitigate our potential future losses 
the nature of these liabilities  which may not fully manifest themselves for several years  requires significant judgment 
we evaluate pending workers compensation and medical claims periodically to determine the reasonableness of the reserves we have recorded for such claims 
our evaluation includes estimates of potential incurred but unreported claims as well as factors that may cause original estimates of such claims to increase over time  such as available claims data and historical trends and experience  as well as future projections of ultimate losses  expenses  premiums and administrative costs 
we adjust these reserves if events or changes in circumstances indicate that ultimate payments related to the claims will be more than the recorded reserves 
while we believe that the amounts reserved for these obligations are sufficient  any significant increase in the number of claims and costs associated with claims made under these plans could have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
income taxes 
accounting for income taxes requires us to estimate our income taxes in each jurisdiction in which we operate 
due to differences in the recognition of items included in income for accounting and tax purposes  temporary differences arise which are recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities 
we estimate the likelihood of recovery of these assets  which is dependent on future levels of profitability and enacted tax rates 
should any amounts be determined not to be recoverable  or assumptions change  we would be required to take a charge  which could have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this new statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
under this new standard  goodwill and other intangible assets that are deemed to have an indefinite life are no longer amortized 
however  goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives will be tested for impairment on an annual basis by applying a fair value based test 
we adopted sfas no 
as of january  and therefore ceased amortization of goodwill 
other than cessation of amortization of goodwill  the adoption of sfas no 
had no impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows for the year ended december  goodwill amortization for the twelve months ended december  was  during the fourth quarter of  we completed an impairment test on goodwill and determined that there was no impairment 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
establishes a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of and replaces sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and accounting principles bulletin apb no 
 reporting results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of business 
we adopted sfas no 
effective january  the adoption of sfas no 
had no impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
the statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under previous guidance  a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
the provisions of the statement are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
this statement provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require more prominent and more frequent disclosure in financial statements about the effects of stock based compensation 
we have chosen to continue to account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed by apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years ended after december  accordingly  we have adopted the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
in the financial reports for the year ended december  as the adoption of this statement involves disclosure only  we do not expect a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued financial interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
financial interpretation no 
elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees  including loan guarantees such as standby letters of credit 
it also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee  the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value  or market value  of the obligations it assumes under that guarantee and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements 
financial interpretation no 
is to be applied prospectively to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements in this interpretation are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  we have adopted the disclosure provisions of fin we believe the adoption of this statement will not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
variable interest entities have been commonly referred to as special purpose entities or off balance sheet structures 
the purpose of fin no 
is to improve financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities by requiring consolidation of such entities 
fin no 
is to be applied immediately to variable interest entities created after january  the consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  certain of the disclosure requirements apply in all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established 
we believe the adoption of this statement will not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
issues and uncertainties while management is optimistic about our long term prospects  the following issues and uncertainties  among others  should be considered in evaluating our outlook 
we have contracts with a limited number of carrier customers 
if we fail to extend or renew these contracts  or if these contracts are terminated prior to their expiration  our business could be adversely affected 
a limited number of customers account for substantially all our revenues 
for example  our top four customers accounted for approximately of our revenues in our two largest customers  sprint pcs and at t wireless services  accounted for approximately each in our contract with sprint pcs expired on december  as described above in significant events 
of our existing contracts with significant customers  two expire in  including our contract with at t wireless services 
in addition  while our contract with nextel communications extends through early in  the contract provides for a window in during which nextel can withdraw from the contract with proper notice and payment of a substantial fee 
some contracts contain performance and other standards and may be terminated prior to their scheduled expiration dates under specified circumstances 
if we fail to extend or replace our contracts  or other contracts are terminated prior to their expiration  our business could be adversely affected 
although we seek to increase the number of our customers  opportunities are limited because a small number of companies dominate the telecommunications market 
this limits the potential carrier customer base and our expansion opportunities through carrier relationships 
our inability to achieve desired pricing levels could adversely affect our profitability and operations 
we are subject to competitive pressures with respect to pricing that could adversely affect our profitability and operations 
the prices that we charge our carrier customers are subject to the terms of our contracts 
the changing telecommunications market  the relative leverage of the negotiating parties and the overall competitive landscape can significantly impact contract pricing negotiations 
we charge our carrier customers on a per call basis  with prices varying in some cases based on call volume 
our long term strategy is based in part on reducing the price we charge our carrier customers 
generally  our pricing levels have declined and  in the future  will likely continue to decline as call volumes increase with specific carrier customers 
if we were to substantially reduce our prices without correspondingly increasing volume  there could be an adverse impact on our ability to operate profitably 
we face substantial competition from a number of other companies 
many of our competitors in the directory assistance market  including the regional bell operating companies  have far greater resources and better name recognition 
the regional bell operating companies also may have the advantage of being the local telephone carrier in their area of operation 
some of these companies are or may be developing their own versions of quality directory assistance services 
we also face competition from a number of other independent directory assistance providers 
if we are unable to compete successfully  it could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to compete successfully depends  in part  on our ability to anticipate and appropriately respond to many factors  including retail pricing decisions by carriers  decisions by carriers to force consumers to accept lower quality information services products  the introduction of new services and products by our competitors  changes in subscriber preferences  changes in economic conditions and discount pricing strategies by our competitors 
we are dependent on the wireless telecommunications industry  and a decrease in wireless usage by subscribers could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
almost all of our revenues come from providing enhanced directory assistance and information services to our wireless carrier customers subscribers 
a decrease in wireless usage in general  or of our products in particular  could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
wireless usage by subscribers appears to be affected by a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control  including pricing  safety concerns  reliability and availability of the wireless network  government regulation and reliability and availability of alternative technologies 
our quarterly and annual operating results may vary significantly in part due to factors outside our control 
in the future  as in the past  our quarterly and annual operating results may vary significantly as a result of a number of factors 
we cannot control many of these factors  which include  among others changes in the telecommunications market  including the addition or withdrawal of carriers from the market  changes in technology and increased competition from existing and new competitors  the timing of the commencement of our services under new or existing contracts with our carrier customers  which depends in part on the customers ability to adapt their networks and billing systems to allow them to transfer calls to us  the timing and expense of our call center network expansion or contraction  including changing staffing and infrastructure expenses related to anticipated call volume changes  the addition or expiration of contracts with carrier customers  changes in our or our competitors  customers or suppliers pricing policies  lengthy sales cycles for new and extended contracts  increases in costs associated with new product development and marketing or with growth strategies without commensurate increases in revenues 
lack of market acceptance or delays or increased development costs related to the introduction of our services or features  and general economic conditions 
for these reasons  you should not rely on period to period comparisons of our financial results as an indication of any future results 
our future operating results could fall below the expectations of securities industry analysts or investors 
any such shortfall could result in a decline in the market price of our common stock 
fluctuations in our operating results would likely increase the volatility of our common stock price 
the rapidly changing telecommunications market could unfavorably affect us 
the telecommunications market is subject to rapid change and uncertainty that may result in competitive situations which could unfavorably affect us 
these changes and uncertainties are due to  among other factors  the following mergers  acquisitions and alliances among carriers and among our competitors  which can result in fewer carriers in the marketplace  lost carrier customers  increased negotiating leverage for newly affiliated carriers and more effective competitors  changes in the regulatory environment  which may affect us directly  by affecting our ability to access and update listings data at a reasonable cost  or indirectly  by restricting our carrier customers ability to operate or provide a competitive service  increasing availability of alternative methods for delivery of directory assistance and other information services  including the internet  evolving industry standards  including frequent technological changes and new product introductions  and changes in retail prices offered to consumers for our services or for services perceived to be substitutes for ours  in whole or in part 
we have a long sales cycle which may cause delays that adversely affect our revenue growth and operating results 
a customer s decision to contract for our directory assistance and information services involves a significant commitment of technical and other resources 
as a result  we have a long sales cycle for both new and extended contracts  particularly with large customers 
the selling process involves demonstrating the value added benefits of outsourcing directory assistance and using our services rather than those of our competitors 
additionally  the effectiveness of our marketing to other types of customers  including businesses  governmental units or callers attracted through other means or affiliations  is difficult to predict at any given point in time  given a wide variety of potential business circumstances 
any delays due to lengthy sales cycles could significantly affect our revenue growth and operating results 
our operating results are significantly affected by our ability to accurately estimate the amount and timing of call volume 
the actual amount and timing of call volume is often subject to factors outside of our control 
our operating results are significantly affected by costs incurred for staffing and expanding infrastructure 
we incur significant staffing and general and administrative costs in anticipation of call volume under our customer contracts 
if such call volume does not arrive as scheduled  in the amount anticipated  or at all  our operating results can be adversely affected 
this could increase our operating expenses without a corresponding increase in revenues from the anticipated call volume 
we need to expand call volume and increase efficiencies in order to be successful 
in order to successfully execute our business strategies  we need to increase the volume of calls made to our call center network  while realizing the benefits of operating leverage 
we intend to increase call volume by seeking additional customers  including landline carrier customers  as well as seeking additional business from our existing carrier customers and by offering our services to other types of customers 
we have limited experience in the landline market  which is dominated by the regional bell operating companies 
if we are unable to expand our wireless business or attract significant landline business  on a cost effective basis or at all  we may be unable to increase profitability or sustain past growth rates 
regulations affecting our customers and suppliers and future regulations to which we may be subject may adversely affect our business 
while our principal business as a wholesale supplier of enhanced directory assistance and information services for telecommunications common carriers has not been directly regulated  the offering of those services to the public by our telecommunications carrier customers is regulated by the federal communications commission and state regulatory authorities to varying degrees 
recently  telecommunications carriers have inquired as to our future willingness to carry telecommunications traffic for them on an outsourced basis 
also  the fcc has opened an inquiry concerning promotion of competition in the retail directory assistance market 
we can predict neither the timing nor the outcome of that proceeding or its ultimate impact  if any  on our operations 
new product initiatives or our efforts to pursue additional growth strategies may subject us to further regulation by v arious regulatory agencies including the fcc and state and local public utility commissions 
to the extent we carry telecommunciations traffic ourselves  for our benefit or for the benefit of others outsourced  we may be directly subject to regulation similar to that imposed on telecommunications common carriers  including the carrier customers from whom we have derived our principal business 
future acquisitions or efforts to pursue additional growth strategies may strain our operations 
we intend to evaluate  and in the future may pursue  acquisition or business opportunities that are consistent with our business strategy 
if we fail to adequately address financial and operational risks associated with such acquisitions or business opportunities  such activities may adversely affect our business 
these risks can include  among other things difficulties in assimilating the operations  technology  information systems and personnel of an acquired company  including the inability to maintain uniform standards  controls and policies  and the loss of key employees of the acquired company  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  impairment of relationships with licensors  customers and suppliers  difficulties in entering into markets in which we have no direct prior experience and potential marketing expenses related thereto  use of cash resources  potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities and incurrence of additional debt and contingent liabilities  and significant write offs related to goodwill and amortization expenses related to other intangible assets 
if we are unable to anticipate changes in technology and industry standards and to develop new services and features  we may not succeed 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to anticipate changes in technology and industry standards and to develop and introduce new services and features that are accepted by the marketplace and cost effective for us to provide as a part of our overall service offerings 
the development of new services and features can be very expensive 
further  given rapid technological changes  frequent introduction of new products  services and features  and changing consumer demands that characterize our industry  it can be difficult to correctly anticipate future changes in technology and industry standards 
if we fail to develop new services and features  encounter difficulties that delay the introduction of such services and features  or incorrectly anticipate future changes and develop services and features that are not accepted by the marketplace or are not cost effective for us to provide as a part of our overall service offerings  we may not succeed at our business 
alternative methods for delivery of directory assistance and information services could reduce the demand for our services 
our business comes primarily from providing enhanced directory assistance and information services to telephone users 
however  information can be transmitted in other ways  including more intelligent communications devices and other technologies and protocols  and over the internet 
for example  as the internet continues to develop and becomes easier to use and access  technologies may be developed that decrease or eliminate the demand for telephone based or voice based directory or information services 
widespread acceptance of existing and developing technologies and protocols  such as voice recognition and wireless application protocol  could adversely affect our business 
our call volume could decline if telephone users change their usage habits and rely on the internet or other alternatives as their primary source for information 
systems failures  delays and other problems could harm our reputation and business  cause us to lose customers and expose us to customer liability 
our success also depends on our ability to provide reliable services 
our operations could be interrupted by significant damage to or failure of our network  our connections to third parties  our computer hardware or software or our customers or suppliers computer hardware or software 
any such significant damage or failure could disrupt the operations of our network and the provision of our services and result in the loss of current and potential customers 
in addition  as call volume increases  we will need to expand and upgrade our technology and network hardware and software in order to provide services 
capacity limits on our technology and network hardware and software may make it difficult for us to expand and upgrade our systems in a timely and economical manner 
if we are unable to obtain or adequately update directory or information content at an economical cost  we may be unable to provide current levels of service or improve our service 
our operations depend on our access to the names  telephone numbers and other information that we supply directly to callers or we use in providing our services 
the availability  cost  quality and usefulness of such data varies widely across geographic regions 
if we are unable to obtain or update directory or information content at an economical cost  we may be unable to provide current levels of service  improve our enhanced directory assistance service or provide new services and features 
ultimately  the satisfaction of callers and our carrier customers  and our ability to renew and extend our current customer contracts and enter into new customer contracts  depends on the quality of services we provide 
the quality of our services is directly related to the quality of our listings data and other information content 
as we rely on a limited number of suppliers  an abrupt loss of any key supplier could adversely affect our business operations or delay our development efforts 
we rely on some key suppliers to provide us with programming and engineering services and to license us their technology 
an abrupt loss of any current key supplier could cause a disruption in our operations or a delay in our development efforts  including the planned expansion of our call center network  and could adversely affect our business operations 
if we are unable to continue to attract and retain qualified senior management  technical personnel and call center operators  or our call center staff is unionized  our operations could be adversely affected 
our success depends to a significant extent on the efforts and abilities of our senior management  technical personnel and call center operators 
the loss of the services of our senior management and technical personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and our ability to meet our strategic objectives 
we also depend on the continued service of our call center operators  who we hire from the available labor pool 
as we continue to expand our call center network  the ability to attract and retain qualified senior management  technical personnel  operators and other skilled employees is extremely important to the operation of our business 
if we are unable to attract and retain qualified individuals  or we are required to pay significantly higher wages and other benefits to such individuals  or if our call center staff is unionized  it could adversely affect our business operations 
we find it more difficult to recruit and retain qualified individuals during periods of low unemployment and  therefore  may be subject to increasing pressure to offer higher wages and other benefits during such periods 
in our call center hiring  we may also feel the effects of the telecommunications industry in general  which has widespread union membership among its operators and other workers 
if we are unable to use and protect our intellectual property  we may be unable to provide some of our enhanced directory assistance and information services or profitably operate our business 
we regard aspects of our enhanced directory assistance and information services and their features and processes to be proprietary 
if we are unable to use and protect our intellectual property  we may be unable to provide some of our enhanced directory assistance and information services or profitably operate our business 
to a limited extent  we rely on a combination of trade secret  patent and other intellectual property law  nondisclosure agreements and other protective measures to protect our intellectual property 
however  these measures may be difficult and costly to meaningfully enforce 
in addition  attempts to enforce our intellectual property rights may bring into question the validity of these rights 
litigation with respect to patents or other intellectual property rights can result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and other resources 
we may need additional capital in the future  and it may not be available on acceptable terms 
we may require more capital in the future to fund our operations  finance investments in equipment and infrastructure needed to maintain and expand our call center and network capabilities  enhance and expand the range of services and features we offer  respond to competitive pressures and potential opportunities  such as investments  acquisitions and international expansion and new product initiatives and growth strategies 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
the terms of available financing may place limits on our financial and operating flexibility 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  we may be forced to reduce our operations or abandon expansion opportunities 
if we expand our business into international markets  we will encounter risks which could adversely affect us 
we have operated only in the united states  however  an element of our business strategy is to continue to explore international business opportunities 
we anticipate accepting calls inbound to the united states in if we expand into one or more international markets  we will encounter significant risks and uncertainties 
these risks and uncertainties include increased operational difficulties arising from  among other things our ability to attract sufficient business or locate a suitable partner or joint venture candidate to enable us to overcome logistical and economic barriers to entry  our ability and cost to gather sufficient information content and listings data  properly modify our features and services to meet applicable standards  and hire and train personnel  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  and political  regulatory and economic developments and cultural differences 
our common stock price is volatile 
the market price of our common stock has experienced volatility and is likely to continue to experience significant fluctuations in response to a number of factors 
these factors include  among others  the following announcements of extensions  expirations or changes in our contracts and the opening of new call centers to support such activity  announcements relating to material events concerning our customers  actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  obsolescence of technologies that we or our customers use  introductions of new technologies  products or features  new product initiatives and growth strategies  and general market conditions 
from january  through december   our common stock price fluctuated from a low of per share to a high of per share and has on several days fluctuated more than 
similar market fluctuations have affected the market prices of equity securities of many telecommunications companies and other public companies generally 
these trading prices and valuations may change significantly and arbitrarily 
in addition  broad market factors affecting telecommunications or technology stocks may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
general economic  political and market conditions  including interest rate changes and recession  may also adversely affect our stock price 
our results of operations could be impacted by a significant increase in the rate of inflation 
inflation has not historically had a material affect on our business 
operating expenses such as salaries  employee benefits and occupancy costs are  however  subject to normal inflationary pressures which could adversely affect our operating results 
oregon law and provisions of our charter could make the acquisition of our company more difficult 
we are authorized to issue up to  shares of preferred stock  and the board of directors has the authority to fix the preferences  limitations and relative rights of those shares without any vote or action by the shareholders 
the potential issuance of preferred stock may delay or prevent a change in control of our company  may discourage bids for the common stock at a premium over the market price and may adversely affect the market price of  and the voting and other rights of the holders of  our common stock 
in addition  provisions under oregon law limit the ability of parties who acquire a significant amount of voting stock to exercise control over our company 
these provisions may have the effect of lengthening the time required for a person to acquire control of our company through a proxy contest or the election of a majority of the board of directors and may deter efforts to obtain control of our company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk substantially all of our liquid investments are invested in money market instruments  and therefore  the fair market value of these investments is affected by changes in market interest rates 
however  these investments were invested in overnight money market instruments at december  and were redeemable on a daily basis 
all of the underlying investments in the money market fund had maturities of three months or less 
as a result  we believe the market risk arising from our holdings of financial instruments is minimal 
a hypothetical fluctuation in interest rates would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows
