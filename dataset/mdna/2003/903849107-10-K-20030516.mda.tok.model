item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we opened our first store in we grew to nine stores in colorado by fiscal and then adopted an expansion strategy to enter new markets in the rocky mountain  midwest and southwest regions 
by the end of fiscal  we had grown to stores 
in june  we acquired audio king corporation  a consumer electronics specialty retailer with retail stores in minnesota  iowa and south dakota 
we then opened one store in fiscal  one store in fiscal  five stores in fiscal  ten stores in fiscal and stores in fiscal we currently operate stores in states 
we plan to open seven stores in fiscal we have signed leases for all of these store locations 
our investment cost for large format stores opened in the last two fiscal years has been approximately million per store  including leasehold improvements  fixtures and equipment  inventory net of payables and preopening expenses 
our large format stores have typically been profitable on a store operating basis within their first months of operation and  on average  return our investment in three years or less 
the timing of our new store openings and relocations will significantly impact our results of operations and financial condition in future periods 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and assumptions 
we believe that  of the significant accounting policies described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the following involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity  and are therefore considered critical 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise or such merchandise is delivered to the customer 
we recognize revenues from services  such as home and mobile installation  home delivery and setup  and repair services  at the time the service is provided 
sales  which includes net warranty revenue  consists of gross sales less discounts  rebates  price guarantees  returns and allowances 
we sell consumer electronics and home entertainment products 
along with the sale of this merchandise  we offer and sell installation services and or warranties  which can be purchased separately by the customer 
revenues from non merchandise components represent approximately of our total sales 
we sell extended warranty contracts on behalf of a fully insured unrelated party 
the contracts extend beyond the normal manufacturer s warranty period  usually with terms of coverage including the manufacturer s warranty period between and months 
the extended warranty contracts are administered by a third party and all performance obligations and risk of loss with respect to such contracts are the responsibility of such administrator and other parties 
effective february   we restructured our extended warranty master contract with the administrator 
for extended warranty contracts entered into after february   we are a non obligor and  therefore  we recognize commissions from the sale of these non obligor contracts as revenues at the time of sale to customers 
we are deemed to be the obligor under the extended warranty contracts entered into prior to february   and we recognize revenues over the term of these obligor contracts  generally to months 
revenues from extended warranty contracts entered into prior to february   will be amortized in decreasing amounts through fiscal advertising costs and cooperative revenue change in accounting principle in accordance with aicpa statement of position  reporting on advertising costs  all advertising costs are deferred until the first time the advertising takes place 
we reduce advertising expense with cooperative advertising from our vendors 
cooperative advertising payments vary with individual programs and with individual vendors 
in november and subsequently clarified in march  the emerging issues task force reached a consensus on issue no 
 accounting by customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor eitf 
eitf addresses two specific issues related to the classification of consideration received from a vendor cooperative advertising payment by us in our income statement 
issue of eitf addresses the circumstances under which cash consideration received from a vendor by us should be considered a an adjustment of the prices of the vendor s products or services and  therefore  characterized as a reduction of cost of sales when recognized in our income statement  b an adjustment to a cost incurred by us and  therefore  characterized as a reduction of that cost when recognized in our income statement  or c a payment for assets or services delivered to the vendor and  therefore  characterized as revenue when recognized in our income statement 
issue of eitf is effective for new arrangements or modification of existing arrangements entered into after december  although early adoption is permitted 
issue of eitf discusses when we should recognize the rebate and how we should measure the amount of the offer when a vendor offers us a rebate or refund of a specified amount of cash consideration that is payable only if we complete a specified cumulative level of purchases or remain a customer for a specified time period 
issue of eitf is effective for arrangements entered after november  we elected to adopt early  effective february   the provisions of eitf in the preparation of this annual report on form k 
accordingly  in fiscal  we recorded a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of million  million net of income tax  for the impact of this adoption related to prior fiscal years 
as of january   million of our cooperative advertising allowances has been deferred into inventory and will be recognized as inventory is sold 
this adoption has also resulted in the reclassification of million in cooperative advertising payments earned in fiscal from selling  general and administrative expense to cost of sales retroactively as of the beginning of fiscal the fiscal impact of adoption on income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle was million  net of income tax 
gross advertising expense charged to operations was million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
cooperative advertising rebates  netted against gross advertising expense  were million  million and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
inventories we state merchandise inventories at the lower of cost weighted average cost or market 
physical inventory counts are performed by us on a regular basis at all stores and warehouse locations to ensure amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements are properly stated 
significant management judgment is required to determine the reserve for obsolete or excess inventory 
inventory on hand may exceed future demand because a product may either be discontinued or become technologically outdated earlier than anticipated 
inventories are presented net of an allowance for obsolescence of million and million at january  and  respectively 
long lived assets long lived assets including property and equipment  capitalized management information system costs and goodwill are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
we are required to perform an annual impairment test of goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard statement no 
 goodwill and intangibles 
additionally  statement of financial accounting standards statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  addresses impairment with respect to our property and equipment and capitalized management information system assets 
under sfas  we are required to recognize an impairment loss when estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of these assets and their value upon disposal are less than their carrying amount 
as of and for the year ended january   we did not recognize any impairment of our long lived assets as a result of these standards 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the relative percentages that certain income and expense items bear to sales percentage of sales for the years ended january  sales cost of goods sold gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations net interest expense income before taxes  extraordinary item and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle income tax expense income before extraordinary item and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt  net of taxes cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of taxes net income fiscal compared to fiscal sales 
for the year ended january   sales were million  a increase from sales of million for the prior year 
the increase in sales during fiscal was primarily due to sales from the new stores opened during the year and the full year sales for the stores that opened in fiscal this increase was partially offset by a decrease in comparable store sales of for the year due to the poor general market conditions in the markets we serve and the aggressive promotional environment for consumer electronics retailers 
comparable store sales include sales for stores open at least months and exclude i sales for stores recently relocated and expanded until months after completion and ii sales for stores in new markets until months after of the initial number of stores planned for the market have opened 
revenues from extended warranty contracts entered into prior to february  recognized during fiscal were approximately  compared to approximately  for fiscal and will be recognized in decreasing amounts through fiscal gross profit 
costs of goods sold includes merchandise costs  buying costs and warehousing and distribution costs less vendor purchase discounts and volume rebates 
gross profit in fiscal increased to million of sales from million of sales in fiscal the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales was due to a reclassification of million  or of sales  of fiscal cooperative advertising allowances from selling  general and administrative expense in connection with our change in accounting principle related to the adoption of eitf this reclass was partially offset by reduced amortization of warranties sold prior to february  approximately basis points 
the continued shift in merchandise mix to lower margin categories also negatively impacted gross margins 
over the last three years  we have experienced a continued shift in our merchandise mix from higher margin products such as audio and mobile electronics to lower margin products such as television and dvd 
for example  sales of audio products have decreased from of total sales during fiscal to of total sales in fiscal  while sales of televisions and dbs products have increased from of total sales during fiscal to of total sales in fiscal this shift in merchandise mix has negatively impacted our gross profit margins 
at the same time  our gross margins in most product categories have increased  which has partially offset the decrease in our gross profit margins due to the shift in merchandise mix 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses include net advertising costs  occupancy costs  payroll  depreciation  computer costs  credit card and check processing fees  third party financing fees and all other expenses necessary to operate our business 
selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal increased to million of sales from million of sales in fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales was partially due to a reclassification of million  or of sales  of fiscal cooperative advertising allowances to cost of sales in connection with our change in accounting principle 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were also impacted by the decrease in comparable store sales as well as the expenses associated with new stores opened during the year and the full year contribution of the ten new stores opened in fiscal for the year  rent increased approximately basis points  fees from interest free promotions increased approximately basis points and payroll increased by approximately basis points 
other expenses such as insurance costs  preopening expenses and other fixed expenses represented the remaining approximately basis points of the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales 
income from operations 
as a result of the foregoing  income from operations decreased to million of sales from million of sales in fiscal interest income 
interest income for fiscal increased to  from  in fiscal we generated significant interest income in fiscal from the investments of the proceeds from our public offering of common stock completed in may interest expense 
interest expense was  in both fiscal and fiscal income taxes 
our effective tax rate of in fiscal was the same as the prior year 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 
we changed our accounting principle with respect to recording cooperative advertising allowances effective retroactively as of the beginning of fiscal as a result  we recorded a non cash charge of million  net of income tax  in the first quarter of fiscal for the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle on fiscal years prior to fiscal net income 
net income for fiscal was million compared to million for the prior year  for the reasons described above 
the net income from extended warranty contracts entered into prior to february   was  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal and is expected to be approximately  in fiscal and  in fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal sales 
for the year ended january   sales were million  a increase from sales of million for the prior year 
the increase in sales during fiscal was primarily due to sales from the new stores opened during the year and the full year contribution of the six new stores opened in fiscal in the first three quarters of fiscal  we experienced negative single digit comparable store sales  a trend that was further aggravated by the terrorist attacks on september  we generated a comparable store sales growth in the fourth quarter due to improved consumer confidence and increased demand for digital products 
gross profit 
gross profit in fiscal increased to million of sales from million of sales in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased approximately basis points 
this decrease was due to higher than expected inventory shrinkage in the fourth quarter a decrease in gross profit of approximately basis points and reduced amortization of warranties sold prior to february  a decrease in gross profit of approximately basis points 
this decrease was partially offset by higher margins in most product categories an increase in gross profit of approximately basis points 
the continued shift in merchandise mix to lower margin categories also negatively impacted gross margins 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal increased to million of sales from million of sales in fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales was primarily the result of increased occupancy costs for new stores an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of approximately basis points and lower than planned comparable store sales growth for the year an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of approximately basis points 
income from operations 
as a result of the foregoing  income from operations decreased to million of sales from million of sales in fiscal interest income 
interest income for fiscal decreased to  from  in fiscal we generated significant interest income in fiscal from the investment of the proceeds of our public offering of common stock completed in october during fiscal  such investments were liquidated to finance our expansion 
interest expense 
interest expense for fiscal increased to  from  in fiscal we incurred  of interest expense for the first two months of fiscal related to public bonds we sold in march we redeemed these bonds on march  the earliest redemption date allowable under the terms of the bonds with the proceeds from the october public offering 
income taxes 
our effective tax rate was in fiscal compared to in fiscal primarily due to the state tax impact of new markets 
net income 
net income for fiscal was million compared to million for the prior year  for the reasons described above 
net income from extended warranty contracts entered into prior to february   was approximately  in fiscal and  in fiscal quarterly results of operations the following table shows certain financial and operating data for each of the most recent eight quarters

new stores opened comparable store sales as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the company changed its accounting principle with respect to recording cooperative advertising allowances effective retroactively as of the beginning of fiscal as a result  the company recorded a non cash charge of million  million net of income tax  in the first quarter of fiscal for the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle on fiscal years prior to fiscal this adoption also resulted in the reclassification of million in cooperative advertising payments earned in fiscal from selling  general and administrative expense to cost of sales retroactively as of the beginning of fiscal the fiscal impact of adoption on income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle was million  net of income tax 
quarterly results for fiscal have been restated to reflect the company s new accounting principle for cooperative advertising allowances 
operating results are dependent upon a number of factors  including discretionary consumer spending  which is affected by local  regional and national economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income  such as employment  business conditions  interest rates and taxation 
our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly as a result of a number of factors  including comparable store sales and the success of new stores  the timing of new store openings and store relocations  the amount of store preopening expenses  the amount of grand opening expenses incurred in new markets  weather conditions in our markets  the mix of consumer electronics products sold in our stores  the availability of new products  general conditions in the economy and the financial markets  terrorist acts and acts of war  actions by our competitors  including grand opening and store closing sales by competitors  and timing of receipt of cooperative advertising payments from vendors 
as we have opened additional stores within markets we already serve  sales at existing stores have been adversely affected 
such adverse effects may occur in the future 
in the past  we have experienced significant variability in preopening costs from quarter to quarter 
these fluctuations are primarily a function of the timing of new store openings 
we typically incur the most significant portion of preopening costs associated with a given store in the three months prior to its opening 
our business is affected by seasonal consumer buying patterns 
as is the case with many other retailers  our sales and profits have been greatest in the fourth quarter which includes the holiday selling season 
due to the importance of the holiday selling season  any factors negatively impacting the holiday selling season could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources historically  our primary sources of liquidity for funding our expansion have been net cash from operations  revolving credit lines  term debt and issuances of common stock 
our primary cash requirements are related to expenditures for new store openings  the relocation and or remodeling of existing store locations and inventory build up prior to the holiday selling season 
expenditures for new store openings include leasehold improvements  fixtures and equipment  additional inventory requirements  preopening expenses and selling  general and administrative expenses 
we currently operate a total of stores in states 
net cash used in operating activities equaled million for fiscal compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for fiscal  primarily due to higher inventory and accounts receivable balances in fiscal net cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal  primarily for capital expenditures for new store openings and continued implementation of our new management information system 
the increase in projected capital expenditures for fiscal from our original estimate of million is primarily due to additional costs associated with our management information system and the opening of our twelfth store during fiscal for fiscal  net cash used in investing activities was million  primarily for new store openings  the installation of warehouse management software  the reconfiguration and expansion of our warehouse and distribution center and the implementation of our new management information system 
this amount is net of proceeds we received from a sale leaseback arrangement on a new store in colorado springs  colorado 
we expect total capital expenditures to be between and million in fiscal  primarily for new store openings  several remodels of our existing stores and completion of the implementation of our new management information system 
we currently plan to open seven new stores and to remodel our two las vegas stores in addition to the relocation of our rochester  minnesota store in march we have signed leases for all of the new store locations 
the cost of new stores is anticipated to average approximately million per store during fiscal  which amount includes leasehold improvements  fixtures and equipment  inventory net of payables and preopening expenses 
leasehold improvements  fixtures and equipment are expected to average approximately million per store  depending on tenant allowances 
the inventory requirement for each new store is expected to average approximately million  approximately  of which will be financed through trade credits from our vendors 
preopening expenses for new stores are expected to average approximately  and include costs for advertising prior to opening and recruitment and training of new employees 
if we relocate existing stores  preopening costs are expected to average  and will be higher if we are required to terminate existing store leases prior to their maturity 
total capital expenditures for fiscal also include capital expenditures of approximately million anticipated to complete the implementation of our new management information system 
through january   we had expended approximately million on our new management information system 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled million during fiscal compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million during fiscal net cash provided by financing activities for fiscal was primarily the result of the net proceeds we received from our may  offering  partially offset by net repayments of our revolving line of credit 
net cash provided by financing activities for the prior year was primarily related to net borrowings on our revolving line of credit 
we currently have an million credit agreement with wells fargo finance  llc  which expires in september borrowings under this revolving line of credit are limited to the lesser of i million or ii of eligible inventory plus the lesser of of eligible accounts receivable and million 
amounts borrowed bear interest  payable monthly  based on a blend of i libor plus to and ii wells fargo bank s prime rate minus 
our weighted average interest rate was at january  inventories  bank accounts  accounts receivable  equipment  intangibles  negotiable instruments  investment property  intellectual property and equity interests in our subsidiaries secure the borrowings 
the facility includes negative covenants that place restrictions on our ability to incur indebtedness  create liens  enter into mergers and consolidations  pay dividends  repurchase our capital stock  issue guarantees  sell or otherwise dispose of assets and engage in transactions with affiliates without the written consent of the bank 
the facility also contains covenants regarding our gross margins  inventory levels  tangible net worth and capital expenditures 
we were in compliance with all loan covenants as of january  as of january   we had a borrowing base of million  of which approximately million was outstanding 
on may   we completed a public offering for the sale of  shares of our common stock at an offering price of per share 
we received proceeds of approximately million net of all offering costs 
we used a portion of the proceeds from our offering to pay down our revolving line of credit  in full  on may  our return on assets roa ratio and return on equity roe ratio for fiscal decreased at a greater percentage than the percentage decrease in net income in fiscal  primarily because our comparable store sales were a negative 
the decrease in comparable store sales reduced our ability to leverage our expected increases in sales against our fixed costs  directly impacting our net income 
in addition  our roa ratio was negatively affected by i our addition of new stores during fiscal and new stores during fiscal as new stores generate a marginal return on investment during the first few years of operation and ii our significant investment in the development of our new management information system  which system has not yet been implemented 
if comparable store sales continue to be negative for a prolonged period  the decrease in our roa and roe ratios will continue at a greater rate than the decrease in our net income 
we believe that our cash flow from operations and borrowings under our revolving line of credit will be sufficient to fund our operations  debt repayment and anticipated expansion through fiscal to fund the capital requirements for our anticipated expansion plans beyond that time  we may be required to seek additional financing  which could include an increase in our revolving line of credit or additional debt or equity financings 
we may also remortgage our thornton  colorado facility 
we may not be able to obtain such funds on favorable terms  if at all 
the following table reflects our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of january  contractual obligations payments due by period less than year years years over years total in thousands capital lease obligations   operating leases      purchase commitments   construction commitments   other commercial commitments amount of commitment expiration by period less than year years years over years total in thousands revolving line of credit   the principal balance outstanding under our revolving line of credit was approximately million as of january  all amounts outstanding under our revolving line of credit will need to be repaid on september   unless our line of credit is renewed 
impact of inflation we believe that inflation has not had a significant effect on results of operations during the last few years 
we cannot predict whether inflation will have an impact on our results of operations in the future

 accounting by customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor eitf 
eitf addresses two specific issues related to the classification of consideration received from a vendor cooperative advertising payment by us in our income statement
