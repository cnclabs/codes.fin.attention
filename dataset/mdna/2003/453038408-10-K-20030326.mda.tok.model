net earnings in were  million or a share  compared with  million or a share in  million  or a share 
higher prices for bitumen largely offset lower prices for natural gas  reduced production of crude oil and weak markets for petroleum products 
earnings in included after tax gains of million on asset sales  compared with gains of million in gains of million 
compared to  the positive factors affecting earnings were higher resource prices by million  higher product volumes by million  lower expenses by million and favourable foreign exchange effects on us dollar debt by million 
compared to  the negative factors affecting earnings were lower product margins by million and reduced production of oil and gas by million 
the following table shows the company s net earnings by segment for the five years ending december  millions natural resources   petroleum products chemicals corporate and other net earnings    natural resources earnings from natural resources were  million the second best year on record up from million in  million 
higher prices for blended bitumen more than offset the effects of lower prices for natural gas and decreased production of crude oil 
included in the earnings were gains of million from the sale of assets  unchanged from gains of million 
compared to  the positive factors affecting earnings were higher prices by million 
compared to  the negative factors affecting earnings were reduced production of oil and gas by million and higher project related and other expenses by million 
resource revenues were billion  down from billion in billion 
the main reasons for the decline were lower natural gas prices and decreased production of crude oil 
world prices for light crude oil were slightly higher in than the previous year 
the annual average price of brent crude oil  the most actively traded north sea crude and a common benchmark of world oil markets  was us a barrel in  compared with in 
prices strengthened considerably as the year progressed  beginning much lower than the previous year  but ending the year higher 
the company s realizations on sales of conventional canadian crude mirrored the same trends as world prices 
average realizations during the year were cdn a barrel versus in 
in contrast  world markets for heavy oil were tighter throughout the year  reflecting reduced global supplies 
this contributed to a strengthening of prices for canadian heavy oil  including blended bitumen from cold lake 
the price of bow river  a benchmark canadian heavy crude oil  increased by more than percent in  compared with a two percent increase in prices for canadian light crude oil 
prices for canadian natural gas in  while strong by historical standards  were lower on average than in the previous year 
the average of day spot prices for natural gas at the aeco hub in alberta was about a thousand cubic feet in  down from a thousand in the company s average realizations on natural gas sales decreased to a thousand cubic feet from a thousand in 
gross production of crude oil and natural gas liquids ngls decreased to  barrels a day from  barrels in 
net production decreased to  barrels a day from  barrels in 
net bitumen production at the company s cold lake operation was  barrels a day  down from  barrels in 
the decline resulted from the timing of steam injections associated with the recovery process used at cold lake 
the effective royalty rate on cold lake production was unchanged from production from the syncrude operation  in which the company has a percent interest  increased in the year as a result of greater operating reliability 
gross production of upgraded crude oil rose to  barrels a day from  barrels in 
the company s share of average net production increased to  barrels a day from  barrels in 
net production of conventional oil decreased to  barrels a day from  barrels in  as a result of the natural decline in western canadian reservoirs 
net production of natural gas was million cubic feet a day in  largely unchanged from million in million 
net production available for sale increased to million cubic feet a day from million in million 
the primary reason for the increase was a reduction in the company s natural gas used in its own operations 
operating costs  including exploration expenses  increased by about one percent in the main factor was increased costs associated with planned expenses for the start up of the cold lake expansion and other growth projects 
proceeds from divestments and property sales in natural resources were million in  up from million in million 
the following table shows the company s capital and exploration expenditures for natural resources during the five years ending december  millions exploration production heavy oil total about percent of the capital and exploration expenditures in was focused on growth opportunities 
the largest single investment during the year was the company s share of the syncrude expansion 
significant expenditures were also made to complete development of cold lake stages to the remainder of investment was directed to east coast development and exploration  advancing the mackenzie gas project and drilling for conventional oil and gas in western canada 
planned capital and exploration expenditures in natural resources are expected to total about billion in  with nearly percent of the total focused on growth opportunities 
much of the expenditure will be directed to the expansion now underway at syncrude 
investments are also planned for the mackenzie gas project  continued maintenance at cold lake  development of a second tier of the sable offshore energy project  as well as on further development drilling in western canada 
planned expenditures for exploration and development drilling  as well as for capacity additions in conventional oil and gas operations  are expected to be about million 
petroleum products net earnings from petroleum products were million or cents a litre in  down from a record million or cents a litre in million or cents a litre 
the decline was caused by reduced industry refining and marketing margins 
compared to  the positive factors affecting earnings were lower expenses by million and higher volumes by million 
compared to  the negative factors affecting earnings were lower refining and marketing margins by million 
revenues were billion  unchanged from the previous year billion 
margins were lower in both the refining and marketing segments of the industry  reflecting high inventories and strong competition 
although refining margins improved late in the year  as north american product inventories returned to more normal levels  average margins for the year as a whole were significantly lower than in average marketing margins were also lower than the previous year 
the company s total sales volumes  including those resulting from reciprocal supply agreements with other companies  were million litres a day  compared with million litres in million 
excluding sales resulting from reciprocal agreements  sales were million litres a day  compared with million litres in million 
operating costs decreased by about three percent in from the previous year 
the following table shows the company s capital expenditures for petroleum products during the five years ending december  millions marketing refining and supply other total consists primarily of purchases of real estate 
capital expenditures increased to million in  compared with million in million 
the company invested more than million in refining operations during the year as part of a million project to eliminate virtually all sulphur from esso gasoline 
in addition  almost million was invested in a variety of refinery projects to improve energy efficiency and increase yield 
major investments were also made to upgrade the network of esso retail outlets in capital expenditures in are expected to be about million 
major items include additional investment in refining facilities to complete the sulphur reduction project and continued enhancements to the company s retail network 
there will also be significant expenditures on a megawatt cogeneration facility in sarnia  slated for completion in  which will improve energy efficiency and reduce emissions at the company s sarnia based petroleum product and chemical operations 
chemicals earnings from chemical operations were million in  up from million in million 
increased margins on sales of polyethylene and a full year of production from an expansion of the polyethylene plant  which was completed in late  were the main reasons for the improvement 
compared to  the positive factors affecting earnings were higher volumes by million and higher margins by million 
compared to  the negative factors affecting earnings were higher volume related expenses by million 
increased sales of intermediate products  which include solvents  plasticizers and industrial alcohols  also contributed to the higher earnings 
total revenues from chemical operations were  million  compared with  million in  million 
prices for both polyethylene and intermediate chemicals were lower in the year  offsetting gains from increased sales volumes 
the average industry price of polyethylene was  a tonne in  down four percent from  a tonne in 
however  margins improved because of lower feedstock costs  reflecting reduced prices for natural gas 
sales of chemicals increased to  tonnes a day from  tonnes a day in  tonnes  following the fifth expansion of the sarnia polyethylene plant 
operating costs in the chemical segment increased by four percent in  largely because of a seven percent increase in total production volumes 
the following table shows the company s capital expenditures for chemicals during the five years ending december  millions of the capital expenditures in  the major investment was the sarnia cogeneration project  a joint development between the petroleum product and chemical operations at the site 
planned expenditures in will increase to more than million  with the majority of the investment relating to the sarnia cogeneration project 
financial review earnings from corporate and other accounts were negative million in  compared with negative million in negative million 
the improvement was mainly attributable to favourable foreign exchange effects on the company s us dollar denominated debt 
cash flow from earnings was  million  down from  million in  million  mainly because of the timing of income tax payments 
cash provided from operating activities was  million  compared with  million in  million 
the main reasons for the reduction were the effects of higher commodity prices on accounts receivable  partly offset by changes to accounts payable  and the timing of income tax payments 
at the beginning of  the company purchased  shares for million  essentially completing the normal course issuer bid share buyback program that had begun in june in june  the company renewed the buyback program for another months 
no shares were purchased under the program during the balance of the year 
since the company initiated its first buyback program in  the company has purchased million shares representing about percent of the total outstanding at the start of the program with resulting distributions to shareholders of  million 
the company declared dividends totalling cents a share in  up from cents in cents 
regular dividends per share have increased in each of the past eight years and  since  payments have grown by more than percent a share 
at year end  the balance of cash and marketable securities was million  compared with million at the end of  million 
in  the company retired the remaining million us of its percent sinking fund debentures due in for million cdn  replacing this long term debt with short term canadian commercial paper 
the company also issued million of floating rate notes under its billion medium term notes program 
they have an initial term of two years and are extendable up to five years at the discretion of noteholders 
total debt outstanding at the end of was  million  compared with  million at the end of  million 
debt related interest expense paid in was million  down from million in million 
generally lower interest rates and the retirement of the company s long term  fixed rate debt during the past few years were the reasons for the reduction 
the average effective interest rate on the company s debt was percent in  compared with percent in percent 
capital and exploration expenditures increased to  million in from  million in million 
the funds were used mainly to maintain and expand crude oil and natural gas production capacity  to upgrade refineries to meet low sulphur gasoline requirements and to enhance the company s retail outlets and rural agency network 
capital and exploration expenditures in  which will focus mainly on growth and productivity improvement  are expected to total about billion and will be financed primarily from internally generated funds 
expenditures in canada on research and development were million in  up from million in million 
these funds were used mainly to develop improved methods for recovering heavy oil and manufacturing polyethylene  as well as developing higher quality lubricants 
during  the company spent more than million on projects related to reducing the environmental impact of operations and improving safety 
this included investments of more than million in the company s four refineries as part of its million capital project to produce lower sulphur gasolines 
the following table shows the company s cash provided from operating activities during the five years ending december  millions in  the company s employee retirement benefit plan will be subject to an actuarial valuation that is required every three years 
at the time of the last required valuation in  the company s registered pension plan was fully funded 
given the downturn in financial markets that has occurred since  the upcoming valuation is expected to result in a requirement for the company to contribute funds to the plan 
the size of any required contribution will not be known until the valuation is completed 
however  the company does not expect the funding requirement to affect its existing capital investment plans or its ability to take advantage of new investment opportunities 
the following table shows the company s long term contractual obligations payment due by period millions of dollars financial statement note reference to and beyond total amount long term debt note   operating leases note unconditional purchase obligations note firm capital commitments note other long term agreements note  total   unconditional purchase obligations mainly pertain to pipeline throughput agreements 
firm capital commitments related to capital projects  shown on an undiscounted basis  totalled approximately million at the end of  compared with million at year end the largest commitment outstanding at year end was associated with the company s share of capital projects at syncrude million 
other long term agreements include primarily raw material supply and transportation services agreements 
critical accounting policies the company s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with canadian generally accepted accounting principles and include estimates that reflect management s best judgments 
the company s accounting and financial reporting fairly reflects its straightforward business model 
the company does not use financing structures for the purpose of altering accounting outcomes or removing debt from the balance sheet 
the following summary provides further information about the critical accounting policies and the estimates that are made by the company to apply those policies 
it should be read in conjunction with pages f to f oil and gas and synthetic crude oil reserves proved oil and gas and synthetic crude oil reserves quantities are used as the basis of calculating the unit of production rates for depreciation and evaluating for impairment 
these reserves are the estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs and deposits under existing economic and operating conditions 
the estimation of reserves is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical evaluations and extrapolations of appropriate information 
while proved reserves have a reasonable certainty of recovery  they are based on estimates that are subject to some variability 
this variability has  however  generally resulted in net upward revisions of proved reserves for the company through effective reservoir management and the application of new technology 
over the last five years  the company s net revisions of previous estimates and improved recovery have averaged an increase of million oil equivalent barrels per year including million oil equivalent barrels of synthetic crude oil 
while revisions the company has made in the past are an indicator of variability  they have had a very small impact on the unit of production rates of depreciation and in impairment testing because the revisions have been small compared to the large proved reserves base 
site restoration costs provision for site restoration costs is recorded when it is probable that obligations have been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably determined 
this provision is based on engineering estimates of costs  taking into account the anticipated method and extent of remediation consistent with legal requirements  industry practices  current technology and the possible use of the site 
changes in these factors may result in material changes to the provision 
retirement benefits the company s pension plan is managed in compliance with the requirements of governmental authorities and meets funding levels as determined by independent third party actuaries 
pension accounting requires explicit assumptions regarding  among others  the discount rate for the benefit obligations  rate of return on plan assets and the long term rate for future pay increases 
all pension assumptions are reviewed annually by senior financial management and at least once every three years by independent third party actuaries 
these assumptions are adjusted only as appropriate to reflect long term changes in market rates and outlook 
the long term expected rate of return on plan assets of percent used in compares to actual returns of percent and percent actually achieved over the last and year periods ending december  if different assumptions are used  the expense and obligations could increase or decrease as a result 
the company s potential exposure to change in assumptions is summarized in footnote e of note to the financial statements 
at the company  differences between actual returns on plan assets versus the long term expected return are amortized in pension expense  along with other actuarial gains and losses 
pension expense represented about one percent of total expenses in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to a variety of financial  operating and market risks in the course of its business 
some of these risks are within the company s control  while others are not 
for those risks that can be controlled  specific risk management strategies are employed to reduce the likelihood of loss 
other risks  such as changes in international commodity prices and currency exchange rates  are beyond the company s control 
the company s potential exposure to these types of risks is summarized in the table on earnings sensitivities 
the amount quoted to illustrate the impact of each sensitivity represents a change of about percent in the value of the commodity or rate in question at the end of each sensitivity calculation shows the impact on earnings that results from a change in one factor  after tax and royalties and holding all other factors constant 
while these sensitivities are applicable under current conditions  they may not apply proportionately to larger fluctuations 
the company does not use derivative markets to speculate on the future direction of currency or commodity prices and does not sell forward any part of production from any business segment 
interest and currency swaps may be used within limits to manage the interest rate or currency exposure of the company s debt  but no such swap contracts have been used in the past three years 
the following table shows the estimated annual effect  under current conditions  of certain sensitivities of the company s after tax earnings 
millions of dollars after tax three dollars us a barrel change in crude oil prices sixty cents canadian a thousand cubic feet change in natural gas prices one cent canadian a litre change in sales margins for total petroleum products two cents us a pound change in sales margins for polyethylene one quarter percent decrease increase in short term interest rates six cents decrease increase in the value of the canadian dollar versus the us dollar the sensitivity to changes in the value of the canadian dollar versus the us dollar has increased from the year by about million after tax per year for each one canadian cent difference 
this is a result of the higher prices for crude oil  bitumen  natural gas and petroleum products denominated in us dollars at year end compared to year end the sensitivity to changes in interest rates reflects a change in both us and canadian short term interest rates  which reflects the company s current funding arrangements 
per unit sensitivities for other factors are generally unchanged from the year
