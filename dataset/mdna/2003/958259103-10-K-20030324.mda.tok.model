item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis relates to factors that have affected our consolidated financial condition and results of operations for the three years ended december   and certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the presentation used in reference should also be made to our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto and the selected financial data included elsewhere in this form k

net income decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the decrease in net income is primarily attributable to significantly lower gas and ngl prices in this period as compared to the prior year and lower margins per unit earned on our sales of natural gas 
these decreases more than offset increased production from the powder river basin coal bed methane development 
revenues from the sale of gas decreased million to billion for the year ended december  compared to this decrease was primarily due to a decline in product prices  which more than offset an increase in sales volume in the year ended december  average gas prices realized by us decreased per mcf to per mcf in the year ended december  compared to included in the realized gas price were approximately million of gains recognized in the year ended december  related to futures positions on equity gas volumes 
we have entered into additional futures positions for the majority of our equity gas for see further discussion in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
average gas sales volumes increased minimally to  mmcf per day in the year ended december  compared to on june   and as amended on june   we responded to a data request of the ferc in docket no 
pa the ferc s request inquired as to any wash  round trip  or sell  buy back trading in the united states portion of the western states coordinating council and or texas during the years ended december  and during this time period  we engaged in two transactions that met the ferc s criteria for a transaction of this type 
the transactions occurred in april and involved an aggregate quantity of approximately  mmbtu or million of gross revenue 
the transactions were not entered into for the purpose of artificially inflating our sales volume or revenue 
our internal control policies require valuation of the current market value of gas placed in storage based upon objective criteria  and these transactions were intended to provide a third party generated price for natural gas placed in storage 
these transactions represented of our total sales revenues for the year ended december  the ferc has not inquired as to sales activity in however  during  no transactions of this type are included in our revenues 
revenues from the sale of ngls decreased approximately million to million in the year ended december  compared to this decrease is due to a reduction in product prices and to a reduction in sales volume 
average ngl prices realized by us decreased per gallon to per gallon in the year ended december  compared to included in the realized ngl price were approximately million of losses recognized in the year ended december  related to futures positions on equity ngl volumes 
we have entered into additional futures positions for a portion of our equity ngl production for see further discussion in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
average ngl sales volumes decreased mgal per day to  mgal per day in the year ended december  compared to product purchases decreased by million for the year ended december  compared to primarily as a result of the decrease in commodity prices 
overall  combined product purchases as a percentage of sales of all products decreased to for the year ended december  from for the decrease in the product purchase percentage for the year ended december  versus resulted from a decrease in product prices and an increase of sale of our production from the powder river basin development 
marketing margins on residue gas averaged and per mcf in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in margin for compared to primarily resulted from reduced margins associated with the mark to market of forward transactions in the current year versus the prior year 
this reduction in margin is primarily the result of our electing hedge accounting on several of our transactions in utilizing our firm transportation capacity and fewer long dated transactions utilizing our transportation capacity in place at the end of compared to under hedge accounting  the margin to be realized on a transaction is recorded in the month the transportation capacity is used and under mark to market accounting  the anticipated margin on a transaction to be realized over the term of the transaction is recorded in the month of origination 
marketing margins on ngls averaged approximately per gallon in the year ended december  this represents an increase as compared to the per gallon realized in this is due to more favorable market conditions that were present in as compared to in the year ended december   we expensed a total of million for doubtful accounts  primarily due to the bankruptcy filing of a large mid western co op during the year 
this compares to an expense of million for doubtful accounts in these charges are not included in the calculation of the marketing margins and are reported in selling and administrative expenses 
plant and transportation operating expense increased by million in the year ended december  compared to this increase was primarily due to additional leased compression  repair and maintenance and labor costs in the powder river basin coal bed development and higher property tax expenses at our plant facilities 
oil and gas exploration and production expenses increased by million in the year ended december  as compared to in our operating areas  the significant reduction in residue gas prices in the periods resulted in substantially lower severance tax expenses 
these reductions were substantially offset by increased lease operating expenses  or loe  in the powder river basin coal bed development 
overall  loe averaged per mcf in the year ended december  loe in the powder river basin coal bed development averaged per mcf in the year ended december  this represents increases of per mcf and per mcf from the comparable periods in  respectively 
the increases are substantially due to higher utility charges  increased use of leased generators  increased labor charges and prior period adjustments for operating supplies  utilities and technical supervision billed to us by the well operator 
the increased loe in were substantially offset by lower severance taxes resulting from the significant reduction in residue gas prices in as compared to selling and administrative expenses increased by million in the year ended december  as compared to  due to higher health insurance costs and higher compensation expenses 
depreciation  depletion and amortization increased by million in the year ended december  as compared to primarily as a result of our increasing operations in the powder river basin coal bed methane development 
the provision for income taxes increased to a effective rate for the year ended december  from in this change is due to increased sales of third party product in states with higher corporate tax rates and in canada 
we expect that this increase in our effective tax rate will continue in future periods 
cash flow information cash flows from operating activities decreased by million in the year ended december  compared to this reduction was primarily due to a decrease in net income in compared to the prior year and the timing of cash receipts and payables 
cash flows used in investing activities decreased by million in the year ended december  compared to this decrease was primarily due to a reduction in capital expenditures 
cash flows used in financing activities increased by million in the year ended december  compared to this increase was due to the application of the proceeds received in the sale of our toca processing facility in to reduce the amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
other information preferred stock redemption 
in december  we redeemed all the remaining shares of our cumulative preferred stock currently outstanding  at a liquidation preference of per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends  for a total of approximately million 
the capitalized offering costs of  associated with the redeemed preferred stock are reflected as a special dividend to preferred shareholders in and reduced earnings available to common shareholders by approximately per common share 
toca processing facility 
in june  we entered into an agreement for the sale of our toca processing facility in louisiana 
this sale closed in september the sale price was million  subject to accounting adjustments  and resulted in a pre tax loss of approximately  the purchase price included a natural gas processing plant with a capacity of million cubic feet per day and a fractionator that can separate  barrels per day of mixed natural gas liquids into propane  normal butane  iso butane and natural gasoline 
the sale also includes ngl storage as well as truck  rail and barge loading facilities  which support the complex 
during the year ended december   this facility generated net after tax earnings of approximately  or 
per share of common stock  respectively 
we believe the results from this facility are immaterial for separate presentation as a discontinued operation 
approximately million of the proceeds received from this asset sale were initially used to reduce amounts outstanding on our revolving credit facility 
at december   the remaining amount of million was on deposit with a trustee in anticipation of the completion of a like kind exchange transaction and was reflected on the consolidated balance sheet under the caption other current assets 
these funds  along with additional amounts drawn on our revolving credit facility  were used in a january acquisition of several gathering systems 
bethel treating facility 
in december  we signed an agreement for the sale of all the outstanding stock of our wholly owned subsidiary  pinnacle gas treating  inc  or pinnacle  for million 
the only asset of this subsidiary was a mmcf per day treating facility and miles of associated gathering assets located in east texas 
the sale closed in january and resulted in a net pre tax gain for financial reporting purposes of million in the first quarter of transactions with officers 
in october  we granted options covering a total of  shares of our common stock to our ten executive officers 
the exercise price with respect to these options is per share 
in accordance with the terms of the stock option plan pursuant to which the options were granted  the option price is the average closing price for our common stock for the ten trading days prior to the grant 
in june  the compensation and nominating committee recommended  and the board approved  retention bonuses totaling  for nine of our executive officers 
these bonuses were contingent upon the officer not voluntarily terminating employment for one year following the hiring of a new chief executive officer and president 
these bonuses were paid on november  in  we loaned to our officers at that time  an amount sufficient to exercise their options under our stock option plans 
the loans and accrued interest were to be forgiven if the officer remained employed by us for specified time periods and upon a resolution of the board of directors 
during  we forgave loans totaling  related to the exercise of options covering  shares of common stock 
after giving effect to the forgiveness  a loan in the amount of  related to the exercise of options covering  shares of common stock remains outstanding 
pursuant to the terms of an agreement entered into in the second quarter of  the remaining loan will be forgiven in may in prior years  we have reserved for the forgiveness of these loans

net income increased million for the year december  compared to the increase in net income was primarily attributable to higher gas prices in compared to the prior year  increased production from the powder river basin coal bed methane development  and improved results from our marketing segment 
revenues from the sale of gas increased million to  million in the year ended december  compared to this increase was primarily due to an improvement in product prices and to a lesser extent from an increase in sales of natural gas purchased from third parties 
average gas prices realized by us increased per mcf to per mcf in the year ended december  compared to included in the realized gas price were approximately million of gains recognized in the year ended december  related to futures positions on equity gas volumes 
average gas sales volumes increased mmcf per day to  mmcf per day in the year ended december  compared to this increase in sales volume was primarily due to an increase in the sale of third party product 
revenues from the sale of ngls decreased approximately million in the year ended december  compared to this decrease was due to a reduction in sales volume and a decrease in product prices 
average ngl prices realized by us decreased per gallon to per gallon in the year ended december  compared to included in the realized ngl price were approximately million of gains recognized in the year ended december  related to futures positions on equity ngl volumes 
average ngl sales volumes decreased mgal per day to  mgal per day in the year ended december  compared to this decrease was primarily due to an intentional reduction in the sale of third party product as these types of sales were generating minimal margins 
also contributing to the reduction in overall sales volume was a decrease in the sale of product produced at our facilities as we did not recover ethane for a portion of due to low ethane prices 
product purchases increased by million in the year ended december  compared to overall  combined product purchases as a percentage of sales of all products decreased to approximately in the year ended december  from in the decrease in the product purchase percentage resulted from improved marketing margins and the intentional reduction in the sale of third party ngl products 
marketing margins on residue gas averaged per mcf in this represented a significant increase as compared to the per mcf marketing margin realized during the increase in margin for the year ended december  primarily resulted from volatility in gas prices  gains realized on our firm transportation capacity and from the mark to market of transactions utilizing a portion of this firm transportation capacity primarily during and the mark to market of storage transactions for the winter season ending in march under mark to market accounting  which we adopted on january   the margin to be realized over the term of the transaction is recorded in the month of origination 
of the total margin earned in the marketing segment of million  approximately million resulted from the portion of sales transactions beyond including the marking to market at december  of our derivative positions as required by sfas no 
this margin is included in the financial statement caption non cash change in fair value of derivatives 
marketing margins on ngls averaged approximately per gallon in the year ended december  this represents a decrease as compared to the margin realized during of per gallon 
this decrease has resulted in our decision to intentionally reduce the sale of third party ngl products 
on december   enron corp 
and many of its affiliates and subsidiaries filed a petition for bankruptcy protection under chapter of the bankruptcy code in the southern district of new york 
at the time of enron s filing  our exposure to it totaled approximately million 
this amount includes the net exposure from physical gas transactions of  which is comprised of physical gas sales of million and physical gas purchases of million 
we have in place a netting agreement with enron for the purchase and sale of physical gas 
although bankruptcy courts have upheld similar netting agreements in the past  we can provide no assurance that our agreement will not be challenged or the outcome of any challenge 
the remaining million of net exposure is under a master swap agreement related to derivative transactions 
as a result  we incurred an additional charge to income of million in this exposure to enron is not included in the calculation of the marketing margins and is primarily reported in selling and administrative expenses 
plant and transportation operating expense increased million in compared to this increase was primarily due to additional leased compression in the powder river basin coal bed development and higher fuel costs at our plant facilities 
oil and gas exploration and production expenses increased by million in as compared to the increase in the period is primarily as a result of our overall increasing operations in the powder river basin coal bed methane development 
depreciation  depletion and amortization increased by million for the year ended december  as compared to  primarily as a result of our increasing operations in the powder river basin coal bed methane development 
extraordinary charge for early extinguishment of debt decreased for the year ending december  as compared to as a result of an after tax charge of million incurred in third quarter of in september  we prepaid million of outstanding indebtedness originally due to be paid in november  with funds available under our revolving credit facility 
in connection with this prepayment  we paid a pre tax make whole payment of approximately million and expensed capitalized fees of approximately  other information preferred stock redemption 
on november   we issued a notice of redemption for approximately  shares of our cumulative preferred stock at its liquidation preference 
this totaled million including accrued and unpaid dividends 
the redemption date was december  and was funded with amounts available under our revolving credit facility 
the pro rata capitalized offering costs of  associated with the redeemed preferred stock were reflected as a special dividend to preferred shareholders in and  accordingly  reduced earnings available to common shareholders by approximately per common share 
bethel treating facility 
in december  we signed an agreement with anadarko petroleum corporation for the sale of all the outstanding stock of our wholly owned subsidiary  pinnacle  for million 
the only asset of this subsidiary was a mmcf per day treating facility and miles of associated gathering assets located in east texas 
the sale closed in january and resulted in an approximate pre tax gain for financial reporting purposes of million in the first quarter of arkoma 
in august  we sold our arkoma gathering system in oklahoma for gross proceeds of million 
this sale resulted in a pre tax gain of million 
western gas resources california  inc in january  we sold all the outstanding stock of our wholly owned subsidiary  wgr california  for million 
the only asset of this subsidiary was a mile pipeline in the sacramento basin of california 
wgr california acquired the pipeline through the exercise of a purchase option in a transaction that closed immediately prior to the sale by us of wgr california 
we recognized a pre tax gain on the sale of approximately million in the first quarter of the proceeds from these sales were used to reduce borrowings outstanding on the revolving credit facility 
westana 
in february  we acquired the remaining interest in the westana gathering company for a net purchase price of million 
the results from our ownership through february of a equity interest in the westana gathering company are reflected in revenues in other on the consolidated statement of operations 
beginning in march  the results of these operations have been fully consolidated and are included in revenues and costs and expenses 
additionally  in march  our investment in the westana gathering company was reclassified from other assets to property and equipment 
granger complex 
in may  we acquired the remaining interest in a portion of the bird canyon gathering system serving the granger complex for a net purchase price of million in cash and the settlement of previously disclosed litigation 
in september  we signed an agreement with questar gas management company for the sale of a interest in a segment of the bird canyon gathering system along with associated field compression for million 
this sale closed in october these assets were reclassified on the consolidated balance sheet to assets held for sale at september   and a  pre tax loss on the excess of the net book value over the sales price of these assets was recognized in the third quarter of also in october  both questar and western contributed their respective interests in the bird canyon system along with additional field compression and gathering dedications for gas produced along the pinedale anticline to a newly formed joint venture named rendezvous 
each company owns a interest in rendezvous  and we serve as field operator of its systems 
our interest in rendezvous is accounted for under the equity method 
critical accounting policies the application of accounting policies is an important process that has developed as our business activities have evolved and as accounting rules have developed 
accounting rules generally do not involve a selection among alternatives  but involve an interpretation and implementation of existing rules  and the use of judgment  to the specific set of circumstances existing in our business 
we make every effort to properly comply with all applicable rules on or before their adoption  and we believe the proper implementation and consistent application of the accounting rules is critical 
our critical accounting policies and estimates are discussed below 
for further details on our accounting policies  and the estimates  assumptions and judgments we use in applying these policies and a discussion of new accounting rules  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
use of estimates 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported for assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the amounts reported for revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates are evaluated on an ongoing basis  utilizing historical experience  consultation with experts and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances 
however  actual results may differ significantly from the estimates used 
any effects on our business  financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates will be recorded in the period in which the facts that necessitate a revision become known 
property and equipment 
our property and equipment is recorded at the lower of cost  including capitalized interest  or estimated realizable value 
interest incurred during the construction period of new projects is capitalized and amortized over the life of the associated assets 
depreciation on these assets is provided using the straight line method based on the estimated useful life of each facility which ranges from three to years 
useful lives are determined based on the shorter of our estimate of the life of the equipment or our estimate of the reserves serviced by the equipment 
among other factors  the estimates consider our experience with similar assets and technical analysis of the reserves 
the cost of acquired gas purchase contracts is amortized using the straight line method or units of production 
if the actual lives of the equipment or the reserves serviced by the equipment were less than we originally estimated  we may be required to record a loss upon retirement of a specific asset 
oil and gas properties and equipment 
we follow the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and production activities 
acquisition costs  development costs and successful exploration costs are capitalized when incurred 
exploratory dry hole costs  lease rentals and geological and geophysical costs are charged to expense as incurred 
upon surrender of undeveloped properties  the original cost is charged against income 
producing properties and related equipment are depleted and depreciated by the units of production method based on estimated proved reserves 
the unit of production method is sensitive to the determination of proved reserves 
we utilize technical analysis and outside expertise annually to determine the reserves associated with our oil and gas properties 
to the extent the reserves are modified based on this review  the depletion determined under the units of production method will be increased or decreased on a prospective basis 
impairment of long lived assets 
if changes in the expected performance of an asset occur  or if overall economic conditions warrant  we will review our assets to determine their economic viability 
this review is completed at the plant facility  the related group of plant facilities or the oil and gas producing property level 
in order to determine whether an impairment exists  we compare the net book value of the asset to the estimated fair market value or the undiscounted expected future net cash flows  determined by applying future prices estimated by management over the shorter of the lives of the facilities or the reserves supporting the facilities 
if an impairment exists  write downs of assets are based upon expected future net cash flows discounted using an interest rate commensurate with the risk associated with the underlying asset 
this analysis is sensitive to  among other things  management s expectation of commodity prices  operating costs  drilling plans and production rates 
identification of derivatives and mark to market valuations 
the determination of which contractual instruments meet the definition of a derivative under accounting rules is subject to differing interpretations as is the valuation of those derivatives 
management uses its judgment to analyze all contracts to determine whether or not they qualify as derivatives and to determine their value 
specific areas in which management s judgment is required includes identifying contracts meeting the criteria for exclusions from derivatives treatment  market liquidity  and market valuation 
this analysis is sensitive to commodity prices  outside market factors and management s intent upon entering into these contracts 
significant risks 
we are subject to a number of risks inherent in the industry in which we operate  including price volatility  counter party credit risk  the success of our drilling programs and other gas supply 
our financial condition and results of operations will depend significantly upon the prices we receive for gas and ngls 
these prices are subject to fluctuations in response to changes in supply and demand and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control 
in addition  we must continually connect new wells to our gathering systems in order to maintain or increase throughput levels to offset natural declines in dedicated volumes 
the number of new wells drilled will depend upon  among other factors  prices for gas and oil  the drilling budgets of third party producers  the energy policy of the federal government and the availability of foreign oil and gas  none of which are within our control 
recently issued accounting pronouncements 
we continually monitor and revise our accounting policies as new rules are issued 
at this time  there are several new accounting pronouncements that have recently been issued  but not yet adopted  which will have an impact on our accounting when these rules become effective in see further discussion in note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
business strategy maximizing the value of our existing core assets is the focal point of our business strategy 
our core assets are our fully integrated upstream and midstream assets in the powder river and green river basins in wyoming and our midstream operations in west texas and oklahoma 
our long term business plan is to increase shareholder value by i doubling proven reserves and equity production of natural gas from the levels achieved in over a three to five year period  ii meeting or exceeding throughput projections in our midstream operations  and iii optimizing annual returns 
liquidity and capital resources our sources of liquidity and capital resources historically have been net cash provided by operating activities  funds available under our financing facilities and proceeds from offerings of debt and equity securities 
in the past  these sources have been sufficient to meet our needs and finance the growth of our business 
we can give no assurance that the historical sources of liquidity and capital resources will be available for future development and acquisition projects  and we may be required to seek alternative financing sources 
product prices  sales of inventory  the volumes of natural gas processed by our facilities  the volume of natural gas produced from our producing properties  the margin on third party product purchased for resale  as well as the timely collection of our receivables will all affect future net cash provided by operating activities 
additionally  our future growth will be dependent upon obtaining additions to dedicated plant reserves  acquisitions  new project development  marketing results  efficient operation of our facilities and our ability to obtain financing at favorable terms 
during the past several years  although some of our plants have experienced declines in dedicated reserves  overall we have been successful in connecting additional reserves to more than offset the natural declines 
during  some producers in the rocky mountain region have curtailed existing production or delayed their drilling programs due to lower prices resulting from limited transportation capacity out of the region 
the overall level of drilling will depend upon  among other factors  the prices for oil and gas  the drilling budgets of third party producers  availability of transportation capacity to market centers  the energy and environmental policy and regulation by governmental agencies  and the availability of foreign oil and gas  none of which is within our control 
there is no assurance that we will continue to be successful in replacing the dedicated reserves processed at our facilities 
any prolonged reduction in prices for natural gas and ngls may depress the levels of exploration  development and production by third parties and us 
lower levels of these activities could result in a corresponding decline in the demand for our gathering  processing and treating services 
a reduction in any of these activities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe that the amounts available to be borrowed under the revolving credit facility  together with net cash provided by operating activities  will provide us with sufficient funds to connect new reserves  maintain our existing facilities  complete our current capital expenditure program and make any scheduled debt principal payments through we have from time to time renegotiated the revolving credit facility to extend the maturities of the facility  and we intend to re syndicate this facility and extend its maturity during the first quarter of this new facility will reflect the current bank market and will likely result in a higher interest rate 
depending on the timing and the amount of our future projects  and our ability to renegotiate the facility  we may be required to seek additional sources of capital 
our ability to secure such capital is restricted by our financing facilities  although we may request additional borrowing capacity from our lenders  seek waivers from our lenders to permit us to borrow funds from third parties  seek replacement financing facilities from other lenders  use stock as a currency for acquisitions  sell existing assets or a combination of alternatives 
while we believe that we would be able to secure additional financing  if required  we can provide no assurance that we will be able to do so or as to the terms of any additional financing 
we also believe that cash provided by operating activities and amounts available under the revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet scheduled principal repayments during of million under the master shelf agreement and our preferred stock dividend requirements during of approximately million 
we have effective shelf registration statements filed with the sec for an aggregate of million of debt securities and preferred stock  along with the shares of common stock  if any  into which those securities are convertible  and million of debt securities  preferred stock or common stock 
these shelf registrations allow us to access the debt and equity markets without the requirement of further sec review 
our sources and uses of funds for the year ended december  are summarized as follows dollars in thousands sources of funds borrowings under the revolving credit facility  proceeds from the dispositions of property and equipment  net cash provided by operating activities  proceeds from exercise of common stock options  total sources of funds  uses of funds payments related to long term debt including debt issue costs capital expenditures  preferred dividends paid  common dividends paid  redemption of cumulative perpetual preferred stock  contributions to equity investees  total uses of funds  capital investment program 
our capital expenditures totaled approximately million during with approximately invested in the rocky mountain region 
overall  capital expenditures in consisted of the following i approximately million related to gathering  processing  treating and pipeline assets  including million for maintaining existing facilities  ii approximately million related to exploration and production and lease acquisition activities  iii approximately million for information technology  and iv approximately million for capitalized overhead and interest 
overall  capital expenditures in the powder river basin coal bed methane development and in the green river basin in southwest wyoming operations represented and  respectively  of the total capital expenditures in in  we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately million 
overall  the capital budget consists of the following i approximately million related to gathering  processing  treating and pipeline assets  including million for maintaining existing facilities  ii approximately million related to exploration and production and lease acquisition activities  iii million for the acquisition of gathering systems which closed in january  iv approximately million for information technology and other items and v million for capitalized interest and overhead 
overall  capital expenditures in the powder river basin coal bed methane development and in southwest wyoming operations represent and  respectively  of the total budget 
due to drilling and regulatory uncertainties that are beyond our control  we can make no assurance that our capital budget for will not change 
we anticipate that funds for the capital budget will be provided primarily by internally generated cash flow  from the proceeds from the sale of our toca facility in the fourth quarter of and from amounts available under our revolving credit facility 
this budget may be further increased to provide for acquisitions if approved by our board of directors 
contractual commitments and obligations contractual cash obligations 
a summary of our contractual cash obligations as of december  is as follows dollars in thousands payments by period type of obligation total obligation due in due in due in due thereafter guarantee of fort union project financing   operating leases      firm transportation capacity and gathering agreements   firm storage capacity agreements     long term debt      total contractual cash obligations    guarantee of fort union project financing 
in  we joined with other industry participants to form fort union to construct a mile long  inch gathering pipeline and treater to gather and treat natural gas in the powder river basin in northeast wyoming 
we own a equity interest in fort union and are the construction manager and field operator 
construction of the gathering header and treating system was project financed by fort union and required a cash investment by us of approximately  in  an expansion of fort union was completed 
the expansion costs totaled approximately million and were also project financed by fort union 
this debt is amortizing on an annual basis and is scheduled to be fully paid in in  we invested approximately  as an equity contribution to fort union in conjunction with the project financing 
all participants in fort union have guaranteed fort union s payment of the project financing on a proportional basis  resulting in our guarantee of million of the debt of fort union at december  this guarantee is not reflected on our consolidated balance sheet 
operating leases 
in the ordinary course of our business operations  we enter into operating leases for office space  office equipment  communication equipment and transportation equipment 
in addition  primarily to support our growing development in the powder river coal bed development  we have entered into operating leases for compression equipment 
payments made on these leases are a component of operating expenses and are reflected on the consolidated statement of operations and  as operating leases  are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheet 
as of december   we had leased a total of compression units 
these leases have terms ranging from two to ten years with return or fair market purchase options available at various times during the lease 
if we were to exercise the early buyout options on all leased equipment  these purchase options would require the capital expenditure of approximately million between the years of and at december   we had four compressor units under an interim leasing agreement 
these compressors will be added to the existing lease arrangements when the equipment is installed and in service 
in august  we entered into a seven year and nine month agreement for the lease of approximately  square feet of office space in denver  colorado 
the cumulative lease payments over the term of this agreement  which begins upon occupancy  will total approximately million 
our corporate offices were relocated to this space in march we also entered into a ten year agreement effective in january for the lease of approximately  square feet of office space in gillette  wyoming for our wyoming field operations 
the cumulative lease payments over the term of this agreement will total approximately million 
neither of these leases is included in the table presented above since neither was in effect at december  firm transportation capacity and gathering agreements 
access to firm transportation is also a significant element of our business strategy 
firm transportation ensures that our equity production has access to downstream markets and allows us to capture incremental profit when pricing differentials between physical locations occur 
as of december   we had contracts for approximately mmcf per day of firm transportation 
this amount represents our total contracted amount on many individual pipelines 
in many cases it is necessary to utilize sequential pipelines to deliver gas into a specific sales market 
in total  we have the capacity to transport mmcf per day of gas from the rocky mountain area to the mid continent 
this utilizes a total of approximately mmcf per day of firm capacity on four separate pipelines 
the total rate to transport this gas to the mid continent approximates per mcf 
our remaining firm capacity consists of mmcf per day to markets within the rocky mountains and mmcf per day contracted in various other markets throughout the country 
in addition  we hold mmcf per day of firm gathering capacity on the fort union gathering line 
a portion of this firm transportation capacity was contracted for use in our marketing operations 
for example  our marketing segment purchases gas in the rocky mountain region  transports this gas utilizing its mmcf per day of our firm transportation capacity to the mid continent  and resells the gas to various markets 
during  these types of transactions have been profitable as the price difference  or basis  between the rocky mountain and mid continent regions has exceeded the cost of transportation 
historically  to the extent these transportation contracts were acquired for our marketing segment  they were derivative contracts as defined by sfas no 
and are marked to market 
on october   the ferc s policy on capacity release expired 
after that date  companies are no longer able to re market transportation capacity at rates which exceed the maximum allowable rate permitted by the pipelines tariff 
on some pipelines  this reduces our ability to liquidate our position 
accordingly  the transportation contracts on these specific pipelines are no longer considered derivatives under sfas no 
and will not be marked to market 
on occasion we may elect to hedge the cash flows resulting from transactions utilizing this transportation capacity 
to the extent of these hedges the transactions are classified as cash flow hedges 
we expect that the fixed fees associated with our contracts for firm transportation capacity during will average approximately per mcf per day 
the associated contract periods range from one month to fourteen years 
under firm transportation contracts  we are required to pay the fees associated with these contracts whether or not the transportation is used 
firm storage capacity agreements 
we customarily store gas in underground storage facilities to ensure an adequate supply for long term sales contracts and to capture seasonal price differentials 
as of december   we had contracts in place for approximately bcf of storage capacity at various third party facilities 
the fees associated with these contracts during will average per mcf of annual capacity 
the associated contract periods have an average term of seventeen months 
at december   we held gas in our contracted storage facilities and in imbalances of approximately bcf at an average cost of per mcf compared to bcf at an average cost of per mcf at december  these positions are for storage withdrawals within the next fifteen months 
at the time that we place product into storage  we contract for the sale of that product  physically or financially  and do not speculate on the future value of the product 
we have also entered into a precedent agreement for bcf of annual capacity  for a term of ten years  for storage in a facility  which is not yet completed 
we anticipate the completion of the construction of this facility in when the facility is completed  we will enter into a storage agreement 
from time to time  we lease ngl storage space at major trading locations in order to store products for resale during periods when prices are favorable and to facilitate the distribution of products 
at december   we held ngls in storage at various third party facilities of  mgal  consisting primarily of propane and normal butane  at an average cost of per gallon compared to  mgal at an average cost of per gallon at december  long term debt revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility is with a syndicate of banks and provides for a maximum borrowing commitment of million consisting of an million day revolving credit facility  or tranche a  which matures on april   and a million revolving credit facility  or tranche b  which matures on march  at december   million was outstanding under this facility 
the revolving credit facility bears interest at certain spreads over the eurodollar rate  or the greater of the federal funds rate or the agent bank s prime rate 
we have the option to determine which rate will be used 
we also pay a facility fee on the commitment 
the interest rate spreads and facility fee are adjusted based on our debt to capitalization ratio and range from 
to 
at december   the interest rate payable on borrowings under this facility was approximately 
we are required to maintain a total debt to capitalization ratio of not more than  and a senior debt to capitalization ratio of not more than 
the agreement also requires a quarterly test of the ratio of ebitda excluding some non recurring items for the last four quarters  to interest and dividends on preferred stock for the same period 
this ratio must exceed to this facility also limits our ability to enter into operating leases and sale leaseback transactions 
this facility is guaranteed and secured via a pledge of the stock of all of our material subsidiaries 
we intend to enter into a new revolving loan arrangement in the first quarter of to replace the existing revolving credit facility 
our practice has been to replace our existing facility approximately one year prior to its final maturity date to ensure adequate sources of capital for our operations 
as proposed  this new facility will reflect the current bank market with the interest rate spreads and facility fee adjusted based on our debt to capitalization ratio and ranging from to 
while we believe that we will be able to secure a new revolving loan agreement  we can provide no assurance as to the pricing  terms and covenants of this new agreement 
master shelf agreement 
in december  we entered into a master shelf agreement with the prudential insurance company of america 
amounts outstanding under the master shelf agreement at december  are as indicated in the following table dollars in thousands issue date amount interest rate final maturity principal payments due october   october  single payment at maturity december   december  single payment at maturity october   october  single payment at maturity july   july   on each of july  through under our agreement with prudential  we are required to maintain a minimum tangible net worth equal to the sum of million plus of consolidated net earnings earned from january  plus of the net proceeds of any equity offerings after january   a total debt to capitalization ratio of not more than and a senior debt to capitalization ratio of not more than 
this agreement also requires a quarterly test of the ratio of ebitda excluding some non recurring items for the last four quarters  to interest for the same period 
this ratio must exceed to the agreement also provides for a maximum ratio of senior debt to ebitda of to in addition  this agreement contains a calculation limiting dividends and other restricted payments including preferred stock redemptions 
under this limitation  approximately million was available for restricted payments at december  this facility also limits our ability to enter into operating leases and sale leaseback transactions 
the agreement provides for an annual fee of on the amounts outstanding on the master shelf agreement if we have not received an implied investment grade rating on our senior unsecured debt from moody s investors service or standard poor s and if the ratio of adjusted consolidated debt to ebitda as defined in the shelf for the period of four fiscal quarters most recently ended exceeds to under these terms  this fee is not currently being assessed 
borrowings under the master shelf agreement are guaranteed by  and secured via  a pledge of the stock of all of our material subsidiaries 
in october  we funded a required principal repayment under the master shelf agreement of million with funds available under the revolving credit facility 
during  we are required to make principal payments totaling million 
we intend to fund these with amounts available under the revolving credit facility 
on january   we borrowed an additional million under the master shelf agreement 
the note bears interest at and will be due in a single payment on january  we have the option to prepay the amount in full  at par on january  the funds we received from this borrowing were used in connection with our acquisition of gathering systems in january senior subordinated notes 
in  we sold million of senior subordinated notes in a private placement with a final maturity of due in a single payment which were subsequently exchanged for registered publicly tradeable notes under the same terms and conditions 
the subordinated notes bear interest at per annum and were priced at to yield 
these notes contain covenants  which include limitations on debt incurrence  restricted payments  liens and sales of assets 
under the calculation limiting restricted payments  including common dividends and preferred stock redemptions  approximately million was available at december  the subordinated notes are unsecured and are guaranteed on a subordinated basis by all our material subsidiaries 
we incurred approximately million in offering commissions and expenses  which were capitalized and are being amortized over the term of the notes 
covenant compliance 
we were in compliance with all covenants in our debt agreements at december  taking into account all the covenants contained in these agreements  we had approximately million of available borrowing capacity at december  none of our current credit facilities includes covenant requirements or acceleration provisions based upon a change in our credit ratings 
however  as proposed the new revolving loan arrangement that we expect to enter into will include a lien on our oil and gas properties that will spring into effect if the ratings on this specific loan are reduced to bb or below by standard poor s or to ba or below by moody s investors service 
redemption of preferred stock 
in december  we redeemed all the remaining shares of our cumulative preferred stock then outstanding  at a liquidation preference of per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends  for a total of million 
this redemption was funded with amounts available under our revolving credit facility 
environmental the construction and operation of our gathering systems  plants and other facilities used for the gathering  processing  treating or transporting of gas and ngls are subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations  including those that can impose obligations to clean up hazardous substances at our facilities or at facilities to which we send wastes for disposal 
in most instances  the applicable regulatory requirements relate to water and air pollution control or waste management 
we employ an environmental manager  a safety manager  four environmental engineers  three safety specialists and three regulatory compliance specialists to monitor environmental and safety compliance at our facilities 
in addition  on an ongoing basis  the environmental engineers perform environmental assessments of our existing facilities 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable material environmental laws and regulations 
environmental regulation can increase the cost of planning  designing  constructing and operating our facilities 
we believe that the costs for compliance with current environmental laws and regulations have not had and will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
prior to consummating any major acquisition  our environmental engineers perform audits on the facilities to be acquired 
in conducting this audit on the gathering systems acquired from epfs  in january  we identified many well sites that include underground sump tanks  pits  or tinhorns that are not properly permitted according to wyoming oil and gas conservation commission  or wyogcc  regulations 
we have reported these violations to wyogcc and are providing it with our remediation plan 
it is our intention to remove all these underground facilities over the next several months 
based on our discussions with wyogcc  it is our belief that it will not pursue any type of fines or penalties from us related to these assets 
we believe the cost of our remediation plan will approximate million  and epfs has established an escrow account in that amount to reimburse us for these and other costs 
in addition  at the time of the acquisition  we obtained an insurance policy that we believe will cover any additional environmental issues that may be identified over the next three years associated with these assets  up to a total exposure of million 
the texas council on environmental quality  which has authority to regulate  among other things  stationary air emissions sources  has created a committee to make recommendations to it regarding a voluntary emissions reduction plan for the permitting of existing grand fathered air emissions sources within texas 
a grand fathered air emissions source is one that does not need a state operating permit because it was constructed prior to we operate a number of these sources within texas  including portions of our midkiff benedum  gomez and mitchell puckett systems 
in connection with a modernization program  which was completed in march  we replaced the majority of our grand fathered equipment in texas 
we believe that the potential cost of complying with these regulations for our remaining grand fathered equipment will not have material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position 
we anticipate that the trend in environmental legislation and regulation will continue to be toward stricter standards 
federal regulations regarding spill prevention and containment have recently been modified to establish a lower threshold of storage capacity of petroleum and petroleum by products at a site for which a spill prevention plan is required 
we are evaluating all our assets for compliance with this regulation and estimate that approximately existing sites will need to be modified to meet the new requirements 
we currently estimate our costs for compliance to be approximately million 
the new spill prevention plans must be in place for covered assets by april all modifications called for in those plans must be in place by august we are unaware of any other future environmental standards that are reasonably likely to be adopted that will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations  but we cannot rule out that possibility 
we are in the process of voluntarily cleaning up substances at certain facilities that we operate 
our expenditures for environmental evaluation and remediation at existing facilities have not been significant in relation to our results of operations and totaled approximately million for the year ended december   including approximately  in air emissions fees to the states in which we operate 
although we anticipate that such environmental expenses per facility will increase over time  we do not believe that such increases will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our commodity price risk management program has two primary objectives 
the first goal is to preserve and enhance the value of our equity volumes of gas and ngls with regard to the impact of commodity price movements on cash flow  net income and earnings per common share in relation to those anticipated by our operating budget 
the second goal is to manage price risk related to our gas  crude oil and ngl marketing activities to protect profit margins 
this risk relates to fixed price purchase and sale commitments  the value of storage inventories and exposure to physical market price volatility 
we utilize a combination of fixed price forward contracts  exchange traded futures and options  as well as fixed index swaps  basis swaps and options traded in the over the counter  or otc  market to accomplish these goals 
these instruments allow us to preserve value and protect margins because corresponding losses or gains in the value of the financial instruments offset gains or losses in the physical market 
we use futures  swaps and options to reduce price risk and basis risk 
basis is the difference in price between the physical commodity being hedged and the price of the futures contract used for hedging 
basis risk is the risk that an adverse change in the futures market will not be completely offset by an equal and opposite change in the cash price of the commodity being hedged 
basis risk exists in natural gas primarily due to the geographic price differentials between cash market locations and futures contract delivery locations 
we enter into futures transactions on the new york mercantile exchange  or nymex  and through otc swaps and options with various counter parties  consisting primarily of financial institutions and other natural gas companies 
we conduct our standard credit review of otc counter parties and have agreements with many of these parties that contain collateral requirements 
we generally use standardized swap agreements that allow for offset of positive and negative exposures 
otc exposure is marked to market daily for the credit review process 
our otc credit risk exposure is partially limited by our ability to require a margin deposit from our major counter parties based upon the mark to market value of their net exposure 
we are subject to margin deposit requirements under these same agreements 
in addition  we are subject to similar margin deposit requirements for our nymex counter parties related to our net exposures 
beginning in  the prices for natural gas  crude oil and ngl products have increased significantly 
for example  the nymex contract for march delivery of natural gas closed at per mmbtu as compared to per mmbtu for the march nymex contract 
primarily as a result of our equity hedge positions for natural gas and liquid products  we have posted margin totaling million with various counter parties at march  we continually monitor and review the credit exposure to our marketing counter parties 
as prices have increased  throughout the winter of  we have become increasingly concerned with our counter party credit exposure 
as a result  we have reduced our sales of third party natural gas volumes to reduce our credit exposure 
during  we incurred a total expense of million for uncollectible accounts 
this represents of our total consolidated revenues of billion for the year ended december  additionally  beginning in  we became increasingly concerned with our credit exposure to our customers  primarily a category of our customers generally known as energy merchants 
energy merchants create liquidity in the marketplace for natural gas transactions and have historically been some of our largest suppliers and customers 
in order to minimize our credit exposures  we have utilized existing netting agreements to reduce our net credit exposure  established new netting agreements with additional customers  terminated several long term marketing obligations  negotiated accelerated payment terms with several customers  and reduced the amount of credit which we make available to various customers 
although similar netting agreements have been upheld by bankruptcy courts in the past  if any of these customers with whom we have netting agreements were to file for bankruptcy  we can provide no assurance that our agreements will not be challenged or as to the outcome of any challenge 
we have identified one master swap agreement containing ratings triggers 
under this agreement  either party may be required to post additional collateral in the event of a decrease in their current rating by standard poor s or moody s investors service 
based on our outstanding positions under this agreement and our counter party s credit rating at march   we were holding approximately million of collateral 
the use of financial instruments may expose us to the risk of financial loss in some circumstances  including instances when i our equity volumes are less than expected  ii our customers fail to purchase or deliver the contracted quantities of natural gas or ngls  or iii our otc counter parties fail to perform 
to the extent that we engage in hedging activities  we may be prevented from realizing the benefits of favorable price changes in the physical market 
however  we are similarly insulated against decreases in these prices 
risk policy and control 
we control the extent of risk management and marketing activities through policies and procedures that involve the senior level of management 
on a daily basis  our marketing activities are audited and monitored by our independent risk oversight department  or iro 
this department reports to the chief financial officer  thereby providing a separation of duties from the marketing department 
additionally  the iro reports monthly to the risk management committee  or rmc 
this committee is comprised of corporate managers and officers and is responsible for developing the policies and guidelines that control the management and measurement of risk 
the rmc is also responsible for setting risk limits  including value at risk and dollar stop loss limits 
our board of directors approves the risk limit parameters and risk management policy 
hedge positions 
as of march   we have hedged approximately of our projected equity natural gas volumes and approximately of our estimated equity production of crude oil  condensate  and ngls 
these contracts are designated and accounted for as cash flow hedges 
as such  gains and losses related to the effective portions of the changes in the fair value of the derivatives are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of stockholders equity 
any gains or losses on these cash flow hedges are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations through product purchases when the hedged transactions occur 
gains or losses from the ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recognized currently in earnings through non cash change in the fair value of derivatives 
this ineffectiveness is primarily due to the use of crude oil swaps in hedging the variability in the sales price of butanes 
during  we recognized a total of  of loss from the ineffective portions of our hedges 
overall  our hedges are expected to continue to be highly effective under sfas in the future 
in the fourth quarter of  in order to properly align our hedged volumes of natural gas to our forecasted equity production for  we discontinued hedge treatment on financial instruments for mmcf per day 
as a result  a pre tax gain of  was reclassified into earnings in the fourth quarter of from other comprehensive income 
to qualify as cash flow hedges  the hedge instruments must be designated as cash flow hedges and changes in their fair value must correlate with changes in the price of the forecasted transaction being hedged so that our exposure to the risk of commodity price changes is reduced 
to meet this requirement  we hedge both the price of the commodity and the basis between that derivative s contract delivery location and the cash market location used for the actual sale of the product 
this structure attains a high level of effectiveness  insuring that a change in the price of the forecasted transaction will result in an equal and opposite change in the cash price of the hedged commodity 
we utilize crude oil as a surrogate hedge for butanes 
this typically results in an effective hedge as crude oil and butane prices historically have moved in tandem 
outstanding equity hedge positions and the associated basis for the following table details our hedge positions as of march  in order to determine the hedged price to the particular operating region  deduct the basis differential from the nymex price 
the prices for ngls do not include the cost of the hedges of approximately  product quantity and nymex or settlement price hedge of basis differential natural gas  mmbtu per day with an average price of per mmbtu 
 mmbtu per day with a minimum price of per mmbtu and an average maximum price of mmbtu 
mid continent  mmbtu per day with an average basis price of per mmbtu 
permian  mmbtu per day with an average basis price of per mmbtu 
rocky mountain  mmbtu per day with an average basis price of per mmbtu 
crude oil  barrels of crude oil per month with an average price of per barrel 
not applicable butanes  barrels of crude oil per month 
floor at per barrel 
crude oil is used as a surrogate for butanes 
not applicable propane  barrels per month 
average minimum and maximum price of per gallon and per gallon  respectively 
not applicable ethane  barrels per month 
average minimum and maximum price of per gallon and per gallon  respectively 
not applicable account balances related to equity and transportation hedging transactions at december  were million in current assets from price risk management activities  million in current liabilities from price risk management activities  million in deferred income taxes payable  net  and a million after tax unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of shareholders equity 
based on the commodity prices as of december   the after tax loss of million will be re classified from accumulated other comprehensive income to product purchases during the next twelve months 
natural gas derivative market risk 
as of december   we held a notional quantity of approximately bcf of natural gas futures  swaps and options extending from january to october with a weighted average duration of approximately six months 
this was comprised of approximately bcf of long positions and bcf of short positions in these instruments 
as of december   we held a notional quantity of approximately bcf of natural gas futures  swaps and options extending from january to october with a weighted average duration of approximately six months 
this was comprised of approximately bcf of long positions and bcf of short positions in these instruments 
crude oil and ngl derivative market risk 
as of december   we held a notional quantity of approximately  mgal of crude oil and ngl futures  swaps and options extending from january to december with a weighted average duration of approximately six months 
this was comprised of approximately  mgal of long positions and  mgal of short positions in these instruments 
as of december   we held a notional quantity of approximately  mgal of crude oil and ngl futures  swaps and options extending from january to december with a weighted average duration of approximately six months 
this was comprised of approximately  mgal of long positions and  mgal of short positions in these instruments 
as of december   we did not hold any ngl futures  swaps or options for settlement beyond as of december   the estimated fair value of the aforementioned crude oil and ngl options and swaps held by us was approximately million 
value at risk 
we measure market risk in our natural gas and liquid marketing portfolios using value at risk  var 
we define var as a measure of the maximum expected loss over a given horizon under normal market conditions 
var does not explicitly indicate potential realized losses 
var does  however  implicitly indicate a firm s potential realized loss if market conditions were to remain constant or if the portfolio is liquidated within the specified time period 
our calculations are derived from financial engineering association s var works using the variance co variance method 
we assume a one day holding period with a confidence level 
there is a out of business days chance that the portfolio loss will be less than a specified amount if the entire portfolio were liquidated the next day 
we began using this model for var in the third quarter of as of december   our var position for natural gas and liquid marketing portfolios was  this figure includes the risk related to our entire marketing portfolio of natural gas and liquid financial instruments and the related underlying physical transactions 
we also measure market risk by sensitivity valuations 
as of december   an increase in natural gas prices of would lead to an increase in the fair value of our marketing portfolio of million and an increase in crude oil prices of would lead to an increase in the fair value of our marketing portfolio of  to the extent that a transaction is not fully hedged or there is any hedge ineffectiveness  additional gains or losses associated with the transaction may be reported in future periods 
summary of derivative positions 
a summary of the change in our derivative position from december  to december  is as follows dollars in thousands fair value of contracts outstanding at december   decrease in value due to change in price  increase in value due to new contracts entered into during the period gains realized during the period from existing and new contracts  changes in fair value attributable to changes in valuation techniques fair value of contracts outstanding at december  a summary of our outstanding derivative positions at december  is as follows dollars in thousands fair value of contracts at december  source of fair value total fair value maturing in maturing in maturing in maturing thereafter exchange published prices   other actively quoted prices   other valuation methods   total fair value other actively quoted prices are derived from broker quotations  trade publications  and industry indices 
other valuation methods are the black scholes option pricing model utilizing prices and volatility obtained from broker quotations  trade publications  and industry indices 
foreign currency derivative market risk 
as a normal part of our business  we enter into physical gas transactions which are payable in canadian dollars 
we enter into forward purchases and sales of canadian dollars from time to time to fix the cost of our future canadian dollar denominated natural gas purchase  sale  storage  and transportation obligations 
this is done to protect marketing margins from adverse changes in the us and canadian dollar exchange rate between the time the commitment for the payment obligation is made and the actual payment date of such obligation 
as of december   the net notional value of such contracts was approximately million in canadian dollars  which approximates fair market value
