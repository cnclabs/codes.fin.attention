critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and follow general practices within the industry in which it operates 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions  and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources  when available 
the allowance for credit losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in our loan portfolio 
the allowance is based on two principles of accounting a statement on financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for contingencies  which requires that losses be accrued when they are probable of occurring and are estimable and b sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  which requires that losses be accrued when it is probable that the company will not collect all principal and interest payments according to the contractual terms of the loan 
the loss  if any  is determined by the difference between the loan balance and the value of collateral  the present value of expected future cash flows  or values observable in the secondary markets 
three basic components comprise our allowance for credit losses a specific allowance  a formula allowance and a nonspecific allowance 
each component is determined based on estimates that can and do change when the actual events occur 
the specific allowance is used to individually allocate an allowance to loans identified as impaired 
an impaired loan may show deficiencies in the borrower s overall financial condition  payment record  support available from financial guarantors and or the fair market value of collateral 
when a loan is identified as impaired a specific reserve is established based on the company s assessment of the loss that may be associated with the individual loan 
the formula allowance is used to estimate the loss on internally risk rated loans  exclusive of those identified as impaired 
loans identified as special mention  substandard  doubtful and loss  as well as impaired  are segregated from performing loans 
remaining loans are then grouped by type commercial  commercial real estate  construction  home equity or consumer 
each loan type is assigned an allowance factor based on management s estimate of the risk  complexity and size of individual loans within a particular category 
classified loans are assigned higher allowance factors than non rated loans due to management s concerns regarding collectibility or management s knowledge of particular elements regarding the borrower 
allowance factors grow with the worsening of the internal risk rating 
the nonspecific formula is used to estimate the loss of non classified loans stemming from more global factors such as delinquencies  loss history  trends in volume and terms of loans  effects of changes in lending policy  the experience and depth of management  national and local economic trends  concentrations of credit  quality of loan review system and the effect of external factors such as competition and regulatory requirements 
the nonspecific allowance captures losses whose impact on the portfolio have occurred but have yet to be recognized in either the formula or specific allowance 
management has significant discretion in making the judgments inherent in the determination of the provision and allowance for credit losses  including in connection with the valuation of collateral  a borrower s prospects of repayment  and in establishing allowance factors on the formula allowance and nonspecific allowance components of the allowance 
the establishment of allowance factors is a continuing exercise  based on management s continuing assessment of the global factors discussed above and their impact on the portfolio  and allowance factors may change from period to period  resulting in an increase or decrease in the amount of the provision or allowance  based upon the same volume and classification of loans 
changes in allowance factors will have a direct impact on the amount of the provision  and a corresponding effect on net income 
errors in management s perception and assessment of the global factors and their impact on the portfolio could result in the allowance not being adequate to cover losses in the portfolio  and may result in additional provisions or charge offs 
for additional information regarding the allowance for credit losses  refer to notes and to the consolidated financial statements and the discussion under the caption allowance for credit losses below 
results of operations the company reported net income of million for the year ended december   as compared to income of million for the year ended december  and income of million for the year ended december  income per basic share was for the year ended december   as compared to for and for income per diluted share was for  for and for the company enjoyed a return on average assets of and return on average equity of in  as compared to returns on average assets and average equity of and respectively in and and in the company recorded an income tax expense of million for  the first full year for which it recognized tax expense 
during  the company recorded thousand in income tax expense 
the company did not incur any income tax expense prior to the third quarter of during  the company recorded a provision for credit losses in the amount of thousand 
at december   the allowance for credit losses was million  as compared to million at december  the company had net charge offs of thousand in  less than of average loans 
during the year  the company contributed million in additional capital to the bank from funds provided through a line of credit obtained by the company and discussed later in this analysis 
the contributions were made to support the bank s growth and in order to maintain the bank s status as well capitalized as defined by regulatory guidelines 
net interest income and net interest margin net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets and the cost of funds supporting those assets 
earning assets are composed primarily of loans and investment securities 
the cost of funds represents interest expense on deposits  customer repurchase agreements and other borrowings 
noninterest bearing deposits and capital are other components representing funding sources 
changes in the volume and mix of assets and funding sources  along with the changes in yields earned and rates paid  determine changes in net interest income 
net interest income in was million compared to million in and million in the table labeled average balances  interest yields and rates and net interest margin shows the average balances and rates of the various categories of the company s assets and liabilities 
included in the table is a measurement of interest rate spread and margin 
interest spread is the difference between the rate earned on assets less the cost of funds expressed as a percentage 
while spread provides a quick comparison of earnings rates versus cost of funds  management believes that margin provides a better measurement of performance 
margin includes the effect of noninterest bearing liabilities in its calculation and is net interest income expressed as a percentage of total earning assets 
interest spread increased in from by basis points  from  however  margin decreased basis points  from 
the decrease in margin while the spread increased is attributable to changes in mix in both earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
while there was an increase of in average earning assets there was only an increase of in net interest income reflecting the decline in margin 
following the average balance tables is a rate volume analysis table that clearly demonstrates the significance of a much larger base of earning assets contributing to income while the margin declined 
the yield on earning assets decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december   and the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the average yield on loans fell basis points from to  following a decline of basis points from to these declines reflect the continued impact of the significant rate reductions effected by the federal reserve in the effect of the reductions in market rates continued through  reflecting the lagging repricing of the fixed rate portion of the loan portfolio and the reduction of rates on new fixed rate loans 
the investment portfolio yield declined from to by basis points as the bank maintained a portfolio of short term fixed rate securities and gnma pass through mortgage backed securities 
the yield on gnma securities declined as mortgage refinancing accelerated  resulting in earlier repayment of mortgage backed securities  and reinvestment of the proceeds at lower current market rates 
the decline in yield from to followed a decline of basis points from to the federal funds rate had fallen to by the end of and for averaged  basis points less than the average yield of for and basis points less than the average yield of 
in order to keep the investment portfolio short for liquidity and expectations that rates would start to move upward  and to obtain better short term yields  the bank invested million in interest bearing deposits with other banks  yielding  a relatively attractive rate given their short term nature and low risk  as compared to the rates offered on federal funds and treasury bills 
the decline in the yield on interest earning assets continues into following the federal reserve s november cut in the federal funds rate 
on the liability side  management aggressively reduced rates on deposit accounts 
the reduction in the rate on total interest bearing liabilities from to was basis points which compares to a reduction of basis points in the yield on earning assets over the same period 
this follows a reduction in the cost of funds of basis points from to the reduction in the rates paid by the bank reduced the average rate on the cost of funds below in the latter part of the cost of funds continued to decline into the first quarter of as management further reduced rates following the federal reserve s november cut and as a result of continued repricing of maturing certificates of deposit 
it is anticipated that any further reductions in interest rates will have a significant adverse effect on earnings as rates paid on interest bearing liabilities  which are as low as on now accounts  cannot continue to decline at the same rate as yields on loans and investments

as the table shows  the increases in net interest income in as compared to is due to the growth in the volume of earning assets  augmented by average rate related declines in interest expense 
for compared to  the increase in net interest income primarily resulted from increased volume of earning assets 
rate volume analysis of net interest income dollars in thousands compared with compared with total total due to increase due to increase volume due to rate decrease volume due to rate decrease interest earned on loans       investment securities interest bearing bank deposits federal funds sold total interest income       interest paid on now accounts savings and mma accounts certificates of deposit    customer repurchase agreements other borrowings total interest expense     net interest income      noninterest income noninterest income is exclusively from bank operations and represents primarily service charge income and fees on deposit relationships  security gains losses and gains on the sale of loans 
the emphasis management placed on noninterest income resulted in a increase in noninterest income from million in to million in noninterest income increased from to  from thousand to million 
the increase in noninterest income from to reflects the growth of the bank and expanded sources of noninterest income 
during the period the bank concentrated on expanding both its sba and residential mortgage lending activities  and in purchased bank owned life insurance contracts boli which produced non taxable income in of thousand 
bank owned life insurance is a whole life insurance policy on certain directors and officers of the bank with the bank as beneficiary in the event of death of the director or officer 
income is recognized as the appreciation in underlying cash surrender value and is not taxable under current tax regulations 
if the policy is redeemed for its cash value the appreciation in value becomes taxable 
boli is carried as an asset on the books of the bank under the category other assets 
the increase in noninterest income reflected an increase in deposit account service charges  which increased during  from thousand for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  deposit account service charges increased from thousand in to thousand in increases in deposit account charges reflect the increased number of accounts and also the lower interest rate environment 
as interest rates decline so do the earnings allowances which are used to offset service charges on demand deposit accounts so that an account  with the same activity  which paid no service charge when interest rates were high may currently be paying a charge because the earnings allowance is insufficient to cover activity charges 
the company is an active originator of sba loans and sells the insured portion of those loans at a premium 
income from this source increased from thousand in to thousand in during  the maximum loan eligible for an sba guarantee was reduced  contributing to a slow down in this activity during the fourth quarter of while it can not be certain  management does not expect that the reduced level of activity will significantly affect the growth the company has experienced in this source of income 
the company also originates residential construction and permanent loans on a pre sold basis  servicing released 
sales of these mortgage loans yielded gains of thousand in compared to thousand in the success of the mortgage program is directly affected by the low interest rate environment in and this source of income may decline when interest rates begin to rise 
other items in noninterest income increased in from thousand for the year ended december  to thousand for the same period in this category includes noninterest income fees such as documentation preparation and prepayment penalties 
also included in other noninterest income are sba loan servicing fees and income from boli  both new sources of income in income for the year ended december  was thousand from sba servicing fees and thousand from boli 
sba loan servicing income is expected to increase as the number of loans originated and serviced by the bank increases 
income from boli is expected to increase to thousand in and remain stable thereafter 
noninterest expense noninterest expenses were million in  a increase over the million noninterest expense in  which was a increase over noninterest expense of million in the increases in noninterest expense are consistent with the overall growth in assets of from december  to december   and management s internal expectations 
the most significant noninterest expense item is salaries and employee benefits  which were million for the year ended december  an increase of over the million for the year ended december   which reflected a increase over the million for in  the additional salary and benefit costs reflected the staffing of the new gaithersburg office and additional staffing in the loan and operations areas  required to keep pace with the growth of the bank  as well as compensation increases for existing staff 
increases in primarily reflected staffing of the k street office and normal annual compensation increases 
the increase in premises and equipment expenses of from to  million to million can be attributed to a full year of expenses for the k street office  opened in  the new gaithersburg office and a new operations center opened in january the new operations center was added to accommodate the growing activities of the bank 
other expenses increased from the year ended december  to the year ended december   including a increase in advertising expense from thousand in to thousand in  and a increase in outside data processing expense 
other expenses increased from million in to million in and increased from thousand in to million in in  the company expects that there will be a substantial increase in insurance premium expense upon renewal of policies  not only as a result of the growth of the company but also as a result of general increases in premiums since september  in future periods  noninterest expenses to which the company has not been subject to date  such as deposit insurance premiums which may be required as a result of declines in the reserve ratios of the deposit insurance funds  may have an adverse affect on the results of operations of the company 
income tax the company had income tax expense of million in compared to thousand in  resulting in an effective tax rate of and respectively 
in  the company recorded previously unrecorded deferred tax assets and began recognizing tax on its income on a fully taxable basis 
the company recognized no federal income tax expense during it is expected that the company will continue to record income tax expense based upon its taxable income in future years 
financial condition the company ended the year with total assets of million  an increase of from assets of million at december  at december  deposits were million as compared to million at december   an increase of 
gross loans were at million at december  as compared to million at december   an increase of 
other liabilities consisting of customer repurchase agreements  federal home loan bank fhlb borrowings and advances under the company s line of credit increased from million at december  to million at december  net loans increased from million at december  to million at december  other earning assets investment securities  federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits increased million or 
investment securities and other earning assets the company s investment securities portfolio is comprised primarily of u 
s 
treasury and agency securities with maturities not exceeding seven years  except mortgage pass through securities which have average expected lives of less than six years but contractual maturities of up to thirty years 
federal funds sold also represent a significant earning asset and are sold  on an unsecured basis  only to highly rated banks  in limited amounts both in the aggregate and to any one bank 
the investment portfolio balance averaged approximately million in compared to million in the increase in investment securities resulted from the strong growth in deposits and increased borrowings which occurred in the second half of the rate of growth in liabilities out paced loan growth during and excess funds were invested in the investment portfolio 
the following tables and note to the consolidated financial statements provide additional information regarding the company s investment securities 
the company classifies all investment securities as available for sale afs 
this method of accounting requires that investment securities be reported at their fair value and the difference between the fair value and amortized cost the purchase price adjusted by any accretion or amortization be reported in the equity section as accumulated other comprehensive income  net of deferred taxes 
at december   the company reported an unrealized gain in afs securities of thousand and at december   an unrealized gain in afs securities of thousand 
the accumulated comprehensive component of these unrealized gains was thousand and thousand respectively 
the company  except in a planned investment strategy or for liquidity needs  has no present plan or intention to sell these securities 
in  the bank began using excess liquidity to invest in certificates of deposit of other banks  which generally offer more favorable rates than traditional short term investment securities 
these deposits are in insured institutions  and are generally in amounts of thousand or less

loan portfolio in its lending activities  the bank seeks to develop sound credits with customers who will grow with the bank 
there has not been an effort to rapidly build the loan portfolio and earnings at the sacrifice of asset quality 
however  loan growth in  and was good with loans outstanding reaching million at december  from million at december   an increase of million or 
during  the bank became active in the origination and selling of both residential mortgage loans and the insured portion of sba loans 
in  in addition to the loans the bank held for its portfolio it originated approximately million in loans which were sold 
at december   there were million of loans held for sale and at december  there were million of such loans 
the bank is primarily business oriented in its development focus

demand loans  having no contractual maturity  and overdrafts are reported as due in one year or less 
allowance for credit losses the provision for credit losses represents the expense recognized to fund the allowance for credit losses 
the amount of the allowance for credit losses is based on many factors which reflect management s assessment of the risk in the loan portfolio 
those factors include economic conditions and trends  the value and adequacy of collateral  volume and mix of the portfolio  performance of the portfolio  and internal loan processes of the company and bank 
management has developed a comprehensive review process to monitor the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
the review process and guidelines were developed utilizing guidance from federal banking regulatory agencies 
the results of this review process  in combination with conclusions of the bank s outside loan review consultant  support management s view as to the adequacy of the allowance as of the balance sheet date 
during  a provision for credit losses was made in the amount of thousand before net charge offs of thousand 
a full discussion of the accounting for allowance for credit losses is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements  activity in the allowance for credit losses is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
please refer to the discussion under the caption  critical accounting policies for an overview of the underlying methodology management employs on a quarterly basis to maintain the allowance 
at december   the company had one loan classified as nonaccrual in the amount of thousand of which thousand was guaranteed by the sba 
there was one loan past due over ninety days and still accruing interest at december   in the amount of thousand 
both of these loans are considered impaired as defined by statement of financial accounting standards no 
please refer to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements under the heading loans for a discussion of the company s policy regarding impairment of loans 
as part of its comprehensive loan review process  the bank s board of director s loan committee and or board of directors credit review committee carefully evaluates loans over thirty days past due and considers if such loans should be classified as nonaccrual 
the committee s makes a thorough assessment of the conditions and circumstances surrounding each past due loan 
the bank s loan policy requires that loans be placed on nonaccrual if they are ninety days past due  unless they are well secured and in the process of collection 
after reviewing the circumstances surrounding the thousand loan  the credit review committee determined that it was appropriate to continue the accrual of interest 
the loan was extended to an automobile leasing company for the purpose of funding individual leases 
during  the loan became delinquent  and management worked with the borrower in efforts to return the loan to a current status 
during the third quarter of  management discovered that payments on the underlying leases were being diverted and not being used to service the loan as required by the loan agreement 
the bank exercised its rights under the loan agreement and instructed the lessees of the underlying leases to send all future lease payments directly to the bank under a lockbox arrangement 
the diversion of funds is believed to be the primary reason for the loan s delinquency 
subsequently  the borrower declared bankruptcy  however  the trustee assigned in the bankruptcy proceedings allowed the bank to continue to collect payments directly from the lessees 
in determining the accrual status of the loan  management and the credit review committee evaluated the expected cash flow of the leases  the current underlying collateral value of the leases and the residual value of the underlying vehicles at the end of the leases 
this evaluation resulted in a projected cash flow that was considered sufficient to amortize the net loan balance including interest 
a specific reserve of thousand was established for this loan 
as of december   this specific reserve had been reduced by thousand in charge offs resulting in a remaining specific reserve of thousand 
the provision for credit losses was thousand in compared to a provision for credit losses of thousand in the higher provision in was as a result of the economic uncertainties surrounding the events of september  which affected some of the qualitative and quantitative factors that are imbedded in the analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
the result of these factors was a provision that was thousand higher in than the provision recorded in the provision was affected by thousand in net charge offs and thousand in loans that were classified as impaired as of december  there were no loans classified as impaired during and the unallocated portion of the allowance to the total allowance remained consistent from december  to at and respectively 
as the portfolio and allowance review process matures  there will be changes to different elements of the allowance and this may have an effect on the overall level of the allowance maintained 
to date the bank has enjoyed a very high quality portfolio with minimal net charge offs and very low delinquency 
the maintenance of a high quality portfolio will continue to be management s prime objective as it relates to the lending process and to the allowance for credit losses 
management  aware of the strong loan growth experienced by the company and the problems which could develop in an unmonitored environment  is intent on maintaining a strong credit review system and risk rating process 
in january  the company established a credit department to perform interim analysis  manage classified credits and develop a credit scoring system for small business credits 
over time  this department will increase its review of credit analysis and processes 
the company is also reviewing its risk rating systems and is exploring the implementation of additional analytical procedures for risk ratings 
the entire loan portfolio analysis process is an ongoing and evolving practice directed at maintaining a portfolio of quality credits and quickly identifying any weaknesses before they become irremediable

deposits and other borrowings the principal sources of funds for the bank are core deposits  consisting of demand deposits  now accounts  money market accounts  savings accounts and relationship certificates of deposits  from the local market areas surrounding the bank s offices 
the bank also considers as part of its core deposits approximately million of deposits from a local customer with a longstanding relationship with the bank 
these deposits are required to be classified as brokered deposits for regulatory purposes 
the bank s deposit base includes transaction accounts  time and savings accounts and accounts which customers use for cash management and which provide the bank with a source of fee income and cross marketing opportunities as well as a low cost source of funds 
time and savings accounts  including money market deposit accounts  also provide a relatively stable and low cost source of funding 
one third of the bank s deposits are made up of certificates of deposits  which are generally the most expensive form of deposit because of their fixed term 
certificates of deposit in denominations of thousand or more can be more volatile and more expensive than certificates of less than thousand 
however  because the bank focuses on relationship banking and does not accept brokered certificates  its historical experience has been that large certificates of deposit have not been more volatile or significantly more expensive than smaller denomination certificates 
it has been the practice of the bank to pay posted rates on its certificates of deposit whether under or over thousand 
the bank has paid negotiated rates for deposits in excess of thousand but the rates paid have rarely been more than to basis points higher than posted rates and deposits have been negotiated at below market rates 
in late  to fund strong loan demand  the bank began accepting certificates of deposits  generally in denominations of less than thousand on a non brokered basis  from bank and credit union subscribers to a wholesale deposit rate line 
the bank has found rates on these deposits to be generally competitive with rates in our market given the speed and minimal noninterest cost at which deposits can be acquired  although it is possible for rates to significantly exceed local market rates 
at december  the bank held million of these deposits at an average rate of as compared to million of these deposits  at an average rate of at december  with the strong core deposit growth experienced by the bank in these deposits are being allowed to mature and may not be renewed 
however  the bank has found this source of funds to be an effective funds management tool and may accept more of these deposits in the future 
at december   the company had approximately million in noninterest bearing demand deposits  representing an increase from million in demand deposits at december  the percentage of demand deposits to total deposits from to rose by  from to 
these are primarily business checking accounts on which the payment of interest is prohibited by regulations of the federal reserve 
proposed legislation has been introduced in each of the last several congresses which would permit banks to pay interest on checking and demand deposit accounts established by businesses 
if legislation effectively permitting the payment of interest on business demand deposits is enacted  of which there can be no assurance  it is likely that we may be required to pay interest on some portion of our noninterest bearing deposits in order to compete with other banks

as an enhancement to the basic noninterest bearing demand deposit account  the company offers a sweep account  customer repurchase agreement  allowing qualifying businesses to earn interest on short term excess funds which are not suited for either a cd investment or a money market account 
the balances in these accounts were million at december   an increase over december  balance of million 
customer repurchase agreements are not deposits and are not fdic insured but are secured by us treasury and or us government agency securities 
these accounts are particularly suitable to businesses with significant change in the peaks and valleys of cash flow over a very short time frame often measured in days 
attorney and title company escrow accounts are an example of accounts which can benefit from this product  as are customers who may require collateral for deposits in excess of thousand but do not qualify for other pledging arrangements 
this program requires the company to maintain a sufficient investment securities level to accommodate the fluctuations in balances which may occur in these accounts 
at december   the company had drawn million against a line of credit provided by a correspondent bank as compared to million at december  these borrowings are principally to fund additions of capital to the bank in order to maintain its well capitalized ratio 
at december   the bank had million of fhlb borrowings  as compared to million at december  these advances are secured by us government agency securities and by a blanket lien on qualifying loans in the bank s commercial mortgage loan portfolio

the bank s sources of liquidity consist of cash balances  due from banks  loan repayments  federal funds sold and short term investments 
these sources of liquidity are supplemented by the ability of the company and bank to borrow funds 
during  the company increased an established line of credit  with a correspondent bank  from million to million  against which it had drawn million as of december  the bank can purchase up to million in federal funds on an unsecured basis and enter into reverse repurchase agreements up to million 
at year end  the bank was also eligible to take fhlb advances of up to million  of which it had advances outstanding of million 
the loss of deposits  through disintermediation  is one of the greater risks to liquidity 
disintermediation occurs most commonly when rates rise and depositors withdraw deposits seeking higher rates than the bank may offer 
the bank was founded under a philosophy of relationship banking and  therefore  believes that it has less of an exposure to disintermediation and resultant liquidity concerns than do banks which build an asset base on non core deposits and other borrowings 
the history of the bank  while only four and one half years  includes a period of rising interest rates and significant competition for deposit dollars 
during that period the bank grew its core business without sacrificing its interest margin in higher deposit rates for non core deposits 
there is  however  a risk that some deposits would be lost if rates were to spike up and the bank elected not to meet the market 
under those conditions the bank believes that it is well positioned to use other liability management instruments such as fhlb borrowing  reverse repurchase agreements and bank lines to offset a decline in deposits in the short run 
over the long term an adjustment in assets and change in business emphasis could compensate for a loss of deposits 
under these circumstances  further asset growth could be limited as the bank utilizes its liquidity sources to replace  rather than supplement  core deposits 
certificates of deposit acquired through the subscription service may be more sensitive to rate changes and pose a greater risk of disintermediation than deposits acquired in the local community 
the bank has limited the amount of such deposits to less than of total assets  an amount which it believes it could replace with alternative liquidity sources  although there can be no assurance of this 
the mature earning pattern of the bank is also a liquidity management resource for the bank 
the earnings of the bank are now at a level that allows the bank to pay higher rates to retain deposits over a short period  while it adjusts it asset base repricing to offset a higher cost of funds 
the cost of retaining business in the short run and the associated reduction in earnings can be preferable to reducing deposit and asset levels and restricting growth 
at year end  under the bank s liquidity formula  it had million of liquidity representing of total bank assets 
interest rate risk management asset liability management and quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk a fundamental risk in banking  outside of credit risk  is exposure to market risk  or interest rate risk  since a bank s net income is largely dependent on net interest income 
the bank s asset liability committee alco of the board of directors formulates and monitors the management of interest rate risk within policies established by it and the board of directors 
in its consideration of establishing guidelines for levels and or limits on market risk  the alco committee considers the impact on earnings and capital  the level and direction of interest rates  liquidity  local economic conditions  outside threats and other factors 
banking is generally a business of attempting to match asset and liability components to produce a spread sufficient to provide net income to the bank at nominal rate risk 
the company  through alco  continually monitors the interest rate environment in which it operates and adjusts rates and maturities of its assets and liabilities to meet the market conditions 
in the current low interest rate environment  the company is keeping its assets either variably priced or with short term maturities or short average lives 
at the same time it strives to attract longer term liabilities to lock in the lower cost of funds 
in the current market  due to competitive factors and customer preferences  the effort to attract longer term fixed priced liabilities has not been as successful as the company s best case asset liability mix would prefer 
when interest rates begin to rise  the company expects that it will seek to keep asset maturities and repricing periods short until rates appear to be nearing their top and then extend maturities to extend the benefit of higher rates 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully carry out this intention  as a result of competitive pressures  customer preferences and the inability to perfectly forecast future interest rates 
one of the tools used by the company to manage its interest rate risk is a static gap analysis presented below 
the company also uses an earning simulation model on a quarterly basis to closely monitor interest sensitivity and to expose its balance sheet and income statement to different scenarios 
the model is based on current company data and adjusted by assumptions as to growth patterns  noninterest income and noninterest expense and interest rate sensitivity  based on historical data  for both assets and liabilities 
the model is then subjected to a shock test assuming a sudden interest rate increase of basis points or a decrease of basis points  but not below zero 
the results are measured by the effect on net income 
the company  in its latest model  shows a positive effect on income when interest rates immediately rise basis points because of the short maturities of assets and a negative impact if rates were to decline further 
with rates already at historic lows  a further reduction would reduce income on earning assets which could not be offset by a corresponding reduction in the cost of funds 
the following table reflects the result of a shock test simulation on the december   earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the change in net interest income resulting from the simulated immediate increase and decrease in interest of and basis points 
also shown is the change in the market value portfolio equity resulting from the simulation 
the model as presented is projected for one year 
percentage change in change in interest percentage change percentage change market value of rates basis points in net interest income in net income portfolio equity certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or repricing periods  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgage loans  have features that restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the loan 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the tables 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of a significant interest rate increase 
gap banks and other financial institutions are dependent upon net interest income  the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities 
in falling interest rate environments  net interest income is maximized with longer term  higher yielding assets being funded by lower yielding short term funds  however  when interest rates trend upward this asset liability structure can result in a significant adverse impact on interest income 
the current interest rate environment is signaling steady to possibly higher rates 
management has for a number of months shortened maturities in the bank s investment portfolio and where possible also has shorten repricing opportunities for new loan requests 
while management believes that this will help minimize interest rate risk in a rising environment  there can be no assurance as to actual results 
gap  a measure of the difference in volume between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  is a means of monitoring the sensitivity of a financial institution to changes in interest rates 
the chart below provides an indicator of the rate sensitivity of the company 
a negative gap indicates the degree to which the volume of repriceable liabilities exceeds repriceable assets in particular time periods 
at december   the bank has a positive gap of out to three months and a cumulative negative gap of out to twelve months 
if interest rates were to continue to decline further  the bank s interest income and margin may be adversely effected 
because of the positive gap measure in the month period  continued decline in the prime lending rate will reduce income on repriceable assets within thirty to sixty days  while the repricing of liabilities will occur in later time periods 
this will cause a short term decline in net interest income and net income in a static environment 
management has carefully considered its strategy to maximize interest income by reviewing interest rate levels  economic indicators and call features of some of its assets 
these factors have been thoroughly discussed with the board of directors asset liability committee and management believes that current strategies are appropriate to current economic and interest rate trends 
the negative gap is carefully monitored and will be adjusted as conditions change

capital resources and adequacy the assessment of capital adequacy depends on a number of factors such as asset quality  liquidity  earnings performance  changing competitive conditions and economic forces  and the overall level of growth 
the adequacy of the company s current and future capital needs is monitored by management on an ongoing basis 
management seeks to maintain a capital structure that will assure an adequate level of capital to support anticipated asset growth and to absorb potential losses 
the capital position of the company s wholly owned subsidiary  the bank  continues to meet regulatory requirements 
the primary indicators relied on by bank regulators in measuring the capital position are the tier risk based capital  total risk based capital  and leverage ratios 
tier capital consists of common and qualifying preferred stockholders equity less goodwill 
total risk based capital consists of tier capital  qualifying subordinated debt  and a portion of the allowance for credit losses 
risk based capital ratios are calculated with reference to risk weighted assets 
the leverage ratio compares tier capital to total average assets 
at december   the company s and bank s capital ratios were in excess of the mandated minimum requirements 
the company s and bank s capital ratios are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
during  the company continued to borrow funds under a line of credit with a correspondent bank in order to provide capital to fund anticipated growth and expansion at the bank in excess of the growth permitted by reinvestment of earnings 
at december   the amount outstanding under the line of credit was million 
the ability of the company to continue to grow is dependent on its earnings and the ability to obtain additional funds for contribution to the bank s capital  through additional borrowing  the sale of additional common stock  the sale of preferred stock  or through the issuance of additional qualifying equity equivalents  such as subordinated debt or trust preferred securities 
the company is currently proposing to raise additional equity through the sale of additional shares of common stock 
to the extent that the company is unsuccessful in raising additional equity  it will be required to seek alternative sources  such as increased reliance on  or expansion of  its line of credit or the issuance of trust preferred securities 
increased borrowings or trust preferred securities will have an immediate interest cost  which will have an adverse impact on earnings  although they may require a lower internal rate of return on equity than common stock 
to the extent that they are floating or variable rate  the future cost of additional borrowings or trust preferred securities may increase over time  while the cost of equity will remain fixed 
in the event that the company is unable to obtain additional capital for the bank on a timely basis  the growth of the company and the bank may be curtailed  and the company and the bank may be required to reduce their level of assets in order to maintain compliance with regulatory capital requirements 
under those circumstances net income and the rate of growth of net income may be adversely affected 
impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of operations 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the price of goods or services
