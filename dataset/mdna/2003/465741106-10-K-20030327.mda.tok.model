for a more complete description of these and other risks  see certain risk factors 
overview we currently derive the majority of our revenues from sales of products and services to utilities 
however  our business may increasingly consist of sales to other energy and water industry participants such as energy service providers  end user customers  wholesale power market participants and others 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition sales consist of hardware  software license fees  custom software development  field and project management services  and engineering  consulting and installation services 
service revenues include post sale maintenance support and outsourcing services 
outsourcing services encompass installation  operation and maintenance of meter reading systems to provide meter information to a customer for billing and management purposes 
outsourcing services can be provided for systems we own as well as those owned by our customers 
the company recognizes revenues from hardware at the time of shipment  receipt  or  if applicable  upon completion of customer acceptance provisions 
revenues for software licenses  custom software development  field and project management services  engineering and consulting  installation  outsourcing and maintenance services are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for software arrangements with multiple elements  revenue is recognized dependent upon whether vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for each of the elements 
under outsourcing arrangements  revenue is recognized as services are provided 
hardware and software post contract customer support fees are recognized over the life of the related service contracts 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out method 
cost includes raw materials and labor  plus applied direct and indirect costs 
inventory is subject to rapidly changing technologies 
there can be no assurance that technological advances will not cause some or all of our inventory to become obsolete or uneconomical 
warranty the company offers standard warranty terms on most of our product sales of between one and three years 
a provision for estimated warranty costs is recorded at the time of sale and periodically adjusted to reflect actual experience 
the long term warranty provision covers estimated standard warranty cost for the second and third years of customer use and future expected costs of testing and replacement of radio meter module batteries and fixed network equipment 
management continually evaluates the sufficiency of warranty provisions and makes adjustments when necessary 
actual warranty costs may fluctuate and may be different than amounts accrued 
contingencies the company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims of which the outcomes are subject to significant uncertainty 
an estimated loss from a contingency is accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the company evaluates  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
changes in these factors could materially impact the company s financial position or its results of operations 
the company has been party to an ongoing legal dispute in regards to whether certain of its products infringe upon a third party patent 
the company has accrued million in the fourth quarter of in connection with the patent litigation 
the judge s future rulings could have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
because the jury found the company s infringement was willful  the court may treble the damages award and assess attorney s fees against the company 
based on other motions before the court  the court may also reduce the damages award 
final judgment is not expected to be entered until april or later 
the company is also evaluating grounds for appeal 
results of operations effective january   we realigned our organization from six business units  comprised of both customer segments and products  to four business units focused on the customer segments that we serve 
results from the former client services and energy information systems eis segments  which are now product groups  have been reclassified into our electric  natural gas  water public power  and international business units for and business unit results throughout this report have been reclassified to reflect our new organization 
revenues for each business unit consist of hardware  software license fees  custom software development  field and project management services  and engineering  consulting and installation services 
service revenues include post sale maintenance support and outsourcing services 
outsourcing services encompass installation  operation and maintenance of meter reading systems to provide meter information to a customer for billing and management purposes 
outsourcing services can be provided for systems we own as well as those owned by our customers 
inter segment revenues are immaterial 
segment cost of sales are based on standard costs which include materials  direct labor and an overhead allocation based on projected production for the year 
variances from standard costs are included in corporate cost of sales and are not allocated to the business units 
revenues and gross margins total company revenues and gross margins revenues for were million compared with million in and million in the higher revenues in principally reflect increased hardware deliveries to existing domestic customers in the form of electric  gas and water amr modules 
domestic revenues increased over the three companies acquired in contributed a combined million in revenue 
revenues declined in in our international markets and from our c i meter data collection and analysis software licenses 
revenue growth in of over was also primarily driven by increased hardware sales 
one customer represented and of total company revenues in and  respectively 
sales to this customer will continue through the fourth quarter of but will continue to decrease as a percentage of total company revenues 
our customer concentration in revenue was about the same in  the top ten customers accounted for of revenues  compared with in gross margins improved year over year  growing to in compared with in and in improved domestic margins from to resulted from a combination of factors  including improved manufacturing efficiencies from higher production volumes and changes in product mix  specific cost reduction efforts  lower general market prices for electronic components and other supply chain management initiatives 
service gross margins decreased in primarily due to a one time increase in costs associated with a long term service contract 
year ended december  change change in millions revenues sales service total revenues year ended december  change change gross margin sales service total gross margin segment revenues and gross margins the following tables and discussion highlights significant changes in trends or components of revenues and gross margin for each segment

electric net revenues in increased by million  or  compared with primarily as a result of increased hardware shipments 
also contributing to the increase in revenues were the three acquisitions in excluding the revenues from these acquisitions  revenue growth was compared to in  one customer represented of the electric business unit revenues and of total company revenues 
in  this customer represented of the electric business unit revenues and of total company revenues 
sales to this customer will continue through the fourth quarter of but will continue to decrease as a percentage of electric and total company revenues 
the improved electric segment margins resulted primarily from lower standard costs caused by higher production volumes and other manufacturing efficiencies  as well as a shift in the mix of products and services 
electric segment revenues in were higher than revenues and represented of total revenues 
the majority of this increase was due to continued shipments on the multi year contract with the one significant customer 
this customer represented of the electric business unit revenues and of total company revenues in gross margin decreased in compared to due to changes in the mix of customers and products 
natural gas net revenues increased by million  or  compared with primarily due to increased hardware shipments 
in  one customer represented of the natural gas business unit revenues and of total company revenues 
sales to this customer will continue through early under the current contractual obligation but will continue to decrease as a percentage of natural gas and total company revenues 
no revenues were generated from this customer in the improved natural gas segment margins resulted primarily from lower hardware costs caused by higher production volumes and other manufacturing efficiencies 
natural gas segment revenues declined in compared with  primarily due to the completion of large contracts in that were not replaced by similar business during water and public power net revenues increased by million  or  compared with as a result of increased hardware shipments and installation services 
sales through meter manufacturers and other indirect sales channels grew in while water and public power also benefited from higher hardware production volumes and manufacturing efficiencies  overall gross margins declined slightly due to increased lower margin installation sales as well as higher cost of service for our maintenance contracts 
water and public power segment revenues were million higher in compared with due to the initial deployment of modules for a multi year amr system for a new customer  the expansion of systems for existing customers  and increased shipments to meter manufacturers 
international net revenues decreased by million  or  compared with this decrease is primarily due to an million handheld meter reading system sale made to a customer in japan in  which was not replaced with a comparable size order in during the fourth quarter of  we announced plans to restructure the european operations to improve the long term profitability and efficiency of international operations 
while we anticipate improved profitability of international operations in  significant benefits from the restructuring efforts are not expected to be realized until after margins were slightly higher in compared with due to a shift in product mix 
international segment revenues in increased  or million  over due to the significant handheld sale to a customer in japan 
increased meter module sales in france and a large hardware installation of handheld sales in australia in the second half of the year also contributed to international revenue growth 
gross margins decreased from in to in  or 
the majority of this decrease was due to low margins on the large handheld shipments to japan 
in addition  we had more revenues from low margin amr module shipments to customers in france in compared with corporate the business units outlined above utilize standard costs  which include materials  direct labor and an overhead allocation  to record product cost of sales 
variances from standard costs are reported within corporate cost of sales and are not allocated to the business units 
corporate costs of sales were comparable as a percentage of revenue in and the decrease in costs in compared with was primarily due to the combination of efficiencies gained through the consolidation of manufacturing facilities  higher than planned production volumes in and lower market prices on electronic components 
operating expenses the following table details our total operating expenses in dollars and as a percent of revenues 
note that certain amounts in and have been reclassified to conform to the presentation 
year ended december  of revenue of revenue of revenue in millions operating expenses sales and marketing product development general and administrative amortization of intangibles restructurings litigation accrual in process research and development total operating expenses sales and marketing expenses increased million in compared with  but decreased slightly as a percentage of revenue 
the increase was a result of additional product marketing  product management  and sales staffing primarily related to the companies acquired in the increase in compared to was primarily due to investments in marketing programs and systems  strategy and business development activities  and increased commissions due to higher sales 
product development expenses increased million in compared with  however decreased slightly as a percentage of revenue 
the increase was due to increased development spending related to acquisitions and increased staff levels 
the increase of million in compared with was driven by increased spending on next generation product development 
general and administrative expenses increased million in compared with  and as a percent of revenue  due to increased information technology investments  legal fees  compensation  and staffing resources 
in addition  million of the increase resulted from the entities acquired in the decrease in over was primarily due to favorable negotiation of a new communications contract and reduced legal fees for patent and fcc matters 
amortization of intangibles increased  in compared with amortization increased as a result of the addition of million in amortizable intangible assets from acquisitions completed in this was offset by the discontinuance of goodwill amortization in due to the implementation of sfas no 
as of january  goodwill amortization was  in the company completed its initial impairment test of goodwill in the second quarter of  and its annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of  and concluded in both cases that goodwill was not impaired 
we expect amortization expense to increase in as a result of a full year of amortization expense related to the acquisitions 
restructuring expenses were million in compared with a recovery of million in in  we expensed million for planned costs related to the restructuring of our european operations 
the restructuring plan will result in the closure of the vienne  france office  a reduction in workforce  the consolidation of product development efforts into existing company locations and the outsourcing of select production efforts in order to improve the overall profitability of our international operations 
restructuring activities are anticipated to be complete by mid in january  we announced plans to restructure our eis product group in raleigh  north carolina 
the restructure plan will result in an estimated charge of to million in related to workforce reductions 
restructuring expenses in reflect a net credit as a result of reversals of charges in previous periods primarily due to sublease of office space under more favorable terms than originally anticipated 
total operating expenses in increased million compared with the expenses include three unusual expenses totaling million a european restructure charge of million  a write off of in process research and development ipr d related to the acquisition of linesoft of million  and a litigation accrual related to the benghiat patent suit of million 
excluding these unusual items  operating expenses totaled million  an increase of million from however  the expenses as a percentage of revenue remained fairly consistent year to year 
approximately one third of the million increase came from our acquisitions 
in process research and development ipr d during  we recorded million in charges for ipr d related to the acquisition of linesoft as follows ipr d estimated cost to complete technology discount rate applied to ipr d linesoft s weighted average cost of capital in millions linesoft corporation at the time of acquisition  linesoft had five ipr d projects  each contributing from to of the total ipr d value 
these projects were new versions of existing software products currently being sold  but were not subject to capitalization because they had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
we expect to benefit from the ipr d projects as products that contain in process technology are marketed and sold to end users 
other income expense the following table shows other income expense and percent change from the prior year 
year ended december  change change in millions equity in affiliates interest income interest expense other income expense total other income expense we had income related to equity in affiliates of  in compared with a loss of  in in  we wrote off approximately  of an investment in an affiliate 
the loss from that write off was partially offset with our share of income from other affiliates 
the million of equity in affiliates in resulted from increased sales of our water products by a distributor affiliate and a  net gain on the sale of our interest in another partially owned domestic affiliate 
in  interest expense was million compared with million in the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to the conversion of convertible debt to equity and the early payoff of mortgage debt on the company s spokane facility 
included in other income expense was an  pretax gain from the sale of our raleigh  nc facility and a  pretax gain from the early payoff of the mortgage on our spokane facility 
included in other income expense was a million pretax gain on the early extinguishment of subordinated debt 
income taxes the effective income tax rate was approximately compared with in and in the increase over the prior years is primarily due to the non deductible million charge for in process research and development ipr d 
excluding the impact of non tax deductible ipr d charges in  the adjusted effective tax rate was 
our effective income tax rate can vary from period to period because of fluctuations in foreign operating results  changes in the valuation allowances for deferred tax assets  new or revised tax legislation  and changes in the level of business performed in different tax jurisdictions 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle during the fourth quarter of  we implemented sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  which outlines the staff s views on revenue recognition 
as a result  we changed our revenue recognition for certain transactions related to customer acceptance  fob destination shipments  and outsourcing contracts under which we retain title to the related equipment 
the implementation was accounted for as a cumulative change in accounting principle effective january  effective january   the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
provides that goodwill should be tested for impairment annually at the reporting unit level rather than being amortized over a useful life 
the company completed its initial impairment test of goodwill in the second quarter of  and its annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of  and concluded in both cases that goodwill was not impaired 
financial condition year ended december  in millions cash flow information operating activities investing activities financing activities net increase decrease in cash operating activities we generated million of cash from operations in compared with million in and million in net income  adjusted for the change in noncash charges and credits  contributed million to the million increase in cash flow from operations from to although net income declined million compared with  noncash charges to income increased million 
the primary reason for the increase in noncash charges was a million charge for acquired in process research and development associated with the linesoft acquisition 
in addition  changes in operating assets and liabilities  net of effects of acquisitions  contributed million to the to increase in operating cash flow 
this was driven primarily by a million litigation accrual recorded in the fourth quarter  and a million restructuring liability related to our international business unit 
the costs associated with the restructuring accrual are expected to be substantially disbursed by mid the amount and timing of the payment  if any  in connection with the litigation accrual is unknown at this time

financing activities used million in cash in mostly due to million used to pay down short term bank borrowings and million for the repurchase of subordinated debt in the first quarter of we have no off balance sheet financing agreements 
investments in  we invested just under million in an early stage start up firm that is developing internet based energy monitoring and management software and services 
the firm  lanthorn technologies  has not yet produced any significant revenue 
the form of the investment is a secured convertible note with a term of five years 
we may convert the note at any time into the common stock of the firm 
if we had converted our note into equity at december   it would have been converted into of the firm s common stock assuming that all granted stock options and other convertible debt of the firm were exercised or converted 
we have also entered into a distribution and licensing agreement with the firm  which gives us non exclusive distribution and licensing rights 
during  we invested  in the common stock of an early stage metering services company

during and  there was little partnership activity 
during  we made a  common stock investment in a startup company involved in developing gateway and other metering related products  for which we received a equity interest 
the company has not yet established a history of consistent revenue  has not yet reached breakeven cash flow and is currently looking for additional funding 
during the year ended december   we loaned million  in the form of a convertible note receivable  to emobile which was developing a web based wireless workforce management tool 
the note remains as an intercompany note and is eliminated during the company s normal accounting consolidation of subsidiary operations 
liquidity  sources and uses of capital at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
during  we utilized million to complete the three acquisitions and million to repurchase company stock 
we have historically funded our operations and growth with cash flow from operations  borrowings and sales of our stock 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates on cash equivalents and short term investments  which are rated a or better by standard poor s or moody s and which have market interest rates 
as of december   availability under our million revolving line of credit was reduced by outstanding letters of credit of million 
we believe existing cash resources and available borrowings are adequate to meet our cash needs through see discussion in subsequent event section regarding changes to our credit facility in connection with the acquisition of silicon energy 
during the second quarter of  we redeemed all of our subordinated convertible debt totaling million through the issuance of approximately million shares of our common stock 
there was a minimal cash impact as a result of this conversion 
we maintain performance and bid bonds for certain customers 
the performance bonds usually cover the installation phase of a contract and may on occasion cover the operations and maintenance phase of outsourcing contracts 
bonds in force were million and million at december  and  respectively  some of which are guaranteed by standby letters of credit 
the outstanding amounts of standby letters of credit were and million at december  and  respectively 
in addition  we guarantee lease payments for certain equipment leased by an affiliated company 
in the event that the affiliate is unable to pay a monthly lease obligation  itron would be required to make the payment 
if itron does not make the payment  the equipment would be returned to the lessor 
the maximum future lease obligation of the guarantee at december  was  in the event that the equipment is not in working condition  itron would be obligated to pay for the equipment to be returned to working condition 
the lease and our guarantee terminate in working capital as of december  was million compared with million at december  the decrease in working capital is primarily due to an increase in current liabilities of million related to the litigation accrual  a million accrual related to restructuring activity  and the liquidation of previously held short term investments to support acquisition activity 
the number of days outstanding for billed and unbilled accounts receivable was and days as of december  and  respectively 
historically  the number of days outstanding ratio for the company has been driven more by specific contract billing terms as compared to collection issues

the purchase price consisted of million in cash and the issuance of  shares of itron common stock 
in addition  we are required to pay additional amounts to certain linesoft shareholders of up to million in the event that certain defined revenue targets in  and or are exceeded

our primary exposure has related to non dollar denominated sales  cost of sales and operating expenses in our subsidiary operations in france  the united kingdom  and australia 
this means we have been subject to changes in the consolidated results of operations expressed in us dollars 
other international business  consisting primarily of shipments from the us to international distributors and customers in the pacific rim and latin america  is predominantly denominated in us dollars  which reduces our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
in some cases where sales from the us are not denominated in us dollars  we have and may hedge our foreign exchange risk by selling the expected foreign currency receipts forward 
there have been and there may continue to be large period to period fluctuations in the relative portions of international revenue that are denominated in foreign currencies 
risk sensitive financial instruments in the form of inter company trade receivables are mostly denominated in us dollars  while inter company notes are denominated in local foreign currencies 
as foreign currency exchange rates change  inter company trade receivables impact current earnings  while inter company notes are re valued and result in translation gains or losses that are reported in other comprehensive income 
because our earnings are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies  we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical increase in the value of the dollar relative to the currencies in which our transactions are denominated 
as of december   the analysis indicated that such market movements would not have had a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or on the fair value of any risk sensitive financial instruments 
the model assumes foreign currency exchange rates will shift in the same direction and relative amount 
however  exchange rates rarely move in the same direction 
this assumption may result in the overstatement or understatement of the impact of changing exchange rates on assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency 
consequently  the actual effects on operations in the future may differ materially from results of the analysis for we may  in the future  experience greater fluctuations in us dollar earnings from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we will continue to monitor and assess the impact of currency fluctuations and may institute more hedging alternatives
