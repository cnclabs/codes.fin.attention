item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods

as the number of variables and assumptions affecting the probable future resolution of the uncertainties increase  these judgments become even more subjective and complex

management estimates accruals for the self insured portion of pending accident liability  workers compensation  physical damage and cargo damage claims 
the company s self insured limit is  per claim 
these accruals are recorded at the estimated maximum exposure and are based upon individual case estimates  including negative development  and estimates of incurred but not reported losses based upon past experience 
management periodically re evaluates these estimates as events and circumstances change 
these factors may significantly impact the company s results of operations from period to period

inflation most of the company s operating expenses are inflation sensitive  with inflation generally producing increased costs of operations

forward looking statements and risk factors statements in this report that are not reported financial results or other historical information are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such statements are based on present information the company has related to its existing business circumstances and involve a number of business risks and uncertainties  any of which could cause actual results to differ materially from such forward looking statements 
further  investors are cautioned that the company does not assume any obligation to update forward looking statements based on unanticipated events or changed expectations 
in addition to specific factors that may be described in connection with any particular forward looking statement  the following factors could cause actual results to differ materially 
growth with existing customers and the ability to solicit new business is dependent upon the company s ability to provide on time service and certain economic factors 
weakness in the economy including decreased consumer demand could adversely affect the demand for the company s transportation services and future growth 
the ability to negotiate increased freight rates to offset effects of inflation and cost increases is also dependent upon the state of the economy to a certain extent 
the company may also be affected by the financial failure of existing customers resulting in fewer shipments or potential bad debt write offs 
an extended period of economic downturn could also enhance revenue growth because of industry consolidation 
the truckload industry is highly competitive with an abundance of trucking companies  both profitable and marginal 
the business failures of the marginal competition may result in increased opportunities for the financially strong 
shortages of fuel and the resulting increase in the price of diesel can have an adverse impact on operations and profitability 
instability in the middle east and south america caused dramatic increases in the price of fuel in the second half of and into the first quarter of the company s operating results are negatively impacted to the extent that high fuel costs cannot be recovered through customer fuel surcharge agreements 
the company is subject to regulation by the dot  epa  and various other federal and state authorities 
new or more comprehensive regulations pertaining to fuel emissions  driver hours of service  or other mandated regulation could result in the increased cost of operations 
in addition  increased taxes and operating fees mandated by federal and state taxing authorities can have an adverse effect on profitability 
effective october  all newly manufactured engines must comply with emission standards mandated by the epa 
truck engines manufactured prior to october  are not subject to the new emission standards 
the company does not intend to purchase any tractors with epa compliant engines until adequate testing by the manufacturers has been completed 
the pricing  engine life  maintenance cost  and fuel efficiency of the new engine could have an impact on the company s operating expenses 
the company s operation is highly dependent on the hiring and retention of experienced drivers with safe driving records 
there has been a shortage of qualified drivers and independent contractors over the past several years 
the availability of company employed drivers improved in primarily due to industry consolidation caused by the business failures of marginal competitors 
however  the availability of independent contractors has declined due to high fuel prices and the decreased availability of tractor financing 
the company expects that the hiring of qualified drivers will remain competitive 
a shortage of qualified drivers and independent contractors for an extended period of time could effect the growth and operating results of the company 
the company is involved in routine litigation incidental to its business  primarily involving claims for personal injury  property damage  and workers compensation incurred in the transportation of freight 
the company has assumed the liability for claims up to  plus administrative expenses  for each occurrence 
claims in excess of  are covered by premium based policies to levels that management considers adequate 
in recent years the cost of insurance in the industry has increased dramatically due to increased claims and economic conditions 
the company s current insurance policies expire in increases in premiums and self retention levels could impact the results of operations

the price and availability of diesel fuel are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the level of global oil production  seasonality  weather  and other market factors
