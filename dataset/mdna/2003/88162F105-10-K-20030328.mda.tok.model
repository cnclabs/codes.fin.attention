item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
results of operations the following table presents  for the periods indicated  the percentage relationship which certain items in the company s statement of operations bear to revenues  and the percentage increase or decrease in the dollar amount of such items 
the following data should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the associated notes contained elsewhere in this document 
percentage of revenues year ended december  period to period change vs vs revenues cost of revenues gross profit general and administrative expenses operating income interest expense interest income other income expense  net income before income taxes and discontinued operations net income before discontinued operations discontinued operations  net of tax net income ebitda business environment demand for the company s products and services depends primarily on activity in the oil and gas exploration and production industry in the gulf of mexico  texas  louisiana and in selected international markets 
this activity can be significantly affected by the level of industry capital expenditures for the exploration and production of oil and gas reserves  and the plugging and decommissioning of abandoned oil and gas properties 
these expenditures are influenced strongly by oil and gas prices and by oil company expectations about the supply and demand for crude oil and natural gas 
influenced by the recent global economic slowdown and political instability in opec countries such as iraq and venezuela  oil and gas companies were reluctant to increase spending on exploration and development activities during the dramatic slowdown in drilling activity that began in the middle of continued through the end of the drop was particularly sharp in us gas drilling activity  with a reduction from the prior year in average gas rigs 
the company anticipates oil and gas drilling activity in the us will remain relatively flat into the second quarter of due to the slow global economy and the uncertainty surrounding energy markets 
the company then expects activity to begin recovering in the second quarter and continuing to recover modestly in the second half of the year 
over the longer term  the company believes that there will continue to be growth opportunities for the company s products and services in both the us and international markets with the current trends of deeper gas drilling with more complex completions in the us  faster reservoir depletion in the us  more rigorous enforcement of environmental and abandonment regulations  advancing age of offshore platforms in the us  increasing development of oil and gas reserves abroad  and increasing future demand for natural gas and oil in the us and abroad 
the gulf of mexico and international oil and gas rig counts are leading indicators for the fluids business 
natural gas prices and gas drilling in north and south america are key indicators for the production testing business 
began with rigs running in the gulf of mexico  increased to a high of in february  and closed the year at the international rig count started the year at rigs  dropped to a low of rigs at mid year and then finished the year at rigs 
for those international regions in which the company has significant operations latin america  europe and africa  the average rig count dropped from the prior year average 
us gas drilling decreased during this period  as the average gas price dropped approximately from the average price 
natural gas prices remained fairly flat during most of  averaging approximately mmbtu and then increasing in the last few weeks of the year to close at mmbtu 
the gas rig count began the year at  dropped to in april and then recovered to by the end of the year 
the fluids division manufactures and distributes completion fluids and provides filtration and associated products and engineering services to exploration and production companies worldwide 
the division s products and services are utilized in the completion of a successful well or the workover of a currently producing well and can also be used under certain drilling conditions 
the company is vertically integrated into the production of calcium chloride and brominated completion fluids  making it a relatively low cost supplier of a number of these products 
the division s major markets include inland water and offshore gulf of mexico  the north sea  mexico  south america and offshore west africa 
the year began with moderate drilling activity  declined in the second quarter and then leveled off for the rest of the year 
the division s international areas experienced a market slowdown as well  with certain major customers discontinuing large projects 
pricing improvements for some of the division s products over the prior year helped to offset the decline in volumes sold and equipment utilization rates 
the company s management anticipates that worldwide spending on exploration and production activities will increase moderately in over the prior year  beginning in the second quarter 
higher rig counts are anticipated in the second quarter with further improvement as the year progresses 
management believes that this increase in activity  combined with the company s current market position as a major supplier of fluids  should provide increased revenues and operating profits for this division in the well abandonment decommissioning division is in the business of well plug and abandonment  platform decommissioning and removal  pipeline abandonment and site clearance for oil and gas companies 
in addition  the division provides electric wireline and drilling services and is a producer of oil and gas 
its services are marketed primarily in the gulf coast region of the us including onshore  in the inland waters and offshore 
platform decommissioning and well abandonment operations are driven by regulations  which offers a partial hedge against fluctuations in the commodity price of natural gas 
in particular  mms regulations require removal of platforms and remediation of the seabed at the well site to its original state within twelve months after lease expiration 
other factors influencing this business include seasonal weather patterns  which typically result in weaker first quarter operations  tighter environmental statutes and stricter enforcement of abandonment regulations by regulatory agencies 
the company can contract and manage  on a day rate or turnkey basis  all aspects of the decommissioning and abandonment of fields of all sizes 
the division includes maritech resources  inc maritech  a wholly owned subsidiary formed in to own  manage and exploit the producing oil and gas properties acquired in conjunction with its well abandonment business 
the division provides the oil and gas companies with alternative ways of managing their well abandonment obligations  while effectively base loading well abandonment and decommissioning work for the division 
this may include purchasing an ownership interest in the properties and operating them in exchange for assuming the proportionate share of the well abandonment obligations associated with such properties 
in some transactions  cash may be received or paid by the company to balance the economics 
maritech typically purchases natural gas and oil properties that are generally in the later stages of their productive life 
although higher natural gas prices tend to reduce the number of mature properties available for acquisition by maritech  these higher prices typically contribute to higher production revenues for maritech 
in contrast  lower natural gas prices typically contribute to lower production revenues for maritech and a general increase in the number of mature properties available for abandonment 
the company estimates the third party fair market value including an estimated profit to plug and abandon the wells  decommission and remove the platforms  abandon the pipelines and clear the sites and uses that estimate to record its proportionate share of the decommissioning liability 
many of the transactions have been structured so that the estimated fair market value of the natural gas and oil reserves received and recorded equals the fair value of its working interest ownership of the well abandonment and decommissioning liabilities recorded  net of any cash received or paid 
these reserve costs are accounted for using the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities  and are grouped by individual field or lease and depleted on a unit of production basis upon the depletion of each individual oil and gas producing property 
during the fourth quarter of  the company purchased oil and gas properties from newfield exploration in exchange for the assumption of approximately million in decommissioning liability 
oil and gas producing assets were recorded at their estimated fair market value  approximating the value of the decommissioning liabilities assumed  less cash received by the company of million 
other smaller acquisitions were completed in may in january  maritech purchased oil and gas assets in offshore gulf of mexico and onshore louisiana locations from dominion exploration and production  inc in exchange for the assumption of approximately million in decommissioning liabilities 
oil and gas producing assets were recorded at their estimated fair market value  approximating the value of the decommissioning liabilities assumed  less cash received of million 
the testing services division s principal operations include flow back pressure and volume testing and separation of impurities in gas wells 
the primary markets served are texas  louisiana  mississippi  alabama  offshore gulf of mexico  mexico and venezuela 
while testing is performed periodically during a well s life  the most extensive use of the company s equipment and services is immediately following completion of a well 
the company continued its expansion of the production testing product line with the acquisition of precision well testing company in july  this acquisition strengthens the division s presence in the offshore gulf of mexico and onshore areas 
due to the significant decline in us gas drilling activity during  the division experienced a drop in revenues and operating profits 
natural gas prices were approximately per mmbtu in late march   after having peaked at over per mmbtu in late february 
the company expects that the current increase in gas prices and other improving market conditions should result in increased demand for its products and services 
the company should also benefit from the recent expansion of its business through broadened market coverage in the offshore gulf of mexico and international areas 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing the financial statements  the company makes assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported 
the company periodically evaluates its estimates and judgments related to bad debts and impairments of long lived assets  including goodwill and decommissioning liability 
note b to the consolidated financial statements contains the accounting policies governing each of these matters 
the company s estimates are based on historical experience and on future expectations that are believed to be reasonable 
the combination of these factors forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results are likely to differ from the company s current estimates  and those differences may be material 
reserves for bad debts are determined on a specific identification basis when the company believes that the required payment of specific amounts owed to it is not probable 
a significant portion of the company s revenues come from oil and gas exploration and production companies 
this activity can be significantly affected by the level of industry capital expenditures for the exploration and production of oil and gas reserves and the plugging and decommissioning of abandoned oil and gas properties 
these expenditures are influenced strongly by oil company expectations about the supply and demand for crude oil and natural gas products and by the energy price environment that results from supply and demand imbalances 
if  due to these circumstances  certain customers are unable to repay some or all of the amounts owed the company  additional allowance may be required 
the determination of impairment on long lived assets  including goodwill  is conducted periodically when indicators of impairment are present 
if such indicators are present  the determination of the amount of impairment is based on the company s judgments as to the future operating cash flows to be generated from these assets throughout their estimated useful lives 
the oil and gas industry is cyclical and the company s estimates of the period over which future cash flows will be generated  as well as the predictability of these cash flows  can have significant impact on the carrying value of these assets and  in periods of prolonged down cycles  may result in impairment charges 
the company s maritech resources  inc subsidiary purchases natural gas and oil properties and assumes the related well abandonment and decommissioning liabilities 
many of the transactions have been structured so that the estimated fair market value of the natural gas and oil reserves received and recorded equals the amount of its working interest ownership of the well abandonment and decommissioning liabilities recorded  net of any cash received or paid 
the process of estimating oil and gas reserves is complex  requiring significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
as a result  these estimates are inherently imprecise 
actual future production  cash flows  development expenditures  operating and abandonment expenses and quantities of recoverable natural gas and oil reserves may vary substantially from those initially estimated by the company 
any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of proved reserves 
these reserve costs are accounted for using the successful efforts method and are grouped by individual field or lease and depleted on a unit of production basis upon the depletion of each individual oil and gas producing property 
the company performs impairment tests on these assets when indicators of impairment are present 
the company estimates the third party market value including an estimated profit to plug and abandon wells  abandon the pipelines  decommission and remove the platforms and clear the sites  and uses that estimate to record its proportionate share of the decommissioning liability 
in estimating the decommissioning liabilities  the company performs detailed estimating procedures  analysis and engineering studies 
whenever practical  maritech will utilize the services of its affiliated companies to perform well abandonment and decommissioning work 
when these services are performed by an affiliated company  all recorded intercompany revenues are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 
the recorded decommissioning liability associated with a specific property is fully extinguished when the property is completely abandoned 
the liability is first reduced by all cash expenses incurred to abandon and decommission the property 
if the liability exceeds or is less than tetra s out of pocket costs then the difference is reported as income or loss in the period in which the work is performed 
the company reviews the adequacy of its decommissioning liability whenever indicators suggest that the estimated cash flows underlying the liability have changed materially 
the timing and amounts of these cash flows are subject to changes in the energy industry environment and may result in additional liabilities recorded  which in turn would increase the carrying values of the related properties 
the company recognizes revenue on certain well abandonment and decommissioning projects as it is earned at estimated collectible amounts 
revenue on significant turnkey contracts is recognized on the percentage of completion method based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs at completion 
contract price and cost estimates are reviewed periodically as work progresses and adjustments are reflected in the period in which such estimates are reviewed 
provisions for estimated losses on such contracts are made in the period such losses are determined 
income taxes the company provides for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this standard takes into account the differences between financial statement treatment and tax treatment of certain transactions 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
this calculation requires the company to make certain estimates about its future operations 
changes in state  federal and foreign tax laws as well as changes in the company s financial condition could affect these estimates 
compared to revenues revenues for the year ended december were million  down million or from the prior year total of million 
all operating divisions of the company experienced a drop in their revenues 
the fluids division reported revenues of million  a decrease of million or from the prior year 
the division s revenues reflected the drop of in the average offshore gulf of mexico rig count from  and the drop of in the average rig count activity for certain international regions in which the division operates 
weather conditions in the gulf of mexico in the fourth quarter contributed to the drop in activity as did political events in venezuela 
the well abandonment decommissioning division reported revenues of million  a decrease of million or from the prior year 
the division s heavy lift barge  the southern hercules  was out of service for approximately ten months of the year for renovation and repair 
the september and october gulf of mexico hurricanes and earlier tropical storms contributed to lower utilization of the inland water and offshore well abandonment rigs for much of the second half of the year 
in addition  revenues for the division s exploitation and production company  maritech resources  inc  were lower than last year due to shut in production resulting from hurricane damage as well as lower commodity prices received during the year 
the division s electric wireline business saw its equipment utilization drop significantly from the prior year as the lower rig count activity contributed to fewer projects in addition to putting downward pressure on pricing for services 
revenues for the testing services division were million  a decrease of million or from the prior year 
revenues for the domestic production testing group were down from the prior year reflecting the drop in the us average gas rig count of 
the division acquired the assets of precision well testing company in july   bolstering the offshore gulf of mexico equipment fleet 
gross profit gross profit for the year was million compared to million in the prior year  a decrease of million or 
the decrease is a result of the drop in revenues of million combined with a percentage point decline in margin percentage to 
the fluids division s gross profit decreased in gross profit dollars as a result of the lower revenues 
helping to offset this decline was a percentage point improvement in this division s gross profit percentage to as a result of improved pricing in select areas and a favorable mix of product and service revenues 
the well abandonment decommissioning division gross profit declined from the prior year in gross dollars  and dropped  percentage points in gross profit percentage to 
lower utilization of the division s rig fleet  heavy lift barge and other equipment contributed to the decline  in addition to the costs and downtime related to the gulf of mexico storms in the second half of the year 
the division also increased its infrastructure in the decommissioning and well abandonment businesses to accommodate the higher activity associated with the acquisition opportunities and the management of maritech oil and gas properties 
in the first quarter  the division s heavy lift barge the southern hercules was involved in a storm related accident that resulted in significant downtime and repair expense  contributing to the decline in gross profit 
during this downtime period  the company elected to perform substantial upgrades and capital improvements to the southern hercules before returning it to service  which is anticipated in the second quarter of the company is currently in negotiations with its insurance company regarding coverage for the accident and expects to receive a significant portion of its repair costs  the repair costs related to the southern hercules have been expensed as incurred 
maritech s gross profit was lower than the previous year due to lower average realized commodity prices in  higher downtime  and repair expense and logistics costs related to the gulf of mexico storms 
the testing services division s gross profit decreased in gross dollars from the prior year  representing a  percentage point drop in its gross profit percentage to 
lower gas drilling activity contributed to much of the decline in the production testing business where underutilized equipment and personnel kept margins down 
due to throughput inefficiencies during the year  the norway process services plant experienced higher labor and storage costs as well as reduced revenues related to unprocessed materials 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative g a expenses were million in compared to million in the prior year  a decrease of million or 
g a expenses as a percent of revenue increased to in from in the prior year 
reductions in incentive compensation  lower legal expenses as a result of recovery of legal costs of million associated with a long standing suit settled in  and reduced sales and marketing expenses accounted for most of the dollar decrease 
these reductions were offset by additional infrastructure in information technology and other corporate departments necessary to support the future growth of the company 
other income expenses other income and expense was million of income for the year compared to million of expense in the prior year 
this change is a result of state tax refunds offset by losses on the disposal of fixed assets  loan fees and various foreign non income taxes in excess of prior year amounts 
interest expense and income taxes net interest expense for the year was million compared to million in the prior year 
the increase is a result of the interest expense allocation to discontinued operations in the first three quarters of actual interest paid decreased million from the prior year due to a significant reduction in average long term debt 
the provision for income taxes was million in  a decrease of million as a result of reduced earnings from the prior year 
the effective tax rate for the year was versus in due primarily to a reduction in state income tax expense and the utilization of general business credits 
net income net income for the year was million compared to million in the prior year 
net income per diluted share was on  average diluted shares outstanding compared to per diluted share on  average diluted shares outstanding in  or excluding goodwill amortization 
compared to revenues revenues for the year ended december  were million  up million or from the prior year of million 
all divisions of the company experienced significant growth during the year 
the fluids division reported revenues of million  an increase of million or over the prior year 
this division benefited from improved overall year to year oil and gas completion and workover activity in the gulf of mexico  improved pricing  and a tightening fluids supply market 
in addition  the international fluids business increased by with improved activity coming from the uk markets 
the well abandonment decommissioning division experienced significant growth in with reported revenues of million  up million or 
with the addition of significant amounts of capital equipment in and  combined with significant improvements in equipment utilization  the division reported record revenues in inland water and offshore activity increased with improved utilization and rates 
revenues from the decommissioning business increased substantially with the addition of heavy lift equipment to the division s product offerings 
the onshore plug and abandonment and wireline businesses also realized significant year over year growth through improved utilization and rates 
in addition  revenues of the division s exploitation company  maritech resources  inc  grew as a result of oil and gas production purchased or developed in conjunction with our expanding well abandonment and decommissioning business and higher natural gas prices in the first half of the year 
revenues for the testing services division were million  an increase of million or 
revenue increases in this division were the result of improved market conditions driven by strong natural gas drilling  additional equipment employed and improved pricing 
domestic production testing revenues were up with a full year s utilization of the assets acquired in the swap with key energy and improved pricing 
in addition  international revenues  principally from mexico  also increased 
gross profit gross profit for the year was million compared to million in the prior year  an increase of million or 
the increase was due to the million increase in revenues for the year combined with a percentage point improvement in margin percentages to 
the fluids division dollar margins improved during the year  reflecting improved pricing in domestic markets 
the division s gross profit percentage increased by percentage points to 
the well abandonment decommissioning division realized a growth in dollar margins year to year while improving its gross profit percentage by percentage points to 
these gains were the result of improved equipment utilization in the onshore rigs  offshore rigless packages  wireline units and inland water rigs 
higher day rates and improved service mix to higher margin offshore work also significantly impacted margin improvements 
gross profits from the division s oil and gas exploitation company  maritech  comprised approximately of the company s total margin 
maritech s dollar margins improved while its gross profit percentage increased by  percentage points as a result of the spike in natural gas pricing during the first half of the year 
the testing services division dollar margins increased by with its margin percentage remaining approximately flat at 
improved gas drilling activity in the gulf of mexico stimulated increased utilization and improved pricing 
the division also benefited from having available for service those assets acquired in the asset swap with key energy and  to a lesser extent  the assets acquired from production well testers in september  general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million in compared to million in  an increase of million or 
g a expense as a percentage of revenues decreased from in to in expenses in the well abandonment decommissioning division increased due to the added infrastructure necessary to support the division s growth 
expenses in the domestic production testing operation also increased as a result of expansion and acquisitions 
finally  the company s record earnings performance during resulted in increased expenditures under the company s incentive compensation program 
interest expense and taxes net interest expense for was million compared to million in the prior year 
reduced long term debt balances resulted in this decrease 
the provision for income taxes was million in  an increase of million as a result of improved earnings during the year 
the effective tax rate for the year was  relatively unchanged from net income net income for the year was million compared to a net loss of million which included a million loss on the disposal of discontinued operations in the prior year 
net income per diluted share was in on  average diluted shares outstanding compared to a loss of per share on  average diluted shares outstanding in liquidity and capital resources over the past three years  the company has funded its operating activities from internally generated cash flow and to a lesser extent  from the sale of assets  even though some of this period was marked by weak industry demand 
any excess cash generated has historically been used to pay down debt or fund the company s stock repurchase program 
during the three year period ended december   the company generated approximately million of net cash flow from operating activities which it used to fund the purchase of approximately million of capital equipment and million in acquisitions 
over the same period  total outstanding debt was reduced from million at december  to million at december  this reduction of million was funded through cash generated from operations and cash generated from the restructuring of the company and disposal of non core assets 
during this period  working capital decreased from million in to million in and then increased to million in operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million 
this decrease is primarily due to the lower earnings reported in and a decrease in year end accounts payable  as well as lower accrued liabilities associated with salaries  taxes and cash payments to decommission certain platforms and structures of the company s maritech resources subsidiary 
accounts receivable decreased during the year  reflecting the reduced revenues in the fourth quarter of from the prior year quarter as well as an improved collection process 
in contrast  accounts receivable increased in over the prior year as a result of increased revenues 
inventories decreased in by approximately million  reflecting the lower activity levels in the fourth quarter of compared to the prior year s quarter primarily in the fluids business 
by comparison  inventories increased in due to weakening market conditions in the fourth quarter as inventory levels trailed the decline in activity 
investing activities cash capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million and investments in other assets were million 
approximately million was invested in the fluids division for the procurement of plant production equipment  filtration and blending equipment and a long term supply agreement for liquid calcium chloride 
this new supply agreement effectively replaces the previous liquid calcium chloride supply contract with the same supplier that was to terminate by the end of the consideration paid for the contract is being amortized over the term of the agreement 
the well abandonment decommissioning division invested approximately million during the year to expand and upgrade its fleet in support of its inland waters and offshore abandonment and decommissioning operations 
the company also invested in significant refurbishment and upgrade of its heavy lift barge  the southern hercules 
approximately million was invested in the testing services division  a significant portion of which went to replace and enhance the production testing equipment fleet 
the company also invested additional capital in its process services operations to enhance its oily residual separation business 
the remaining funds were used to support general corporate activities 
in the third quarter of  the company acquired the assets of precision well testing company precision for million in cash 
precision provides production testing services to the us gulf coast onshore and offshore gulf of mexico markets 
the business has been integrated into tetra s testing services division as part of its production testing operations  supplementing existing operations in louisiana and south texas 
in addition  in september  the company acquired the assets of a small onshore well abandonment company for million in cash 
the business provides onshore well abandonment services to the eastern texas and northern louisiana markets  and has been integrated into the well abandonment decommissioning division of tetra 
during the fourth quarter of  the company purchased oil and gas properties from newfield exploration in exchange for the assumption of approximately million in decommissioning liability 
oil and gas producing assets were recorded at their estimated fair market value  approximating the value of the decommissioning liabilities assumed  less cash received by the company of million 
during  the company disposed of certain marine vessels including a jack up rig  slickline equipment and other various equipment for proceeds of million 
during the third quarter of  the company acquired the assets of production well testers  inc pwt for approximately million in cash 
pwt provides production testing services to offshore gulf of mexico markets as well as onshore gulf coast markets 
the business was integrated into tetra s testing services division as part of its production testing operations  enhancing the division s production testing presence in louisiana and expanding operations into the mississippi  alabama and the gulf of mexico markets 
the company acquired the assets of lee chemical during the fourth quarter of for approximately million in cash 
lee is a producer and distributor of liquid calcium chloride in the us west coast markets 
also in the fourth quarter of  the company s well abandonment decommissioning division purchased oil and gas producing properties in exchange for the assumption of approximately million of decommissioning liabilities related to the properties and other considerations 
as part of that transaction  the company received approximately million of cash to satisfy other working interest owners future well abandonment obligations 
this cash is reported as restricted cash on the company s balance sheet 
the oil and gas producing assets were recorded at the future estimated costs to abandon and decommission the properties  net of cash received 
financing activities to fund its capital and working capital requirements  the company uses cash flow as well as its general purpose  secured  prime rate libor based revolving line of credit with a bank syndicate led by bank of america 
in september  the company amended its credit facility expanding its available line of credit to million 
this agreement matures in december  carries no amortization  and is secured by accounts receivable and inventories 
the agreement permits the company to execute up to million of capital leases and million of unsecured senior notes  and there are no limitations or restrictions on operating leases or unsecured non recourse financing 
tetra s credit facility is subject to common financial ratio covenants 
these include  among others  a funded debt to ebitda ratio  a fixed charge coverage ratio  a tangible net worth minimum  an asset coverage ratio  and dollar limits on the total amount of capital expenditures and acquisitions the company may undertake in any given year without receiving a waiver from the lenders 
the company pays a commitment fee on unused portions of the line and a libor based interest rate which decreases or increases as the company s funded debt to ebitda ratio as defined in the credit agreement improves or deteriorates 
the company is not required to maintain compensating balances 
the covenants also include certain restrictions on the company for the sale of assets 
as of december   the company has million in letters of credit and million in long term debt outstanding against a million line of credit  leaving a net availability of million 
the company believes this new credit facility will meet its foreseeable capital and working capital requirements through december the company s ability to access its revolving credit line is largely unaffected by fluctuations in its stock price 
however  the company must comply with certain financial ratio covenants in the credit agreement 
significant deterioration of these ratios could result in default under the credit agreement and  if not remedied  could result in termination of the agreement and acceleration of the outstanding balance under the facility 
the company s ability to comply with these financial covenants centers largely upon its ability to generate adequate ebitda see item  footnote for ebitda reconciliation and disclosure 
historically  the company s financial performance has been more than adequate to meet these covenants  and the company expects this trend to continue 
over the past three years  the company s ebitda increased from million in to million in then dropped to million in during that same period  the company s debt decreased from million to million 
in september  the company entered into two interest rate swap agreements  each with a nominal amount of million  which were effective january  and expired on january  the interest rate swap agreements provided for the company to pay interest quarterly at a fixed annual rate of approximately  beginning april  and required the issuer to pay interest to the company calculated on a floating rate based on libor 
the company may execute  if appropriate  a new interest swap agreement in to hedge its variable rate risk on a portion of its projected debt balance 
in november  the company announced that its board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to million of its common stock 
the company has repurchased its stock on occasion since that time when it felt that its stock price was undervalued in relation to its peer group  financial position and future growth prospects and  consequently  was a sound investment of its capital 
during the year the company repurchased  shares of its stock at a cost of million  and in it repurchased  shares at a cost of million 
the company also received million during from the exercising of stock options by employees 
in addition to the aforementioned revolving credit facility  the company funds its short term liquidity requirements from cash generated by operations  short term vendor financing and  to a minor extent  from leasing with institutional leasing companies 
the company believes its principal sources of liquidity  cash flow from operations  revolving credit facility and other traditional financing arrangements are adequate to meet its current and anticipated capital and operating requirements through at least december the table below recaps the company s contractual cash obligations as of december  payments due total thereafter in thousands long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases maritech decommissioning liability total contractual cash obligations decommissioning liabilities must be satisfied within twelve months after an oil and gas property s lease has expired 
lease expiration occurs six months after the last producing well on the lease ceases production 
the company has estimated the timing of these payments based upon anticipated lease expiration dates  which are subject to many changing variables that can influence the ultimate timing of these cash flows 
the amounts shown represent the estimated fair values as of december  other commercial commitments of the company as of december  include letters of credit of million  all of which will expire within one year 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to market risk exposure related to changes in interest rates on the floating rate portion of its credit facility 
these instruments carry interest at an agreed upon percentage rate spread above libor 
at december   the company had million outstanding under its credit facility  all of which was subject to an interest rate swap 
the interest rate swap agreements provided the company with a fixed interest rate which mitigated a portion of the company s risk against increases in interest rates 
these agreements expired on january  the company has no financial instruments subject to foreign currency fluctuation at december  the company has market risk exposure in the pricing applicable to its oil and gas production 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot prices in the us natural gas market 
historically  prices received for oil and gas production have been volatile and unpredictable  and price volatility is expected to continue 
the company s risk management activities involve the use of derivative financial instruments  such as swap agreements  to hedge the impact of market price risk exposures for a portion of its oil and gas production 
the company is exposed to the volatility of oil and gas prices for the portion of its oil and gas production that is not hedged 
fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  requires companies to record derivatives on the balance sheet as assets and liabilities  measured at fair value 
gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives are accounted for depending on the use of the derivative and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting 
the company adopted this accounting standard  as required  on january
