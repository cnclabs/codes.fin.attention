item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report and audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in our annual report on this form k 
description of the company indevus is a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the development and commercialization of a diversified portfolio of product candidates  including multiple compounds in late stage clinical development 
we currently have six compounds in development trospium for overactive bladder  pagoclone for panic and generalized anxiety disorders  citicoline for ischemic stroke  ip for pain and inflammatory disorders  pro for the prevention of infection by hiv and other sexually transmitted pathogens  and aminocandin for treatment of systemic fungal infections 
significant product developments in fiscal in december  we announced the results of a phase ii clinical trial in germany  subsequently published in the journal of the american medical association in september  showing that treatment with ip significantly reduced neuropathic pain  with no evidence of significant adverse events or psychoactive properties 
we plan to initiate additional clinical trials with ip in in august  we restructured our licensing agreement arrangement for ip by renegotiating our licensing agreement with manhattan whereby all remaining rights to ip owned by manhattan were assigned to us and whereby our financial obligations to manhattan related to the future development of ip were terminated  in exchange for a combination of cash and equity payments from us to manhattan 
at that time  we also entered into an agreement with sumner burstein  phd  the individual owner of certain intellectual property rights related to ip  under which this individual granted to us an exclusive worldwide license to these rights in exchange for up front  milestone and royalty payments 
we took a charge to operations of approximately  for these transactions 
in december  we entered into an amended licensing agreement with lilly related to sarafem  a currently marketed treatment for premenstrual dysphoric disorder  providing for a  initial payment to us upon the signing of the agreement and royalty payments from lilly to us based on net sales of sarafem in the us from october  until the expiration of our patent on sarafem 
in january  galen holdings plc announced the completion of its acquisition of the us sales and marketing rights to sarafem from lilly 
pursuant to our agreement with lilly  the remaining milestone payments of  were accelerated and received by us from lilly in february and reflected as royalty revenue 
mit  our licensor of patent rights to sarafem  is entitled to a portion of payments made to us by lilly 
we initially licensed to lilly exclusive  worldwide rights to a patent covering the use of fluoxetine to treat conditions and symptoms associated with premenstrual syndrome in june in april  we submitted an nda to the fda for trospium 
during fiscal  we initiated a broad range of pre commercialization activities for trospium 
we are conducting additional clinical studies with trospium  and we signed an exclusive agreement with shire laboratories  inc in march to develop extended release formulations of trospium 
we have begun pharmacokinetic and safety studies with several once a day formulations  and we expect to begin advanced clinical trials with one of these formulations in in april  we licensed exclusive  worldwide rights from aventis to aminocandin  a member of a new class of drugs known as echinocandins for the treatment of systemic fungal infections 
in exchange for these rights and for aventis inventory of aminocandin  we made an up front  licensing payment to aventis of  and are responsible for milestone payments and royalties on future sales to aventis 
we are also responsible for all development and commercialization activities for aminocandin  and we plan to initiate clinical testing with the current intravenous formulation of aminocandin in in addition  we plan to pursue the development of an oral formulation of this drug 

table of contents critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reported periods 
these items are constantly monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances  and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future 
changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate 
critical accounting policies we believe a critical accounting policy is a policy that is both important to the portrayal of our financial conditions and results  and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments and estimates 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this form k for the fiscal year ended september   we consider our revenue recognition policy critical and therefore we state it below 
revenue recognition royalty revenue consists of payments received from licensees for a portion of sales proceeds from products that utilize our licensed technologies and is recognized when the amount of and basis for such royalty payments are reported to us in accurate and appropriate form and in accordance with the related license agreement 
contract and license fee revenue is primarily generated through collaborative license and development agreements with strategic partners for the development and commercialization of our product candidates 
the terms of the agreements typically include non refundable license fees  funding of research and development  payments based upon achievement of certain milestones and royalties on net product sales 
non refundable license fees are recognized as contract and license fee revenue when we have a contractual right to receive such payment provided a contractual arrangement exists  the contract price is fixed or determinable  the collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and we have no further performance obligations under the license agreement 
revenues from milestone payments related to arrangements under which we have no continuing performance obligations are recognized upon achievement of the related milestone 
revenues from milestone payments related to arrangements under which we have continuing performance obligations are recognized as revenue upon achievement of the milestone only if all of the following conditions are met the milestone payments are non refundable  achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  substantive effort is involved in achieving the milestone  and the amount of the milestone is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with achievement of the milestone 
determination as to whether a milestone meets the aforementioned conditions involves management s judgment 
if any of these conditions are not met  the milestone payments are deferred and recognized as revenue over the term of the arrangement as we complete our performance obligations 
cash received in advance of revenue recognition is recorded as deferred revenue 
significant judgments and estimates insurance claim receivable as of september   we had an outstanding insurance claim of approximately  for services rendered through may  by the group of law firms defending us in the redux related product liability 
table of contents litigation 
the full amount of our current outstanding insurance claim is made pursuant to our product liability policy issued to us by reliance insurance company reliance  which is in liquidation proceedings 
based upon discussions with our attorneys and other consultants regarding the amount and timing of potential collection of our claim on reliance  we have recorded a reserve against our outstanding and estimated claim receivable from reliance to reduce the balance to the estimated net realizable value of  reflecting our best estimate given the available facts and circumstances 
we believe our reserve of approximately  against the insurance claim on reliance as of september  is a significant estimate reflecting management s judgment 
to the extent we do not collect the insurance claim receivable of  we would be required to record additional charges 
alternatively  if we collect amounts in excess of the current receivable balance  we would record a credit for the additional funds received in the statement of operations 
redux related liabilities in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reduced our estimate of the amount of redux related expenses  including legal expenses  remaining due  in part  to a decline in the amount of actual payments during as a result  we reduced our accrued liability for redux related expenses by approximately  and reflected this reduction as a credit in marketing  general and administrative expense 
at september   we have an accrued liability of approximately  for such redux related expenses  including legal expenses 
the amounts we ultimately pay could differ significantly from the amount currently accrued at september  to the extent the amounts paid differ from the amounts accrued  we will record a charge or credit to the statement of operations 
results of operations fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september our net loss increased  to  or per share  basic  in fiscal from  or per share  basic  in fiscal this increased net loss is primarily the result of our continued efforts to develop trospium  including clinical trials  filing of an nda  and development of a once a day formulation  and premarketing activities related to trospium 
total revenues increased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal royalty revenue  which comprises of total revenue  relates to royalties received from lilly for sales of sarafem and increased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal royalty revenue in fiscal was recognized pursuant to our renegotiated agreement with lilly see note n of notes to consolidated financial statements and includes  of accelerated milestone payments received from lilly 
royalty revenue in fiscal was recognized pursuant to our original agreement with lilly and included approximately  of royalty revenue in the three month period ended december  which resulted from sales of sarafem in a higher royalty payment bracket 
contract and license fee revenue of  in fiscal consisted primarily of  from an initial payment received from lilly related to the renegotiated agreement for sarafem 
the balance of contract and license fee revenue relates to a research grant related to funding of certain pro development 
contract and license fee revenue of  in fiscal consisted of a  milestone payment from amgen inc amgen related to continuation of development of leptin receptor technology which we licensed to amgen  funding of certain pro development from conrad and other revenue 
cost of revenues of  and  in fiscal and  respectively  consisted primarily of amounts due or paid to mit for their portion of the contractual payments and royalties received from lilly 
additionally  cost of revenues includes the development costs related to the pro development agreements 
research and development expenses increased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this increase is primarily related to trospium and includes increased clinical costs  including costs for the ongoing clinical trial  continuing development of extended release formulations of 
table of contents trospium  and costs related to the preparation of the nda 
fiscal research and development expenses also include license and contractual payments aggregating  related to aminocandin and pro and increased costs related to the development of pagoclone and ip partially offsetting these increased costs is a decrease in noncash expense related to a stock option grant and modifications of stock option grants to an executive officer of the company in fiscal  a decrease in development expense related to dersalazine due our cessation of development of the compound  and a license fee of  related to ip in fiscal total research and development expenses for fiscal substantially relate to our major compounds being developed as follows trospium  pagoclone  citicoline  ip  aminocandin  and pro  we also incurred research and development expenses for fiscal of  related to other compounds and initiatives 
marketing  general and administrative expense increased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal these increases are primarily due to continuing pre marketing activities for trospium  and also include costs related to our attendance at the american urological association convention in april in connection with the filing and fda acceptance of the nda for trospium  we have increased our rate of expenditure for trospium pre marketing activities 
also contributing to increased marketing  general and administrative expense is higher legal  insurance and other administrative expenses 
partially offsetting these increases is a decrease in noncash expense related to modifications of stock option grants to directors and executive officers of the company in fiscal and other stock option grants to consultants and a reduction of approximately  of our accrued liability for redux related expenses 
investment income decreased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal these decreases resulted primarily from reduced market interest rates 
as a result of our july issuance of  of notes and depending upon the level of spending in fiscal  we expect to achieve increased investment income in fiscal interest expense of  in fiscal results from our july issuance of  of notes 
annual interest expense is expected to be approximately  which includes approximately  of amortization of debt issuance costs 
impairment of equity securities of  in fiscal reflects the write down of our investment in incara  inc incara to fair value as the decline in incara common stock was deemed other than temporary 
fiscal year ended september  compared to fiscal year ended september our net loss increased  to  or per share  basic  in fiscal from  or per share  basic  in fiscal this increased net loss is primarily the result of a decrease in total revenues of  reflecting primarily the absence of the takeda license revenue  increased research and development expense related to trospium  primarily for a phase iii trial which ended in september  the  credit in fiscal in product withdrawal resulting from the ahp indemnity and release agreement  noncash compensation expense related to a stock option grant and modifications of stock option grants to a director and executive officers of the company  offset by the  charge recognized in fiscal for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle resulting from our adoption of sab see notes c and m of notes to consolidated financial statements

contract and license fee revenue of  in fiscal consisted of a milestone payment from amgen inc amgen related to amgen s continuation of development of leptin receptor technology  funding of pro development from conrad and fhi and other revenue 
contract and license fee revenue of  in fiscal consisted primarily of  related to the takeda agreement  which was recognized when takeda s rights under an option expired on september  of the amount received from takeda   was recognized as revenue in fiscal  deferred upon our 
table of contents adoption of sab and reflected as a  cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in our fiscal results 
this  was recognized as revenue in fiscal upon expiration of takeda s rights under the agreement 
cost of revenues of  and  in fiscal and  respectively  consisted primarily of amounts due or paid to mit for its portion of the sarafem royalty revenue and costs pertaining to the pro development agreements 
research and development expense increased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this increase is primarily due to increased costs in fiscal from our development of trospium  including our person phase iii clinical trial for trospium 
total research and development expenses for fiscal substantially relate to our major compounds being developed as follows trospium  pagoclone  citicoline  ip  and pro  we also incurred research and development expenses for fiscal of  related to dersalazine and other compounds and initiatives 
general and administrative expense increased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this increase was primarily due to noncash compensation charges from modifications in fiscal of stock option grants to a director and executive officers of the company  increased legal costs and pre marketing costs related trospium partially offset by the absence in fiscal of costs related to our lawsuit against wyeth and other decreased compensation related costs 
the product withdrawal net credit of  for the year ended september  consisted of credits of approximately  for redux related accruals reversed in fiscal  as well as for insurance reimbursements of other redux related expenses  partially offset by a reserve for the insurance claim on reliance and a noncash charge for the fair value of stock options granted to attorneys involved in the wyeth litigation 
see note i of notes to consolidated financial statements and item legal proceedings 
investment income decreased  or  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal resulting from substantially reduced market interest rates despite higher average invested cash balances 
impairment of equity securities of  and  in fiscal and  respectively  reflects write downs of our investment in incara to fair value as the decline in incara common stock was deemed other than temporary 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at september   we had consolidated cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of  compared to  at september  this increase of  resulted primarily from approximately  of net proceeds from the issuance of the notes offset by  of cash used by operating activities 
in july  we received net proceeds of approximately  from the issuance of  of notes to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to rule a under the securities act 
the notes are convertible at anytime prior to the july  maturity date into our common stock at an initial conversion price of per share  subject to adjustment for certain events  we have reserved approximately  shares of common stock for issuance pursuant to such a conversion and have registered the notes and common stock with the sec for resale 
additionally  all or a portion of the notes are redeemable by us for cash at any time after july  provided our common stock equals or exceeds of the conversion price then in effect for a specified period and all of the notes are subject to repurchase by us at the option of the note holders if a change 
table of contents in control occurs 
if the notes are not previously converted into common stock  interest of  is payable semiannually in arrears on january and july each year through the maturity date  at which time the principle becomes due and payable 
we are continuing to invest substantial amounts in the ongoing development and pre commercialization activities related to trospium 
we do not currently have sufficient funds to commercialize trospium and are currently in discussions with prospective partners for the commercialization of trospium 
we believe we have sufficient cash for currently planned expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
we will require additional funds or corporate collaborations for the development and commercialization of our other compounds in development  as well as any new businesses  products or technologies acquired or developed in the future 
we have no commitments to obtain such funds 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing to satisfy future cash requirements on acceptable terms  or at all 
if additional funds are not obtained  we will be required to delay product development and business development activities 
product development we expect to continue to expend substantial additional amounts for the development of our products 
in particular  we are continuing to expend substantial funds for trospium  including clinical trials to explore further certain attributes of trospium and the development of extended release formulations 
there can be no assurance that results of any ongoing or future pre clinical or clinical trials will be successful  that additional trials will not be required  that any drug or product under development will receive fda approval in a timely manner or at all  or that such drug or product could be successfully manufactured in accordance with cgmp or successfully marketed in a timely manner  or at all  or that we will have sufficient funds to develop or commercialize any of our products 
we have entered into an agreement with madaus under which we anticipate madaus will manufacture trospium for commercial use provided that it can deliver acceptable product to satisfy us regulatory and market requirements 
although madaus manufactures the product for sale in europe  it has not yet been inspected for compliance with cgmp requirements 
we are working with madaus to prepare for an fda inspection of their german manufacturing plant 
in order to manufacture the product for sale in the united states  madaus manufacturing facility must comply with cgmp 
failure to meet cgmp requirements in a timely manner could cause a material delay in fda approval  if any  and commercialization of trospium 
while we may seek a second source for trospium if madaus is unable to meet all regulatory requirements or provide the necessary quantities of trospium in a timely manner  this could also cause a material delay in fda approval  if any  and commercialization of trospium 
total research and development expenses incurred by us through september  on the major compounds currently being developed  including allocation of corporate general and administrative expenses  are approximately as follows  for trospium   for pagoclone   for citicoline   for pro   for aminocandin and  for ip in june  we re acquired rights to pagoclone from pfizer inc during the period pfizer had rights to pagoclone  pfizer conducted and funded all development activities for pagoclone 
estimating costs and time to complete development of a compound is difficult due to the uncertainties of the development process and the requirements of the fda which could necessitate additional and unexpected clinical trials or other development  testing and analysis 
results of any testing could result in a decision to alter or terminate development of a compound  in which case estimated future costs could change substantially 
certain compounds could benefit from subsidies  grants or government or agency sponsored studies that could reduce our development costs 
in the event we were to enter into a licensing or other collaborative agreement with a corporate partner involving sharing  funding or assumption by such corporate partner of development costs  the estimated development costs to be incurred by us could be substantially less than the estimates below 
additionally  research and development costs are extremely difficult 
table of contents to estimate for early stage compounds due to the fact that there is generally less comprehensive data available for such compounds to determine the development activities that would be required prior to the filing of an nda 
given these uncertainties and other risks  variables and considerations related to each compound and regulatory uncertainties in general  we estimate remaining research and development costs  excluding allocation of corporate general and administrative expenses  from september  through the preparation of an nda for our major compounds currently being developed as follows approximately  for pro  approximately  for ip  approximately  for aminocandin  and approximately  for pagoclone 
in addition  we are continuing to expend substantial funds for trospium 
we do not plan to develop citicoline further without a corporate partner or project specific funding 
we cannot reasonably estimate the date of completion for any compound that is not at least in phase iii clinical development due to the uncertainty of the number of required trials and size of such trials and the duration of development 
we are unable to estimate the date of development completion for citicoline because we do not intend to complete development of citicoline unless a partnership for such development is established 
we are unable to estimate the date of development completion for pagoclone due to the scope complexity and cost of the type of clinical trials necessary which may require the financial assistance of a partner to complete 
actual costs and time to complete any of our products may differ significantly from the estimates 
analysis of cash flows cash used in operating activities during fiscal of  consisted primarily of the net loss of  offset by an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of  and accounts payable of  accrued expenses and other liabilities increased  in fiscal primarily due to increased trospium development and pre marketing activities 
cash used by investing activities during fiscal of  consisted primarily of  of net outflows from purchases of marketable securities 
cash provided by financing activities of  consisted of approximately  of net proceeds from the issuance of the notes and  from the issuance of common stock pursuant to our stock option and purchase plans 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements the following chart summarizes our contractual payment obligations as of september  the notes and license fees are reflected as liabilities on our balance sheet as of september  operating leases are accrued and paid on a monthly basis 
purchase obligations relate to research and development agreements and arrangements and trospium premarketing agreements and arrangements  portions of these amounts are reflected as accrued expenses on our balance sheet as of september  payments due by period contractual obligations less than year years years greater than years total notes operating leases interest on notes license fees purchase obligations total see note h of notes to consolidated financial statements 
see note g of notes to consolidated financial statements 
relates primarily to agreements and purchase orders with contractors for the conduct of clinical trials and other research and development activities and pre marketing activities related to trospium 

table of contents pursuant to certain of our in licensing arrangements  we will owe payments to its licensors upon achievement of certain development  regulatory and licensing milestones 
while we cannot predict if or when such events will occur  depending on the successful achievement of certain development  regulatory and licensing milestones  we may owe up to  in fiscal pursuant to agreements we have with les laboratoires servier  from whom we in licensed rights to redux  boehringer ingelheim pharmaceuticals  inc  the manufacturer of redux  and other parties  we may be required to indemnify such parties for redux related liabilities

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we own financial instruments that are sensitive to market risks as part of our investment portfolio 
the investment portfolio is used to preserve our capital until it is required to fund operations  including our research and development activities 
none of these market risk sensitive instruments are held for trading purposes 
we do not own derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
interest rate risk related to cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  primarily in short term bank deposits  money market funds  and domestic and foreign commercial paper and government securities 
these investments are denominated in us dollars and are subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
our investment portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to help ensure portfolio liquidity and we have implemented guidelines limiting the duration of investments 
due to the conservative nature of these instruments  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk 
risk related to the notes the fair value of our notes is sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates and the price of our common stock into which the notes are convertible 
a decrease in the price of our common stock could result in a decrease in the fair value of the notes 
for example on a very simplified basis  a decrease of of the market value of our common stock could reduce the value of a note by approximately an increase in market interest rates could result in a decrease in the fair value of the notes 
for example on a very simplified basis  an interest rate increase of could reduce the value of a note by approximately the two examples provided above are only hypothetical and actual changes in the value of the notes due to fluctuations in market value of our common stock or interest rates could vary substantially from these examples
