item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations preliminary note regarding forward looking statements the information set forth in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  and is subject to the safe harbor created by that section 
factors that realistically could cause results to differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements are set forth in this section and earlier in this report under business factors that could affect future results beginning on page the following discussion should also be read in conjunction with the financial statements and accompanying notes thereto 
overview we design  develop  market and service high performance computer systems  commonly known as supercomputers 
these systems provide capability and capacity far beyond typical mainframe computer systems and address the world s most challenging computing problems for government  industry and academia 
we expect that most of our product revenue will come from sales of our cray x system  the production version of which first shipped in december in mid  we began a development project with sandia national laboratories to design and deliver a new  high bandwidth  massively parallel processing 
table of contents supercomputer system called red storm in we provide maintenance services to the worldwide installed base of cray computers 
we also offer professional services that leverage our industry technical knowledge 
we experienced net losses in each full year of our operations prior to we incurred net losses of approximately million in  million in  and million in for the year ended december   we had net income of million 
we recognize product revenue from sales of our computer systems upon acceptance by the customer  although in limited circumstances  depending on sales contract terms  revenue may be recognized when title passes upon shipment or may be delayed until funding is certain 
we recognize product revenue from the red storm project using the percentage of completion method 
we recognize service revenue for the maintenance of our computer systems ratably over the term of each maintenance agreement 
funds from maintenance and product sales contracts that are paid in advance are recorded as deferred revenue 
we recognize service revenue from our professional services activities as services are rendered 
factors that should be considered in evaluating our business  operations and prospects and that could affect our future results and financial condition are set forth above under business factors that could affect future results 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion as well as disclosures included elsewhere in this annual report on form k are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingencies 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the estimates used  including those related to estimates of warranty liabilities  valuation of inventory at the lower of cost or market  the percentage complete and estimated gross profit on the red storm contract  and impairment of goodwill 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current conditions and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources as well as identifying and assessing our accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
t reserve we acquired service contracts in the acquisition of the cray research business unit in april for cray t vector computers 
some of the components in the cray t vector computers have an unusually high failure rate 
as of april   the date of our acquisition of the cray research business unit from sgi  we recorded a warranty reserve of million  of which million reflected our estimate of the amount by which the cost of servicing the t vector computers would exceed the revenue generated from servicing them until they were no longer in use by our customers 
as we incur costs to service these computers in excess of the related service revenue  we reduce the amount of the t warranty reserve 
as of december   our total warranty reserve balance was million  of which million related to the t vector computers 
we continually monitor the reasonableness of our estimate of the warranty reserve 
this involves analysis of our assumptions with regard to the length of time the t vector computers will be in use by our customers  the failure rate of modules in the computers considering actual historical failure rates  and personnel and resources  including service spares  that will be required to correct failures that occur in the future 
in determining the appropriate reserve  the company reduced the t reserve and recorded a corresponding reduction to the cost of maintenance revenue of million for year ended december  we believe that the t warranty reserve balance at december   is a reasonable estimate of the extent to which our costs to service these computers will exceed the revenue generated from existing service contracts 
it is 
table of contents possible  however  that our estimates may prove to be inaccurate and that our actual costs may differ materially from our estimates 
red storm contract product revenue from the red storm contract is accounted for using the percentage of completion method 
revenue is recognized as costs are incurred  and margin is based on the total estimated cost to complete 
the estimate to complete is based on several factors  including estimated labor hours to complete certain tasks and estimated cost of purchased components at future dates 
our estimates may need to be adjusted from quarter to quarter  which would impact our revenue and our margin on a cumulative basis 
inventories we record our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we regularly evaluate the technological usefulness of various inventory components 
when it is determined that previously inventoried components do not function as intended in a fully operational system  the costs associated with these components are expensed 
due to rapid changes in technology and the increasing demands of our customers  we are continually developing new products 
as a result  it is possible that older products we have developed may become obsolete or we may sell these products below cost 
when we determine that we will likely not recover the cost of inventory items through future sales  we write down the related inventory to our estimate of its market value 
although we did not write down any inventory for  we recorded million and million of inventory write downs for the years ended december   and  respectively 
because the products we sell have high average sales prices and because a high number of our prospective customers receive funding from us or foreign governments  it is difficult to estimate future sales of our products and the timing of such sales 
it also is difficult to determine whether the cost of our inventories will ultimately be recovered through future sales 
while we believe our inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market and that our estimates and assumptions to determine any adjustments to the cost of our inventories are reasonable  our estimates may prove to be inaccurate 
we have sold inventory previously reduced in part or in whole to zero  and we may have future sales of previously written down inventory 
we may also have additional expense to write down inventory to its estimated market value 
adjustments to these estimates in the future may materially impact our operating results 
goodwill approximately of our assets as of december   consisted of goodwill resulting from our acquisition of the cray research business unit from sgi in as discussed in the recent accounting pronouncements section in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we adopted sfas no 
on january   and we no longer amortize goodwill associated with the acquisition  but we will be required to conduct ongoing analyses of the recorded amount of goodwill in comparison to its estimated fair value 
these ongoing analyses of whether the fair value of recorded goodwill is impaired will involve a substantial amount of judgment 
future charges related to goodwill could be material depending on future developments and changes in technology and our business 
results of operations with the acquisition of the cray research business unit on april   period to period comparisons of our operating results that include periods prior to the acquisition are not meaningful 
product revenue we had product revenue of million for the year ended december   compared to million and million for the respective and periods 
product revenue represented of total revenue for the year ended december   compared to and for the respective and periods  and consisted primarily in the period of million for our cray sv and svex product line  million for our te product line  million for shipments of early production cray x systems  
table of contents million for our mta product line and million for our other products 
product revenue for consisted primarily of million for our sv and svex product line and million for our te product line 
product sales revenue was less than anticipated in due to delays in completing the svex enhancements  with the first complete svex product shipment occurring in late november product revenue in primarily consisted of million for our sv product line and million for our te product line 
product sales for cray research products declined during each of the three years prior to our acquisition of the cray research business unit  primarily because sgi had stopped development funding of new cray research products 
with the delivery of the cray x system to customers and the performance of the red storm project  we expect our product revenue in to increase and be a larger percentage of total revenue 
we expect our product revenue to vary quarterly 
if we lose our distribution rights for nec vector systems in north america  we may experience increased competition for domestic sales of our products 
see business competition 
service revenue we had service revenue  which includes revenue from maintenance services and  beginning in  from professional services  of million for the year ended december   compared to million and million for the respective and periods 
the results include million from professional services  including million for preliminary engineering services on the red storm project for the year ended december  service revenue represented of total revenue for the year ended december   and and for the corresponding and periods 
maintenance services are provided under separate maintenance contracts with our customers 
these contracts generally provide for maintenance services for one year  although some are for multi year periods 
maintenance service revenue has declined on an annual basis as older systems are withdrawn from service 
we expect maintenance service revenue to continue to decline slowly over the next year or so as our older systems continue to be withdrawn from service and then to stabilize as our new systems are placed in service 
professional services are provided under separate contracts for a particular activity such as development  design and study of a new high performance computer system  deinstalling a computer system  porting applications to one of our platforms or use of our computer resources for a particular period  and we expect contracts to vary greatly in size 
we recorded our first revenue from professional services in the first quarter of  and we expect our professional services revenue  adjusted for future reporting of the red storm project as product revenue  to increase modestly 
operating expenses cost of product revenue 
we had cost of product revenue of million for the year ended december   compared to million and million for the respective and periods 
our cost of product represented of product revenue for the year ended december   compared to and for the corresponding and periods 
revenue for the years ended december   and december   includes million and million  respectively  from the sale of obsolete inventory recorded at a zero cost basis 
the high cost of product revenue in is due to the age of the sv and te product lines and inventory adjustments for sv and mta gallium arsenide parts 
we expect that  compared to  our cost of product revenue in will be adversely affected by start up costs incurred in the cray x ramp up and lower margins on the red storm project 
in addition  we may grant favorable pricing for large multi system contracts 
cost of service revenue 
we had cost of service revenue of million for the year ended december   including million of cost of professional services revenue  compared to million and million  respectively  for the corresponding and periods 
our cost of service revenue represented of service revenue for the year ended december   compared to and for the corresponding and periods 
in  cost of maintenance revenue was favorably impacted by a 
table of contents million reduction in warranty reserves  and the overall cost of service revenue was affected by higher costs for professional services revenue due to the start up of those services 
given that maintenance revenue is expected to decline slowly and our professional services revenue will increase only modestly  we expect our overall cost of service revenue to increase to over as a percentage of service revenue for research and development research and development expenses for the years ended december  and reflect our costs associated with the enhancements to the cray sv and te systems in the period and the development of the cray x  and to a lesser extent  the cray mta in both the and periods  including related software development 
research and development expenses for reflect our costs associated with the enhancements to the cray sv and te systems and the development of the cray mta and x systems  including related software development 
research and development expenses also include personnel expenses  allocated overhead and operating expenses  software  materials and engineering expenses  including payments to third parties 
these costs are offset in part by government funding for development and services  including development related to the cray x systems  enhancements and successors to the cray x system and other products  and our efforts on the red storm project 
research and development expenses for  and were as follows in thousands for the years ended december  gross research and development government funding net research and development gross research and development expenditures have continued to decline as we completed the major development work on the cray x system as well as the cray svex and mta systems 
at the same time we have received increased governmental funding for our continued development efforts 
net research and development expenditures represented   and of revenue for   and  respectively 
we expect that gross research and development expenses will increase in to reach or slightly exceed the level as we ramp up our work on the red storm project 
however  we expect that net research and development expenses will remain flat or decline for  primarily due to increased governmental funding 
as a percentage of overall revenue  we expect net research and development expenses to continue to decrease as we expect to increase our overall revenue and receive increased government funding 
marketing and sales marketing and sales expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million and million for the respective and periods 
the increase in these expenses from to was due to the acquisition of the cray research business unit  which required us to re establish the cray sales and customer support staff and increase expenditures in connection with sales and marketing  benchmarks and development of third party applications software 
we expect marketing and sales expenses to grow modestly in  but to decline as a percentage of revenue 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million and million for the respective and periods 
the increase in these expenses from to was due to the acquisition of the cray research operations  which required us to add managerial and administrative staff and to incur increases in legal  accounting and consulting expenses in connection with establishing foreign operations and implementing new accounting systems 
we expect general and administrative expenses to grow modestly in  but to decline as a percentage of revenue 

table of contents restructuring charges restructuring charges were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the period and represent severance expenses related to the termination of employees in and employees in goodwill we incurred no amortization expense for the year ended december   compared to million and million for the and periods 
amortization expense relates to the goodwill resulting from the acquisition of the cray research business unit on april  following the implementation of statement of financial accounting standard no 
 we determined that there was no impairment related to goodwill as of january   and we did not record any amortization of goodwill in see recent accounting pronouncements in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the effect of this accounting change is reflected prospectively from january  supplemental comparative disclosure as if the change had been retroactively applied in prior years is as follows in thousands  except per share amounts years ended december  reported net loss plus goodwill amortization adjusted net loss reported basic and diluted net loss per share plus goodwill amortization adjusted basic and diluted net loss per share other income expense  net other income was million for the year ended december   compared to other expense of  for the period and other income of  for the period 
the increase in other income consisted primarily of a negotiated settlement of an accrued cancellation charge on a purchase commitment 
see accrued loss on purchase commitment in note to the consolidated financial statements 
other income expense for and consisted primarily of realized gains and losses from the effects of foreign currency exchange rates 
interest income expense  net interest income was  for the year ended december   compared to  and  for the respective and periods 
the higher amounts in and reflect our increased average cash position in those years 
interest expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million and million for the respective and periods 
the interest expense for was largely due to a non cash charge of million associated with the convertible debenture financing completed in november  and  of interest paid on our term loan  line of credit and capital leases  while had non cash interest charges of  associated with the value of the conversion feature of certain investor promissory notes and  for the value of options  and just over million of interest paid on our term loan  line of credit and capital leases 
in  we recognized imputed interest expense of approximately million on the non interest bearing note issued to sgi  a non cash interest expense of approximately  associated with the value of the conversion feature of certain investor promissory notes  a non cash expense of  for the value of warrants issued in conjunction with investor promissory notes and  of interest paid on a line of credit and various capital leases 

table of contents taxes we recorded a provision of million for income taxes in foreign countries and certain states for the year ended december   compared to  and  for the respective and periods 
there has been no provision for us federal income taxes for any period 
as of december   we had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million  of which approximately  expires in  none expires in and the balance expires in years through  if not utilized 
net income loss net income was million for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million and million for the respective and periods 
the improvement in net income was due to increased product revenue  lower expenditures  principally net research and development expenses  and the absence of goodwill amortization charges 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and accounts receivable totaled million at december   compared to million at december  over that period  cash increased from million to million  while restricted cash balances  which serve as collateral for capital equipment loans and leases  decreased from  to zero 
at december   we had working capital of million compared to a working capital deficit of million at december  in the first quarter of  we realized approximately million of net proceeds from the public sale of our common stock 
the reduction in net cash used in operating activities for to million compared to million for was primarily due to million of net income for  compared to a net loss of million for for  net operating cash was used primarily by increases in accounts receivable and inventory and decreases in other accrued liabilities  warranty reserve and deferred revenues 
net cash used by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to net cash provided of million in for  net operating cash flows were primarily attributed to our net loss  offset by depreciation and amortization  along with decreases in accounts payable and warranty reserves 
the increase in net cash used in operating activities in over was primarily attributed to the acquisition of the cray research business unit in april of net cash used by investing activities was million for  compared to million for net cash used by investing activities for consisted primarily of purchases of computers and electronic test equipment  computer software and furniture and fixtures 
in  the net cash used in investing activities was primarily for electronic test equipment and computer hardware purchases 
net cash used in investing activities was million for  principally for the cray research acquisition 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for  compared to million for in  we raised million primarily through the sale of common stock and employee option exercises  and received another million through the exercise of warrants that otherwise would have expired 
in  we raised million through the sale of preferred stock to nec  and in november we issued million in convertible subordinated notes 
we also obtained a three year term loan of million in over the next twelve months  our significant cash requirements will relate to operational expenses  consisting primarily of personnel costs  costs of inventory and spare parts as we ramp up production of cray x systems  third party engineering expenses  and acquisition of property and equipment 
our fiscal year capital expenditure budget for property and equipment is estimated currently at million 
in addition  we lease certain equipment used in our operations under operating or capital leases in the normal course of 
table of contents business 
we expect that operations over the next twelve months will generate positive cash flow 
the following table is a summary of our contractual cash obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by periods less than after contractual obligations total year years years years notes payable term loan payable capital lease obligations operating leases total contractual cash obligations at any particular time  given the high average selling price of our products  our cash position is affected by the timing of payment for product sales  receipt of prepaid maintenance revenue and receipt of government funding of research and development activities 
we believe our current cash resources will be adequate for the next twelve months 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk substantially all of our cash equivalents and marketable securities are held in money market funds or commercial paper of less than days that is held to maturity 
accordingly  we believe that the market risk arising from our holdings of these financial instruments is minimal 
we sell our products primarily in north america  but with significant sales in asia and europe 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
our products are generally priced in us dollars  and a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
while we commonly sell products with payments in us dollars  our product sales contracts occasionally call for payment in foreign currencies and to the extent we do so  we are subject to foreign currency exchange risks 
we believe that a change in foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on the financial statements 
our foreign maintenance contracts are paid in local currencies and provide a natural hedge against local expenses 
to the extent that we wish to repatriate any of these funds to the united states  however  we are subject to foreign exchange risks 
we do not hold any derivative instruments and have not engaged in hedging transactions 
at december   we had term loan of million due in bearing annual interest at the rate of prime rate plus  with a minimum rate of 
our payment commitment on the term loan is comprised of a fixed amount of principal plus accrued interest
