the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts  the useful lives of fixed assets  impairment of long lived assets and income taxes 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company generates its revenues primarily from subscriptions and advertising 
subscription revenues represent customer subscriptions that provide subscribers access to investment commentary  advice  research  analysis and news 
subscriptions are generally charged to customers credit cards or are charged directly to companies that subscribe to the service 
these are generally billed in advance on a monthly  quarterly  semi annual or annual basis 
the company calculates net subscription revenues by deducting refunds and cancellation chargebacks from gross revenues 
net subscription revenues are recognized ratably over the subscription period 
deferred revenue liabilities relate to subscription fees for which amounts have been collected but for which revenue has not been recognized 
advertising and e commerce revenue  derived from the sale of internet sponsorship arrangements  and from the delivery of banner and email advertisements on the company s web sites  as well as from conference sponsorships  is recognized ratably over the period the advertising is displayed  provided that no significant company obligations remain and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
although infrequent  company obligations could include guarantees of a minimum number of times that users of the company s web sites click through to the advertisers web site  or take additional specified action  such as opening an account 
in such cases  revenues are recognized as the guaranteed click throughs or other relevant delivery criteria are fulfilled 
other revenues consist primarily of conference attendee revenue  revenue related to james j 
cramer s daily radio program  realmoney with jim cramer  syndication revenues  royalties earned from the company s investing book  reprint revenues  and barter advertising arrangements only for fiscal years in which such arrangements occurred

fair value is determined by the comparable advertising market rates at the time of placement 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its advertisers and subscribers to make required payments 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables  including the current credit worthiness of each customer 
if the financial condition of the company s advertisers and subscribers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost  net of accumulated depreciation and amortization 
property and equipment are depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets three years for computer equipment  including capitalized software and web site development costs  and five years for furniture and fixtures 
leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight line method over the shorter of the respective lease term or the estimated useful life of the asset 
goodwill and other intangible assets in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires companies to stop amortizing goodwill and certain other intangible assets with an indefinite useful life 
instead  goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite useful life will be subject to an annual review for impairment 
separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have indefinite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives but with no maximum life 
upon the adoption of sfas in the first quarter of  the company stopped the amortization of goodwill and certain other intangible assets with an indefinite life  and completed the required transitional fair value impairment test on its goodwill which had no impact on the company s financial statements 
an impairment test was performed again as of september   which also had no impact on the company s financial statements

the company migrated these monthly subscribers to its own commerce system in march and  by the end of the year  had successfully converted many of these monthly subscribers into annual subscribers

the company s quarterly financial results may fluctuate and its future revenues are difficult to forecast and may be seasonal the company s quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors  many of which are outside the company s control  including demand for advertising on the company s web sites and the internet generally  advertising rate reductions and subscription price reductions due to decreased demand or increased competition  advertising budget cycles of the company s customers  the company s success in developing new products or services and the amount and timing of costs associated with that process  the company s ability to enter into new and maintain its current strategic relationships  the amount and timing of the company s costs for marketing and other initiatives  new products or services introduced by the company or its competitors  content distribution fees or other costs incurred by the company  costs associated with system downtime affecting the internet generally or the company s web sites in particular  and general economic and market conditions 
the company forecasts its current and future expense levels based on expected revenues and the company s investment plans 
the company s expenses are largely fixed in nature 
therefore  the company may not be able to adjust its spending fast enough to mitigate losses in the event its revenues decline unexpectedly 
in addition  the company believes that advertising sales in traditional media  such as television and radio  generally are lower in the first and third calendar quarters of each year and that similar seasonal patterns have developed in the company s industry 
the company believes that quarter to quarter comparisons of its operating results may not be a good indication of its future performance  nor would its operating results for any particular quarter be indicative of future operating results 
due to the above factors  the company s operating results may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors in some future quarters 
in such an event  the price of the company s common stock is likely to decline 
the company may have difficulty selling its advertising inventory  a significant portion of which is concentrated among the company s top advertisers although the market for online advertising sales has shown some signs that it is beginning to recover from its severe decline  many factors continue to weigh heavily on it  including the prolonged stock market slump  the declines in business and consumer spending  recent acts of terrorism and the war in iraq  all of which have negatively affected readership of financial market content  such as that produced by the company 
as a result  many advertising supported web sites  particularly those in the financial sector  continue to experience difficulty selling their available inventories and maintaining their rate structures 
although the company believes that its demographic profiles will continue to enable it to maintain its high sell through  its ability to increase its advertising revenues depends on a variety of factors  including general market conditions  seasonal fluctuations in financial news consumption and overall online usage and the company s ability to increase its unique visitors and page view inventory 
if the company is unable to attract the necessary traffic  or if despite such traffic  advertising revenues decrease due to the factors discussed above  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in the fourth quarter of  the company s top five advertisers accounted for approximately of its total advertising and e commerce revenues  excluding conference sponsorship revenues 
for the twelve months ended december   the company s top five advertisers accounted for approximately of its total advertising and e commerce revenues  excluding conference sponsorship revenues  as compared to approximately for the twelve months ended december  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by the loss of a number of its top advertisers  and such a loss could be concentrated in a single quarter 
further  if the company does not continue to increase its revenue from financial services advertisers or attract advertisers from non financial industries  its business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
as is typical in the advertising industry  the company s advertising contracts have short notice cancellation provisions 
a general decline in online advertising or commercial email could harm the company s business the company s future success is dependent in part on the use of the internet as an advertising medium 
the internet advertising industry continues to evolve  and it cannot yet be compared with traditional advertising media to gauge its effectiveness  particularly from a branding perspective 
as a result  demand and market acceptance for internet advertising solutions is uncertain and its growth has slowed significantly 
the adoption of internet advertising  particularly by those entities that have historically relied upon traditional media for advertising  requires the acceptance of a new way of conducting business  exchanging information and advertising products and services 
some of these customers may find internet advertising to be less effective for promoting their products and services relative to traditional advertising media 
the company cannot assure you that current or potential advertising customers will continue to allocate a portion of their advertising budget to internet advertising or that the demand for internet advertising will continue to develop to sufficiently support internet advertising as a significant advertising medium 
if the demand for internet advertising decreases  then the company s business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
moreover  filter software programs that limit or prevent advertising from being delivered to a web user s computer are available 
widespread adoption of this software could materially adversely affect the commercial viability of web advertising  which could materially adversely affect the company s advertising revenues 
in addition  some internet commentators  privacy advocates and federal and state officials have suggested that legislation may be needed to better safeguard online privacy  by the limitation or elimination of the use of cookies  by so called opt in requirements that permit the sharing of personal information only if consumers have actively agreed to it  or by other methods 
if such legislation is passed  it is likely to restrict the ability of online advertisers to target their ads  which may result in a decrease in online advertising rates or online advertising spending generally 
such a decrease could materially adversely affect the company s advertising revenues 
the company also derives advertising revenues from email advertising and other email services including the marketing of its own products via email  which exposes it to potential liabilities or claims resulting from unsolicited email  lost or misdirected messages  illegal or fraudulent use of email  privacy violations or interruptions or delays in email service 
recently  many internet service providers  or isps  have implemented aggressive campaigns to reduce the use of unsolicited commercial email  popularly known as spam  on their networks 
although the company believes that its email advertising practices are in compliance with applicable laws and policies  if one or more isps were to deem the company s email advertising and marketing practices to be violative of their anti spam policies  their technology could be used to block or limit the company s advertising and marketing efforts 
the occurrence of any of the foregoing could materially adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company competes with other web sites  television  radio and print media for a share of advertisers total advertising budgets 
if advertisers perceive the web in general or the company s web sites in particular to be a limited or an ineffective advertising medium  they may be reluctant to devote a portion of their advertising budget to online advertising or to advertising on the company s web sites 
the company may have difficulty adding subscribers and retaining current subscribers the company continues to seek to retain its current subscribers and to attract new subscribers 
as of december   the company had approximately  paid annual and monthly subscribers not including free trials  but including an estimate of subscribers paid for as part of certain bulk deals to subscription products  as compared to approximately  such subscribers to subscription products as of december  the company believes it has significantly enhanced its subscription offerings to differentiate them from the free financial and investing information that is widely available on the web  including on thestreet 
com site 
however  given the availability of such free financial information  the company may not be able to retain its current subscribers and attract additional subscribers in a cost effective manner 
if the company s subscription base declines significantly or the cost of subscriber acquisition increases  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
difficulties in developing new and enhanced products and services could harm the company s business in  the company introduced additional products and services and enhanced existing products and services designed to help retain its current subscribers and attract new subscribers 
the company intends to do more of the same in however  if the company introduces a product or service that is not favorably received  its current readers may choose a competitive service over the company s 
the company may also experience difficulties that could delay or prevent it from introducing new products and services  or the new products or services the company introduces could contain errors that are discovered after they are introduced 
in some cases  the company is dependent on third parties  including software companies  application service providers and technology consulting firms  to help the company develop and implement new products and services 
if these third parties are not able to fulfill their responsibilities to the company on schedule or if the technology developed by them for the company s use does not function as anticipated  implementation may be delayed and the cost of implementation may be higher than anticipated 
such developments could materially adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
because the company is in the early stages of developing its proprietary equity research business  the company is subject to risks and uncertainties associated with developing and operating a new business and may not achieve profitability in this new business in october  the company formed independent research group llc as a wholly owned subsidiary to operate its proprietary equity research business 
irg expects to begin coverage of equities in the second quarter of since its formation  irg has incurred start up costs and expenses  but has not yet generated any revenues 
the company will encounter risks  uncertainties  expenses and difficulties as it proceeds to develop and operate this new business  including  among others  those relating to licensing  staffing  regulatory compliance and gaining market acceptance of its products 
the limited operating history of irg makes it difficult to evaluate the business and its prospects or to accurately predict future revenues or results of operations for the business 
accordingly  the prospects for this business should be considered in light of the risks  uncertainties  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in an early stage of development 
the company can make no assurances that it will successfully develop and operate its proprietary equity research business or achieve profitability for this business 
irg s revenues may not be sufficient to cover its expenses irg s current business plan involves only the production of proprietary equity research and the dissemination of that research to institutional money managers and hedge funds at no charge to these customers 
in return  irg expects that these institutional money managers and hedge funds will voluntarily elect to execute transactions through irg s correspondent clearing broker and direct to irg a portion of commissions reasonable in relation to the value of the research provided by irg 
these arrangements are subject to various regulatory requirements 
see business marketing professional marketing soft dollar brokers 
irg does not expect to conduct other revenue generating activities at this time 
because there is no guarantee that revenues will be generated in connection with its proprietary equity research  the company can make no assurances that irg s revenues will be sufficient to cover its expenses 
the company s success in developing and operating its proprietary equity research business will depend in part on the demand for equity investment in the marketplace the company s ability to develop and operate its proprietary equity research business will depend in part on the strength of the market for equity securities generally 
recently  the market for equity securities has been depressed due to factors beyond the company s control  including the adverse effects of current general economic conditions  recent acts of terrorism and the war in iraq 
these events may have a material adverse affect on demand for the company s proprietary equity research 
if the company does not develop and maintain an effective sales force its business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected the company depends upon its sales force to sell advertising on  and subscriptions for  its web sites and other products 
the company has experienced in the past  and may experience in the future  costly  high turnover in the ranks of its sales force 
in addition to replacement costs  this exposes the company to risks of competition from other companies in hiring and retaining qualified sales personnel  decreased productivity during training and orientation periods  and potential failure to integrate and motivate new and existing sales personnel 
if the company is unable to attract and retain qualified sales representatives  its business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
unforeseen development difficulties may hinder the company s efforts over the past two years  the company has significantly enhanced its design and its technological infrastructure to further improve its sites and to accommodate increased traffic  and intends to continue such development activities 
however  unforeseen development difficulties could prevent the company from implementing such improvements or cause the costs to implement such improvements  including design  technology and related costs  to be higher than anticipated 
in the past  the company has experienced significant spikes in traffic on its web sites when there have been important financial news events 
accordingly  the company s web sites must accommodate a high volume of traffic  often at unexpected times 
although the company has upgraded and continues to improve its systems  the company s web sites have in the past  and may in the future  experience publishing problems  slower response times than usual or other problems for a variety of reasons 
these occurrences could cause the company s readers to perceive its web sites as not functioning properly and  therefore  cause them to use other methods to obtain their financial news and information 
in such a case  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the company faces a risk of system failure that may result in reduced traffic  reduced revenue and harm to its reputation the company s ability to provide timely information and continuous news updates depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of its computer and communications hardware and software systems 
similarly  the company s ability to track  measure and report the delivery of advertisements on its site depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of a third party system 
in february  in connection with the acquisition of the assets of exodus communications  inc by cable wireless plc  a global telecommunications company headquartered in great britain  the company s june internet hosting agreement with exodus was assumed by cable wireless 
the company s operations depend on the ability of cable wireless to protect its own systems and the company s systems in its data center against damage from fire  power loss  water damage  telecommunications failure  acts of terrorism  vandalism and similar unexpected adverse events 
although cable wireless provides comprehensive facilities management services  including human and technical monitoring of all production servers hours per day  seven days per week  cable wireless does not guarantee that the company s internet access will be uninterrupted  error free or secure 
any disruption in the internet access to the company s web sites provided by cable wireless could materially adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company s own internal systems and operations  as well as those of cable wireless  may be subject to damage or interruption from human error  natural disasters  fire  water damage  power loss  telecommunication failures  acts of terrorism  break ins  sabotage  computer viruses  intentional acts of vandalism and similar events 
any system failure  including network  software or hardware failure  that causes an interruption in the company s service or a decrease in responsiveness of its web sites could result in reduced traffic  reduced revenue and harm to the company s reputation  brand and the company s relations with its advertisers and e commerce partners 
like most web sites  the company may be vulnerable to computer viruses  physical or electronic break ins and other deliberate attempts to disrupt its technological operations  which could lead to interruptions  delays or loss of data 
in addition  unauthorized persons may improperly access the company s data 
the company s insurance policies may not adequately compensate the company for any losses that the company may incur because of any failures in its system or interruptions in its delivery of content 
the company s business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by any event  damage or failure that interrupts or delays the company s operations 
the company s future success depends on its ability to attract and retain key personnel the company s future success depends upon its ability to attract and retain key personnel  including executives  editors  writers  and technology personnel 
certain of the company s key employees are bound by employment or non competition agreements 
the loss of one or more of the company s key personnel  or the company s inability to attract replacements with appropriate expertise  could materially adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
intense competition could reduce the company s market share and harm its financial performance as our business has expanded into new areas  such as equity research and advisory reports  we face competition for customers  advertisers  employees and contributors not only with financial news and information sources  but also with many types of companies  including online services or web sites focused on business  finance  or investing such as the wall street journal interactive edition www 
wsj 
com  dowjones 
com  forbes 
com  smartmoney 
com  cbs 
marketwatch 
com and the motley fool  publishers and distributors of traditional media focused on finance and investing  including print and radio  such as the wall street journal and financial talk radio programs  investment newsletter publishers such as phillips publishing  kci communications and agora publishing  information and analysis providers such as standard poors  and those involved in the creation and production of investor education conferences 
the company  through irg  is a new entrant into the proprietary equity research business 
as a result  the company will face significant competition from established wall street investment banking firms  large financial institutions  equity research boutiques and other securities professionals that offer similar information and that have firmly established customer relationships 
the company cannot guarantee that it will be able to compete effectively with its current or future competitors or that this competition will not significantly harm its business 
the company s ability to compete depends on many factors  including the independence  insightfulness  trustworthiness and timeliness of its content and that of the company s competitors  the success of the company s recommendations and research  the ease of use of services developed either by the company or its competitors and the effectiveness of the company s sales and marketing efforts 
many of the company s existing competitors  as well as a number of potential new competitors  have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger customer bases and significantly greater financial  technical and marketing resources than the company does 
this may allow them to devote greater resources than the company can to the development and promotion of their services 
these competitors may also engage in more extensive research and development  undertake more far reaching marketing campaigns  adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to existing and potential employees  outside contributors  strategic partners and advertisers 
the company s competitors may develop content that is equal or superior to the company s or that achieves greater market acceptance than the company s 
it is also possible that new competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
the company may not be able to compete successfully for customers  advertisers  employees and contributors  which could materially adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced margins or loss of market share  any of which could materially adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company also competes with other web sites  television  radio  print media and conference providers for a share of advertisers total advertising budgets 
if advertisers perceive the internet or the company s web sites to be a limited or an ineffective advertising medium  they may be reluctant to devote a portion of their advertising budget to internet advertising or to advertising on the company s web sites 
a failure to establish and maintain strategic relationships with other companies could decrease the company s subscriber and reader base  which may harm the company s business the company depends on establishing and maintaining content syndication and headline indexing relationships with high traffic web sites for a significant portion of its current subscriber and reader base 
there is intense competition for relationships with these firms and placement on these sites  and the company may have to pay significant fees to establish additional content syndication and headline indexing relationships with large  high traffic partners or maintain existing relationships in the future 
the company may be unable to enter into or successfully renew relationships with these firms or sites on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
these relationships may not attract significant numbers of subscribers or readers 
many companies that the company may approach for a strategic relationship or who already have strategic relationships with the company also provide investment commentary  advice  research  analysis or news from other sources 
as a result  these companies may be reluctant to enter into or maintain strategic relationships with the company 
the company s business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if the company does not establish additional  and maintain existing  strategic relationships on commercially reasonable terms or if any of the company s strategic relationships do not result in an increase in the number of subscribers or readers of its web sites and other products 
the company may be unable to grow through acquisitions and integrate future acquisitions into its business the company s growth strategy may involve acquisitions of other companies 
however  the company may be unable to successfully pursue and complete acquisitions in a timely and cost effective manner 
further  the pursuit and integration of acquisitions will require substantial attention from the company s senior management  which will limit the amount of time these individuals will have available to devote to the company s existing operations 
there can be no assurance that the company would be able to successfully integrate these acquisitions into its business or implement its plans without delay or substantial cost 
in addition  future acquisitions by the company could result in the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities  which could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
any failure or any inability to effectively manage and integrate growth could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
difficulties associated with the company s brand development may harm its ability to attract subscribers and readers the company believes that maintaining and growing awareness about the thestreet 
com and realmoney brands  among others  is an important aspect of its efforts to continue to attract users 
the company s new products do not have widely recognized brands  and the company will need to increase awareness of these brands among potential users 
although the company s efforts to build brand awareness have been successful with respect to certain of the company s brands  they may not be cost effective or successful in the future in reaching potential users  and some potential users may not be receptive to the company s advertising campaign or other efforts 
accordingly  the company cannot assure you that such efforts will be successful in raising awareness of thestreet 
com  realmoney or other brands or in persuading potential users to subscribe to the company s products or visit the company s sites 
failure to maintain the company s reputation for trustworthiness may reduce the number of its readers  which may harm its business it is very important that the company maintains its reputation as a trustworthy organization 
the occurrence of events  including the company s misreporting a news story  the non disclosure of a stock ownership position by one or more of the company s writers  the manipulation of a security by one or more of the company s outside contributors  or other breach of the company s compliance policies  could harm the company s reputation for trustworthiness 
these events could result in a significant reduction in the number of the company s readers  which could materially adversely affect its business  results of operations and financial condition 
potential liability for information displayed on the company s web sites may require it to defend against legal claims  which may cause significant operational expenditures the company may be subject to claims for defamation  libel  copyright or trademark infringement or based on other theories relating to the information the company publishes on its web sites or in other media 
these types of claims have been brought  sometimes successfully  against online services as well as other print publications in the past 
the company could also be subject to claims based upon the content that is accessible from its web sites through links to other web sites 
the company s insurance may not adequately protect it against these claims 
failure to protect the company s intellectual property rights could harm its brand building efforts and ability to compete effectively to protect the company s rights to its intellectual property  the company relies on a combination of trademark and copyright law  trade secret protection  confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements with its employees  affiliates  customers  strategic partners and others 
the protective steps the company has taken may be inadequate to deter misappropriation of its proprietary information 
the company may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of  or take appropriate steps to enforce  its intellectual property rights 
the company has registered several trademarks in the united states and also has pending us applications for other trademarks 
failure to adequately protect the company s intellectual property could harm its brand  devalue its proprietary content and affect its ability to compete effectively 
further  defending the company s intellectual property rights could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources  which could materially adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company may have to defend against intellectual property infringement claims  which may cause significant operational expenditures although the company believes that its proprietary rights do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of others  other parties may assert infringement claims against the company or claims that the company has violated a patent or infringed a copyright  trademark or other proprietary right belonging to them 
the company incorporates licensed third party technology in some of its services 
in these license agreements  the licensors have generally agreed to defend  indemnify and hold the company harmless with respect to any claim by a third party that the licensed software infringes any patent or other proprietary right 
the company cannot assure you that these provisions will be adequate to protect it from infringement claims 
any infringement claims  even if not meritorious  could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources on the company s part  which could materially adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company s ability to maintain and increase its customer base depends in large part on the continued growth in use and efficient operation of the web the web based information market continues to evolve 
the company s business would be materially adversely affected if web usage does not continue to grow or grows slowly 
web usage may be inhibited for a number of reasons  such as inadequate network infrastructure  security and privacy concerns  inconsistent quality of service  and unavailability of cost effective  high speed access to the internet 
the company s readers depend on internet service providers  online service providers and other web site operators for access to its web sites 
many of these companies providing such services have filed for bankruptcy 
many have experienced significant service outages in the past and could experience service outages  delays and other difficulties due to system failures unrelated to the company s systems 
these occurrences could cause the company s readers to perceive the web in general or the company s web sites in particular as an unreliable medium and  therefore  cause them to use other media to obtain their financial news and information 
the company also depends on a number of information providers to deliver information and data feeds to it on a timely basis 
the company s web sites could experience disruptions or interruptions in service due to the failure or delay in the transmission or receipt of this information  which could materially adversely affect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
government regulation and legal uncertainties internet communications  commerce and privacy regulation 
existing domestic and international laws or regulations and private industry guidelines specifically regulate communications or commerce on the web 
further  laws and regulations that address issues such as user privacy  pricing  online content regulation  taxation of e commerce transactions and the characteristics and quality of online products and services are under consideration by federal  state  local and foreign governments and agencies and by private industry groups 
several telecommunications companies have petitioned the federal communications commission to regulate internet service providers and online services providers in a manner similar to the regulation of long distance telephone carriers and to impose access fees on such companies 
the governments of other states or foreign countries might attempt to regulate the company s transmissions or levy sales or other taxes relating to the company s activities 
these regulations  if imposed  could increase the cost of transmitting data over the web 
in addition  the growth and development of the market for internet commerce may prompt calls for more stringent consumer protection laws  both in the united states and abroad  that may impose additional burdens on companies conducting business over the internet 
the company s business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected by the adoption or modification of laws or regulations relating to the internet 
the company is also subject to various federal and state regulations concerning the collection and use of information regarding individuals 
these laws include the children s online privacy protection act  and state laws that limit or preclude the use of voter registration and drivers license information  as well as other laws that govern the collection and use of consumer credit and financial information  including the gramm leach bliley act 
although the company s compliance with applicable federal and state laws  regulations and industry guidelines has not had a material adverse effect on it  governments  trade associations and industry self regulatory groups may enact more burdensome laws  regulations and guidelines  including antitrust and consumer privacy laws  affecting the company and its customers 
during the past two years  the us federal and various state governments have investigated certain internet companies regarding their use of personal information and have proposed limitations on the collection and use of information regarding internet users including  for example  a prohibition on the sharing of personal information absent explicit consumer agreement  or opt in 
the european union has enacted its own privacy regulations  which have resulted in limits on the collection and use of certain information from users in europe 
other jurisdictions may follow 
the company could incur additional expenses if any new regulations regarding the use of personal information are introduced or if the company were required to defend its privacy practices against agency investigations 
also  as a consequence of governmental legislation or regulation or enforcement efforts or evolving standards of fair information collection practices  the company may be required to make changes to its products or services in ways that could diminish the effectiveness of the product or service or its attractiveness to potential customers  which could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
laws and regulations directly applicable to internet communications  commerce and advertising are becoming more prevalent  and new laws and regulations are under consideration by the us congress and state legislatures 
any legislation enacted or restrictions arising from current or future government investigations or policy could dampen the growth in use of the internet generally and decrease the acceptance of the internet as a communications  commercial and advertising medium 
the laws governing the internet remain largely unsettled  even in areas where there has been some legislative action 
moreover  it may take years to determine the extent to which existing laws relating to issues such as intellectual property ownership and infringement  libel  obscenity and personal privacy apply to the internet  internet publishing and internet advertising 
any new laws or regulations relating to the delivery of the company s products and services  the dissemination of commercial email advertising and marketing messages  or certain application or interpretation of existing laws  could decrease the growth in the use of the internet  decrease the demand for the company s products and services  reduce the company s ability to market its products and services  or otherwise materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
securities industry regulation 
over the past two years  the company s activities have evolved to include  among other things  the offering of stand alone products providing stock recommendations and analysis to subscribers  in contrast to providing such advice as part of a larger online financial publication of more general and regular circulation 
as a result  the company registered in with the sec as an investment advisor under the investment advisers act of in addition  irg has applied for registration with the sec and for membership in the nasd as a broker dealer in connection with its proposed activities as an introducing broker and provider of proprietary and third party research 
the securities industry in the united states is subject to extensive regulation under both federal and state laws 
a failure to comply with regulations applicable to securities industry participants could materially and adversely affect the company s and irg s business  results of operations and financial condition 
investment advisors such as the company are subject to sec regulations covering all aspects of the operation of their business  including  among others advertising  record keeping  conduct of directors  officers and employees  and supervision of advisory activities 
likewise  broker dealers are subject to regulations of the sec  state regulators and self regulatory organizations  such as the nasd  covering all aspects of the operation of their business  including  among others recommendations of securities  equity research  execution of customers orders  capital structure  record keeping  advertising  conduct of directors  officers and employees  and supervision of securities and research activities 
violations of the regulations governing the actions of investment advisors and broker dealers may result in the revocation of such licenses  the imposition of censures or fines  the issuance of cease and desist orders  and the suspension or expulsion of a firm  its officers  or its employees from the securities business 
the company and irg s ability to comply with all applicable securities laws and rules is largely dependent on its establishment and maintenance of appropriate compliance systems including proper supervisory procedures and books and records requirements  as well as its ability to attract and retain qualified compliance personnel 
furthermore  because the company and irg operate in industries subject to extensive regulation  new regulation  changes in existing regulation  or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules can have a significant impact on the company and irg s ability to compete in the securities industry 
for example  the recent enactment of the sarbanes oxley act of and other actions by various regulatory authorities and industry organizations impose significant new requirements on broker dealers and securities analysts issuing research reports on equity securities and their supervisors 
the new requirements include an obligation to disclose conflicts and prohibitions designed to promote objectivity and independence of the securities analyst 
the company does not expect these changes to materially adversely affect its business plan for irg 
however  the company cannot guarantee that the sec or other federal and state governmental regulatory authorities and self regulatory organizations regulating the actions of broker dealers and investment advisors will not further regulate  or change existing legislation affecting  the company and irg s business in the future in a manner that could harm the company and irg s business  results of operations and financial condition

any failure of the company s internal security measures or breach of its privacy protections could cause the company to lose users and subject it to liability users who subscribe to one of the company s subscription based products are required to furnish certain personal information including name  mailing address  phone number  email address and credit card information  which the company uses to administer its services 
additionally  the company has implemented a registration system that collects certain information although not payment information from users of its free flagship site who wish to gain access to certain features of the company s site 
if the security measures that the company uses to protect personal information are ineffective  the company may lose users and the company s business may be harmed 
additionally  the company relies on security and authentication technology licensed from third parties to perform real time credit card authorization and verification 
the company cannot predict whether technological developments or human error could allow these security measures to be circumvented 
the company may need to use significant resources to prevent security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by any security breaches 
if the company is not able to prevent all security breaches  its business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the company s users depend on the company to keep their personal information private and to not disclose it to third parties 
the company therefore maintains a privacy policy  under which  with certain limited exceptions  it will not disclose to any third parties any personal information about its subscribers or other users 
the company has retained the ability to modify the privacy policy at any time 
if the company s users perceive that the company is not protecting their privacy  its business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
concerns about web security could reduce the company s advertising revenues  decrease its reader base and increase its web security expenditures concern about the transmission of confidential information over the internet has been a significant barrier to electronic commerce and communications over the web 
any well publicized compromise of security could deter more people from using the web or from using it to conduct transactions that involve the transmission of confidential information  such as signing up for a paid subscription  executing stock trades or purchasing goods or services 
because many of the company s advertisers seek to advertise on its web sites to encourage people to use the web to purchase goods or services  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected if internet users significantly reduce their use of the web because of security concerns 
the company may also incur significant costs to protect it against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these breaches 
control by principal stockholders  officers and directors could adversely affect the company s stockholders the company s officers  directors and greater than five percent stockholders and their affiliates  acting together  have the ability to control substantially all matters submitted to its stockholders for approval including the election and removal of directors and any merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of the company s assets and to control its management and affairs 
accordingly  this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of the company  impeding a merger  consolidation  takeover or other business combination involving the company or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the company  which in turn could materially adversely affect the market price of the common stock
