residential customers accounted for of revenues  commercial  industrial and municipalities  and other 
in addition  the company sold  mwh through non firm wholesale contracts in generating revenue of million 
generating capacity installed generating capacity as of december  was rated at  mw 
coal fired generating units provide  mw of capacity  and gas or oil fired turbines used for peaking or emergency conditions provide mw 
new peaking capacity of mw fueled by natural gas was added during and was available for the summer peaking season 
in addition to its generating capacity  throughout the company had mw available under firm contracts and mw available under interruptible contracts 
on january   a mw firm contract expired and was no longer required and therefore not renewed 
the company has interconnections with louisville gas and electric company  cinergy services  inc  indianapolis power light company  hoosier energy rural electric cooperative  inc  big rivers electric corporation  wabash valley power association  and the city of jasper  indiana  providing the historic ability to simultaneously interchange approximately mw 
however  the ability of the company to effectively utilize the electric transmission grid in order to achieve import export capability may be impacted because the company  as a member of the midwest independent system operator miso  has turned over operational control over the interchange facilities and its own transmission assets like many other midwestern electric utilities to the miso

total load for each of the years through at the time of the system summer peak  and the related reserve margin  is presented below in mw 
date of summer peak load total load at peak      generating capability      firm purchase supply interruptible contracts total power supply capacity      reserve margin at peak the total load at peak is increased mw in    and from the total load actually experienced 
the additional mw represents load that would have been incurred if summer cycler programs had not been activated 
the mw is also included in the interruptible contract portion of the company s total power supply capacity 
on the date of peak in  summer cycler programs were not activated 
the winter peak load of the season of approximately mw occurred on march  and was lower than the previous winter peak load of approximately mw which occurred on december  the company maintains a interest in the ohio valley electric corporation ovec 
the ovec is comprised of several electric utility companies  including sigeco and supplies power requirements to the united states department of energy s doe uranium enrichment plant near portsmouth  ohio 
the participating companies are entitled to receive from ovec  and are obligated to pay for  any available power in excess of the doe contract demand 
at the present time  the doe contract demand is essentially zero 
because of this decreased demand  the company s interest in the ovec makes available approximately mw of capacity  in addition to its generating capacity  for use in other operations 
fuel costs and purchased power electric generation for was fueled by coal and natural gas 
oil was used only for testing of gas oil fired peaking units 
there are substantial coal reserves in the southern indiana area  and coal for coal fired generating stations has been supplied from operators of nearby indiana coal mines including those owned by vectren fuels  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
approximately million tons of coal was purchased for generating electricity during of this amount  vectren fuels  inc supplied million tons from its mines and third party purchases 
the average cost of coal consumed in generating electrical energy for the years through follows year avg 
cost per ton mwh the company will also purchase power as needed from the wholesale market to supplement its generation capabilities in periods of peak demand  however  the majority of power purchased through the wholesale market is used to optimize and hedge the company s sales to non firm wholesale customers 
volumes purchased in totaled  mwh
