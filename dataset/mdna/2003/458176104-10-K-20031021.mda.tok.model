we plan to integrate the new technologies we obtain from this acquisition into our existing product lines 
we believe that the new products resulting from the combination of the spontaneous technology s svpn and our enterprise intellisync server will enable our enterprise customers to provide mobile device users with access to corporate data and applications securely and efficiently through existing corporate network infrastructure 
as a result of achieving certain revenue and cash flow goals established by our board of directors in september  certain outstanding options to purchase our common stock issued to executive officers were accelerated in august on september   we entered into a definitive merger agreement to purchase all of the issued and outstanding stock of synchrologic  inc headquartered in alpharetta  georgia

on august   the united states district court for the northern district of california the court issued a claim construction order  interpreting the scope of the patent claims we made against extended 
table of contents systems from the july  claims construction hearing 
extended systems has requested that three of the patents in dispute be re examined by the patent and trademark office pto 
the pto has issued initial office actions  rejecting our claims under the three patents 
we are responding to the patent office actions 
on august   the court heard and rejected extended systems request to stay the case with respect to the three patents involved in reexamination proceedings 
the court encouraged the parties to maintain the april  trial schedule 
fact discovery was completed on september   fact witness depositions ended on october   expert depositions will end on december   and preparation for the trial will continue through april estimates  assumptions and critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto set forth in part iv of this annual report on form k 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions  which we review with our audit committee 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon various factors and information available to us at the time that these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made 
these factors and information may include  but are not limited to  history and prior experience  experience of other enterprises in the same industry  new related events  current economic conditions and information from third party professionals 
the estimates  judgments and assumptions we make can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates  judgments or assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
we use estimates in accounting for  among other things  various revenue contracts  returns  recoverability of long lived assets and investments  restructuring accruals  contingencies  allowances for uncollectible receivables  and depreciation and amortization 
the significant accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following license and service revenue recognition 
revenue from license fees is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of the product has occurred  no significant company obligations with regard to implementation or integration exist  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
arrangements for which the fees are not deemed probable for collection are recognized upon cash collection 
arrangements for which the fees are not deemed fixed or determinable are recognized in the period they become due 
if we were to assess the collectibility of fees differently  the timing and amount of our revenue recognition might differ substantially from previously estimated or reported 
services revenue primarily comprises revenue from consulting fees  maintenance contracts and training 
services revenue from consulting and training is recognized as the service is performed 
maintenance contracts include the right to unspecified upgrades and ongoing support 
maintenance revenue is deferred and recognized ratably as services are provided over the maintenance period 
if we were to allocate more or less value to the unspecified upgrades and ongoing support  the timing of our revenue recognition might differ substantially from that previously reported 
for contracts with multiple elements  and for which vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for the undelivered elements exists  revenue is recognized for the delivered elements based upon the residual contract value as prescribed by the american institute of certified public accountants in statement of position sop no 
 modification of sop no 
with respect to certain transactions 
we have accumulated relevant information from contracts to use in determining the availability of vendor specific objective evidence and believe that such information complies with the criteria established in sop no 
 software revenue recognition which provides guidance on generally accepted accounting principles for recognizing revenue on software transactions 
if we were to allocate the respective fair 
table of contents values of the aforementioned elements differently  the timing of our revenue recognition might differ substantially from that previously estimated or reported 
license and service revenue associated with contracts that involve significant implementation of customization of services  which are essential to the functionality of the software  is recognized over the period of each engagement  primarily using the percentage of completion method 
labor hours incurred is generally used as the measure of progress towards completion as prescribed by sop no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain product type contracts 
revenue for these arrangements is classified as license revenue and service revenue based upon estimates of fair value of each element  and the revenue is recognized based on the percentage of completion ratio for the arrangement 
recognized revenue is subject to revisions as the engagement progresses to completion 
revisions in estimates or estimated losses on engagements are made in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated 
considerable judgment  such as the scope of work and reliance on the customer or other vendors to fulfill some tasks  may be required in determining estimates to complete an engagement 
if we were to make different judgments or utilize different estimates of the total amount of work required to complete the engagement  the timing of our revenue recognition from period to period  as well as the related margins  might differ substantially from that previously estimated or reported 
we consider a project completed at the go live date 
when we sell additional licenses  we recognize revenue after the go live date if the products or seats have been delivered and no remaining obligations exist 
channel inventory and product returns 
the primary sales channel into which we sell our products is a network of distributors and value added resellers in north america  europe  asia pacific  south america and africa 
agreements with our distributors and resellers contain specific product return privileges for stock rotation and obsolete products that are generally limited to contractual amounts 
reserves for estimated future returns are provided for upon revenue recognition 
product returns are recorded as a reduction of revenues 
accordingly  we have established a product returns reserve composed of of product inventories held at our distribution partners  as well as an estimated amount for returns from customers of our distributors and other resellers as a result of stock rotation and obsolete products  among others 
we evaluate our product returns reserve on a quarterly basis 
in estimating our product returns reserve  we evaluate the following factors our demand forecast by product in each of our principal geographic markets  which is affected by our product release schedule  seasonal trends  and analyses developed by our internal sales and marketing group  historical product returns and inventory levels on a product by product basis  current inventory levels and sell through data on a product by product basis as reported to us by our major distributors worldwide on a monthly basis  risk associated with recognizing revenue on individual customers  based on facts and circumstances  timing of planned stock rotation  and general economic conditions 
in general  we would expect product returns to increase following the announcement of new or upgraded versions of our products or in anticipation of such product announcements  as our distributors and resellers seek to reduce their inventory levels of the prior version of a product in advance of receiving the new version 
similarly  we would expect that product inventory held by our distributors and resellers would increase following the successful introduction of new or upgraded products  as these resellers stock the new version in anticipation of demand 
in assessing the appropriateness of product inventory levels held by our resellers and the impact on potential product returns  we may limit sales to our distributors 
table of contents and resellers in order to maintain inventory levels deemed by management to be appropriate 
we generally estimate and provide product returns reserve based on anticipated level of returns and the criteria noted above 
accordingly  actual product returns may differ from our estimates and may have a material adverse effect on our revenues and consolidated results of operations in future periods due to factors including  but not limited to  market conditions and product release cycles 
valuation of goodwill  other intangibles  investments and other long lived assets 
we have accumulated over the years a significant amount of goodwill  other intangible assets  long term investments and other long lived assets as a result of our investments and acquisitions 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of acquired businesses over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired and  effective august   is tested for impairment at least annually and written down only when impaired 
identifiable intangible assets result from the application of the purchase method of accounting for our acquisitions 
our identifiable intangible assets as of july   were composed of our unamortized developed technology  patents  trademark  customer base  covenant not to compete  and customer contracts 
developed technology  patents and customer base are amortized over the period of benefit  generally four years 
trademarks are amortized over the period of benefit of three years 
covenant not to compete and customer contracts are amortized over the period of benefit of the respective covenant or contracts  ranging from nine months to two years 
the ongoing evaluation for impairment of certain identifiable intangibles  investments and long lived assets requires significant management estimation and judgment 
we evaluate the carrying value of these assets for impairment  when events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the underlying asset may not be recoverable 
in addition  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires us to test goodwill annually using a two step process 
the first step is to identify a potential impairment 
the second step measures the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
intangible assets with indefinite lives will be tested for impairment using a one step process that compares the fair value to the carrying amount of the asset 
changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets  changes in overall business strategy  negative industry or economic trends  and decline in stock price and market capitalization may trigger an impairment review for certain intangibles 
poor operating results of underlying investments or adverse changes in market conditions may result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of investments 
changes in market value of the assets  physical changes and continuing operating or cash flow losses associated with assets used to generate revenue may suggest problems of recoverability for certain long lived assets 
whenever the evaluation demonstrates that the carrying amount of an intangible  investment or any other long lived asset is not recoverable  an impairment charge may be required 
as of july   our goodwill and other intangibles amounted to  and  net of accumulated amortization  respectively 
the impairment test required upon our adoption of sfas and annual impairment review were completed in january and july  respectively  and did not identify any impairment 
we plan to perform an annual impairment review during the fourth quarter of each year or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
we expect to amortize approximately    and  of other intangibles in fiscal   and  respectively  based on our acquisitions completed as of july  to the extent we do not generate sufficient cash flows to recover the net amount of our investment in goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets recorded  the investment could be considered impaired and subject to earlier write off 
restructuring accruals 
in recent years  we implemented several cost reduction plans as part of our continued effort to streamline our operations to reduce ongoing operating expenses 
these plans resulted in restructuring charges related to  among others  the consolidation of excess facilities 
these charges relate to facilities and portions of facilities we no longer utilize and either seek to terminate early or sublease 
lease termination costs for 
table of contents the abandoned facilities were estimated for the remaining lease obligations and brokerage fees offset by estimated sublease income 
estimates related to sublease costs and income are based on assumptions regarding the period required to locate and contract with suitable sub lessees and sublease rates which can be achieved using market trend information analyses provided by a commercial real estate brokerage retained by us 
each reporting period we review these estimates and to the extent that these assumptions change due to continued negotiations with landlords or changes in the market  the ultimate restructuring expenses for these abandoned facilities could vary by material amounts 
loss contingencies 
we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business 
we consider the likelihood of the incurrence of a liability as well as our ability to estimate reasonably the amount of loss in determining loss contingencies 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
sfas no 
requires that we record an estimated loss from a loss contingency when information available prior to the issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred on the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for contingencies such as legal matters requires us to use our judgment 
while we believe that our accruals for such matters are adequate  if the actual loss from a loss contingency is significantly different than the estimated loss  our results of operations may be overstated or understated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted 
provision for doubtful accounts 
our provision for doubtful accounts relates to customer accounts receivable 
the provision for doubtful accounts is an estimate prepared by management based on identification of the collectibility of specific accounts and the overall condition of the receivable portfolios 
we specifically analyze customer receivables  as well as analyze the aging of our accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer credits  customer concentrations  the financial condition of the customers and their credit worthiness  changes in payment terms  current economic trends  our historical write off experience and other assumptions  when evaluating the adequacy of the provision for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
likewise  should we determine that we would be able to realize more of our receivables in the future than previously estimated  an adjustment to the allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
the provision for doubtful accounts is reviewed on a quarterly basis and adjustments are recorded as deemed necessary 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth items included in the consolidated statements of operations part iv of this annual report on form k as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated

we derive revenue from two primary sources software licenses and fees for service 
total revenue was  in fiscal as compared with  in fiscal and  in fiscal revenue increased in fiscal as compared with fiscal and decreased in fiscal as compared with fiscal the revenue growth in fiscal was led by a or approximately  increase in revenue from professional services 
this increase in revenue from professional services represents approximately of our service revenue 
although total license revenue remained flat for fiscal at  our license run rate has been on its quarterly growth path since the first quarter of fiscal license revenue was  for the fourth quarter of fiscal  compared with  for the corresponding period in fiscal 
the decrease in revenue in fiscal resulted mainly from the general economic slowdown and its impact on our customers  many of whom reduced their information technology it spending or ceased their investment in products  services and technologies such as those we provide 
the decline 
table of contents in our revenue for fiscal also resulted from a general slowdown in sales of palm os based handhelds and other personal digital assistants pda devices  as well as delays in our new product introductions 
according to the industry research and advisory firm gartner  inc  worldwide pda shipments declined nine percent in calendar year this decline in pda sales had a direct impact on sales of our intellisync products through the retail and online channels  where sales of our synchronization software typically occur at the same time a pda is purchased  or shortly thereafter 
we believe  however  that demand for pda functionality has not decreased  but the type of mobile device customers want is changing 
therefore  while sales of traditional pda devices may remain challenging for the rest of and  we believe that sales of smartphones and other such wireless devices will continue to grow and have a positive impact on our future revenue 
furthermore  our acquisition of starfish software  inc and asset purchase of loudfire  inc in fiscal  as well as our recent asset purchase of spontaneous technology  inc and licensing agreement with synchrologic to market and sell synchrologic s mobile suite platform  are expected to provide us with access to new technology capabilities  potential access to new markets and customers and other revenue generation opportunities 
we expect revenue benefits over time through resulting synergies in technology  product development and operations 
starfish made positive contributions to revenue in the last two quarters of fiscal totaling  and we believe that new and existing products based upon the technologies from starfish  loudfire  spontaneous technology  and synchrologic will have a positive impact on revenues in fiscal license revenue 
license revenue is earned from the sale and use of software products including our technology licensing components and royalty agreements with oems 
license revenue in fiscal remained flat at  as compared with  in fiscal as the revenue increase from our enterprise and retail products and technology licensing components of approximately  offset the decrease in our revenue from legacy personal computers or notebooks business intellisync for notebooks royalty revenue 
our revenue from technology licensing  excluding revenue from the notebook business  has grown since the first quarter of fiscal  resulting in a fourth quarter revenue of  which exceeded all corresponding quarterly revenue during fiscal license revenue in fiscal decreased to  compared with  in fiscal due to a decrease in revenue from the notebooks business and from the online service offerings eliminated in the fourth quarter of fiscal  as well as the effect of the slowdown in sales of handhelds and pdas 
notebook revenue decreased to an insignificant amount in fiscal as we deemphasized the resources and efforts associated with this revenue segment 
accordingly  we expect that the amount of our legacy notebook business revenue in subsequent quarters will remain insignificant 
service revenue 
service revenue is derived from fees for services  including fixed price and time and materials professional services arrangements  amortization of maintenance contract programs  and  in the prior years  hosting fees 
service revenue was  in fiscal as compared with  in fiscal and  in fiscal the increase in service revenue in fiscal resulted from an increase in professional service revenue associated with our technology licensing partners of approximately  as well as an increase in amortization of our maintenance contract programs of  triggered by our increased effort to renew maintenance agreements within the existing customer base 
slightly over of the increase in our service revenue was contributed by starfish 
the decrease in service revenue in fiscal was due to a decrease in professional service revenue associated with our technology licensing partners  many of whom were affected by a weak it spending environment 
our enterprise and retail products revenue include sales to channel  retail and direct sales of our personal and server products licensed to corporations for internal use 
enterprise and retail products include intellisync  enterprise intellisync  enterprise intellisync server and satellite forms software  as well as related support and maintenance 
total enterprise and retail product revenue was  in fiscal as compared with  in fiscal and  in fiscal the growth in enterprise and retail products 
table of contents revenue in fiscal resulted from an increase in revenue from amortization of support and maintenance  as well as the increase in revenue brought about by the new version of our intellisync software and new enterprise intellisync server launched during the year 
the decrease in enterprise and retail products revenue in fiscal resulted from the general economic slowdown and its unfavorable effect on our customers it spending and on sales of handhelds and pdas 
technology licensing components include various licensed technology platforms  including intellisync software development kit intellisync sdk  pumatech s application data synchronization platform  professional services  non recurring engineering services  related maintenance contract programs  the phasing out intellisync for notebooks  and  in the prior year  hosting services 
total technology licensing revenue was  in fiscal as compared with  in fiscal and  in fiscal the increase in technology licensing revenue resulted from an increase in professional service of approximately  and intellisync sdk revenue of approximately  offset by a decrease in revenue from intellisync for notebooks royalties and the eliminated online hosting service offerings 
the decrease in technology licensing revenue in fiscal resulted from the general economic slowdown bringing down revenue across the board 
international revenue continues to represent a significant portion of our revenue 
international revenue in fiscal was  or of total revenue  as compared with  or of total revenue  in fiscal and  or of total revenue in fiscal the increase in our international annual revenues from fiscal to fiscal accounted for of our total annual revenue increase for fiscal the increase in our professional services revenue and the number of our international technology licensing partners  particularly in japan  resulted in an increase in our international revenue in fiscal for fiscal  the revenue gains in europe and certain parts of asia  which resulted directly from our international direct sales force expansion in fiscal  were more than offset by a decrease in revenue in japan resulting from a general economic slowdown and an overall reduction in technology spending in that country 
the increase as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal  however  was due to a greater decline in our overall revenue 
we believe our international revenue will fluctuate on a quarter to quarter basis as we periodically enter into new agreements for professional services and new international partner contracts for technology licensing 
international revenue may be subject to certain risks not normally encountered in operations in the united states  including exposure to tariffs  various trade regulations  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  as well as international software piracy 
we believe that continued growth would require further expansion in international markets 
we have utilized  and may continue to utilize substantial resources both to expand and establish international operations in the future 
one distributor  ingram micro us  accounted for  and of our total revenue during fiscal  and  respectively 
no other distributors or resellers accounted for more than of total revenue during these periods 
in accordance with our revenue recognition policy  the revenue from our major distributors  such as ingram micro us  represents revenue recognized at the time our products were sold to end user customers 
no end user customers  direct or through distributors and resellers  accounted for more than of total revenue during the same periods 
deferred revenue results from the billing of fees from our customers for the purchase of license agreements and maintenance services for which we have not yet recognized revenue 
we recognize the respective revenue after meeting the terms and conditions detailed in our revenue recognition policy 
deferred revenue was  and  at july  and  respectively 
deferred revenue decreased due to the recognition of revenue from several of our license agreements and professional services that had been deferred in previous periods 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue consists of license costs and service costs 
license costs comprise product packaging expenses such as product media and duplication  manuals  packing supplies  and shipping costs 
service costs comprise personnel related expenses such as salaries and other related costs associated with 
table of contents work performed under professional service contracts  non recurring engineering agreements  post sales customer support costs and  in the prior year  hosting costs for online services associated with technology licensing partners and end users 
hosting costs include expenses related to bandwidth for hosting  tape backup  security and storage  third party fees and internal personnel costs associated with logistics and operational support of the hosting services and depreciation of computer equipment associated with the hosting service 
service costs can be expected to vary significantly from period to period depending on the mix of services we provide 
in general  license revenue costs represent a smaller percentage of license revenue when compared with service revenue costs as a percentage of service revenue  this is due to the high cost structure of service revenue 
additionally  license costs tend to be variable based on license revenue volumes  whereas service costs tend to be fixed within certain service revenue volume ranges 
we would expect that an increase in service revenue as a percentage of our total revenue would generate lower overall gross margins as a percentage of total revenue 
also  given the high level of fixed costs associated with the professional services group  our inability to generate revenue sufficient to absorb these fixed costs could lead to negative service gross margins 
cost of license revenue 
cost of license revenue moderately increased to  or of license revenue in fiscal from  or of license revenue in fiscal cost of license revenue was  or of license revenue in fiscal the increase in cost of license revenue in absolute dollars in fiscal resulted from the increase in overall revenue from enterprise and retail products 
the decrease in cost of license revenue in absolute dollars in fiscal resulted from reduced variable packaged product costs associated with reduced license volumes 
cost of service revenue 
cost of service revenue was  or of service revenue   or of service revenue   or of service revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in cost of revenue in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue for fiscal reflected cost savings in professional services resulting from contracting certain software development activities to lower cost international development partners  as well as from the effect of workforce reductions we implemented in fiscal to our personnel related costs  more particularly at the beginning of the fiscal year 
the decrease was also partly due to reduced online service costs associated with the online service offerings discontinued in fiscal the decrease in cost of service revenue for fiscal was offset by the  noncash variable accounting charge associated with certain outstanding stock options as a result of an increase in our stock price 
the decrease in cost of revenue in absolute dollars in fiscal was primarily due to a decrease in professional services costs as a result of workforce reductions we implemented in fiscal  as well as overall reduction in our service revenues 
navisite legal contingency 
during fiscal  navisite  inc  a company that formerly provided certain web site hosting and related services to us  alleged that we improperly terminated a service agreement with and were thereby indebted to navisite 
we reached a settlement with navisite and paid a total of  inclusive of fees for the services previously provided  during fiscal the total amount of the settlement was not significantly different from the established loss contingency reserve 
we expect our total cost of revenue in the next quarter to increase slightly relative to that of the fourth quarter of fiscal due in part to the impact of our recent significant acquisitions 
in addition  our cost of revenue is primarily driven by our expectation for different margin characteristics within and between license and service revenues as well as the expected mix between products and channels 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for research and development personnel  quality assurance personnel  product localization  fees to outside contractors and the cost of facilities and depreciation of capital equipment 
we invest in research and development both for new products and to provide continuing enhancements to existing products 
our engineering group is currently aiming their efforts at expanding focus from cabled synchronization to synchronization for wireless handhelds  smartphones  laptops and tablets  at extending our core synchronization 
table of contents technology to increase scalability and extensibility  and at supporting next generation wireless technology and device platforms 
research and development expenses decreased by to  in fiscal from  in fiscal in fiscal  research and development expenses decreased by to  from  in fiscal research and development represented  and of total revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in research and development spending in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in fiscal was due to realization of benefits  particularly at the first part of fiscal  from the workforce reduction and consolidation of engineering facilities  as well as elimination of online service operations  implemented in the last two quarters of fiscal our engineering workforce was reduced by employees during fiscal the benefits  in turn  resulted in a decrease in personnel related costs and other costs 
the decrease was also due to savings in overall engineering costs resulting from contracting engineering activities to lower cost international development partners 
the decrease in absolute research and development spending in fiscal was primarily due to the elimination of the intellisync 
com sm online service and our re emphasis on core product development  as part of the cost control initiatives we implemented in fiscal and  which resulted in a decrease in personnel and contractor related costs 
this decrease was slightly offset by a write off of certain excess software development tools and completion bonuses paid to certain employees affected by restructuring in fiscal as a percentage of total revenue  research and development expenses increased in fiscal due to overall revenue decline in fiscal research and development expenses are expected to increase for the next quarter as a result of an increase in our engineering workforce resulting from the acquisition of spontaneous technology 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  promotional expenses and other costs relating to sales and marketing employees  as well as to technical support personnel associated with pre sales activities such as building brand awareness  performing product and technical presentations and answering customers product and service inquiries 
sales and marketing expenses decreased by to  in fiscal from  in fiscal in fiscal  sales and marketing expenses decreased by to  in fiscal from  in fiscal sales and marketing expenses represented  and of total revenues in fiscal   and  respectively 
sales and marketing expenses decreased in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue in fiscal due to a  reduction in corporate marketing resources  corporate branding initiatives and other related costs as a result of lower planned spending 
personnel related costs also decreased by  as a result of headcount reductions in the last two quarters of fiscal the decrease in personnel related costs was offset by a  increase in bonus and commission as a result of an increase in overall revenue 
sales and marketing expenses decreased in absolute terms in fiscal due to reduction in salaries and other personnel related costs of  as a result of headcount reductions  reduction in bonus and commissions of  effected by a lower revenue  and a decrease in other costs of  due to lower planned spending 
sales and marketing expenses  however  increased as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal due to overall revenue decline for the year 
as compared with the sales and marketing costs in the fourth quarter of fiscal  sales and marketing expenses for the next quarter are expected to remain relatively flat 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other costs relating to administrative  executive and financial personnel and outside professional fees 
general and administrative expenses increased by to  in fiscal from  in fiscal in fiscal  general and administrative expenses decreased by to  from  in fiscal general and administrative expenses represented approximately  and of total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
the major factors for the increase in general and administrative spending in fiscal include an increase in our stock price that resulted in a significant increase of  in noncash variable accounting charge for fiscal associated with certain outstanding stock options and an increase of  in outside services brought about primarily by legal costs associated with our ongoing patent infringement lawsuits 
the increase was offset by a decrease of  in personnel related costs  the absence of  special charge incurred in fiscal  a substantial reduction in our past due accounts receivable balances effecting a favorable decrease of  on our bad debt expense provisions for the year and a decrease in other costs of  as a result of lower planned spending 
the decrease in absolute general and 
table of contents administrative spending in fiscal was primarily due to a reduction in provision for bad debts allowance of  and a reduction in personnel related costs of  as a result of restructurings 
this decrease was slightly offset by a provision recorded for rent reimbursement deemed uncollectible of  relating to the windward group acquisition  as well as a signing bonus of  for our new president and chief executive officer 
general and administrative expenses  however  increased as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal due to overall decline in revenue 
we expect our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue for the first quarter of fiscal to remain at a similar level to that of the fourth quarter of fiscal  subject to the timing of spending on the ongoing litigation which can be difficult to forecast 
in addition  depending on the degree of the fluctuation of our stock price in the future  we may incur a significant noncash variable accounting charge or a recovery of charges from prior quarters 
the charge or the recovery may increase or decrease our total general and administrative costs in the next few quarters 
the charge or the recovery may also further increase or offset our expected total cost of revenue  research and development and sales and marketing costs in the near future 
in process research and development 
in the third quarter of fiscal we recorded a charge of  for in process research and development associated with the acquisition of starfish 
the purchase price of starfish was assigned to the fair value of the assets acquired  including the in process research and development 
as of the acquisition date  technological feasibility of the in process technology had not been established and the technology had no alternative future use 
accordingly  we expensed the in process research and development at the date of the acquisition 
the amount of the purchase price allocated to in process research and technology was based on established valuation techniques used in high technology computer software industry 
the fair value assigned to the acquired in process research and development was determined using the income approach  which discounts expected future cash flows to present value 
the key assumptions used in the valuation include  among others  expected completion date of the in process projects identified as of the acquisition date  estimated costs to complete the projects  revenue contributions and expense projections assuming the resulting product have entered the market  and discount rate based on the risks associated with the development life cycle of the in process technology acquired 
the discount rate used in the present value calculations are normally obtained from a weighted average cost of capital analysis  adjusted upward to account for the inherent uncertainties surrounding the successful development of the in process research and development  the expected profitability levels of such technology  and the uncertainty of technological advances that could potentially impact the estimates 
we assume the pricing model for the resulting product of the acquired in process research and technology to be standard within our industry 
we  however  did not take into consideration any consequential amount of expense reductions from integrating the acquired in process technology with our other existing in process or completed technology 
therefore  the valuation assumptions do not include significant anticipated cost savings 
the key assumptions  we believe to be reasonable  underlying the valuation of acquired in process research and development from starfish are as follows in thousands project name mercury platform technology percent completed as of acquisition date estimated costs to complete technology at acquisition date  risk adjusted discount rate first period expected revenue calendar year the development of these technologies remains highly dependent on the remaining efforts to achieve technical viability  rapidly changing customer markets  uncertain standards for new products  and significant competitive threats from several companies 
the nature of the efforts to develop these technologies into commercially viable products consists primarily of planning  designing  experimenting  and testing activities necessary to determine that the technologies can meet market expectations  including functionality and technical 
table of contents requirements 
failure to bring these products to market in a timely manner could result in a loss of market share or a lost opportunity to capitalize on emerging markets  and could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 
subsequent to the acquisition of starfish  there have been no significant developments related to the current status of the acquired in process research and development project that would result in material changes to the assumptions 
if the starfish project is not successfully developed  our future revenues and profitability may be adversely affected 
failure to achieve the expected levels of revenue and net income from these products will negatively impact the return on investment expected at the time that the acquisitions were completed and may result in impairment charges 
additionally  the value of other intangible assets acquired may become impaired 
amortization of goodwill 
sfas no 
established new guidance on how to account for goodwill and intangible assets after a business combination is completed 
among other things  it requires that goodwill and certain other intangible assets no longer be amortized and be tested for impairment at least annually and written down only when impaired 
we perform the annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each year 
we measure the impairment of goodwill and certain other intangible assets primarily using the present value of expected future cash flows 
we adopted sfas no 
effective august  accordingly  upon adoption of the new standard  we ceased to amortize our existing goodwill 
we also completed the impairment test required and annual impairment review in january and july  respectively  and did not identify any impairment 
total net book value of goodwill at july  and  was  total amortization of goodwill amounted to zero   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in amortization of goodwill in fiscal reflects the effect of the impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which significantly reduced the carrying value of our then existing goodwill 
amortization of other intangibles 
other intangible assets  excluding that of acquired workforce in place  amount to  and  net of accumulated amortization  as of july  and  respectively 
the net book value of other intangible assets at july  is reflective of approximately  of the amortizable  identifiable intangibles obtained from the acquisition of starfish and the asset purchase of loudfire in fiscal we continue to amortize other intangible assets  review such assets for impairment under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  reassess their useful lives and make any necessary adjustments 
amortization is computed over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets  generally nine months to four years 
the amortization of other intangible assets amounted to   and  for fiscal  and  respectively 
of the total amortization of other intangible assets    and  relate to developed technology for fiscal  and  respectively 
the fully amortized intangibles effected the decrease  net of the effect of those newly acquired  in the amortization of other intangible assets in fiscal the decrease in amortization of other intangible assets in fiscal reflects the effect of the impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which significantly reduced the carrying value of our then existing other intangible assets 
we expect total amortization expense  exclusive of the probable effect of the recent spontaneous technology acquisition  to be as follows in thousands fiscal year ending july  
table of contents restructuring and other charges 
restructuring and other charges consist of the following year ended july  restructuring charges severance costs facilities costs assets held for disposal other charges restructuring charges other charges separation costs costs relating to a ceased acquisition other charges restructuring and other charges restructuring charges during fiscal  and  we implemented a number of cost reduction plans aimed at reducing costs that were not integral to our overall strategy  better aligning our expense levels with current revenue levels and ensuring conservative spending during periods of economic uncertainty 
these initiatives included a reduction in workforce and facilities consolidation 
of the resulting restructuring charge and subsequent adjustments  if any  approximately  remained unpaid as of july  this amount  related to the net lease expense due to the consolidation of excess facilities  will be paid over the respective lease terms through may using cash from operations 
in fiscal  we incurred approximately  for severance and separation costs relating to recent termination of of our engineering and product management employees 
we also incurred a charge of approximately  for a revised estimated lease exit cost due to additional time required to sublease the facilities 
this revision was attributable to the high vacancy rates in the corporate real estate market in northern california 
the following table sets forth the activity in the restructuring accrual account in thousands workforce reduction consolidation of excess facilities other total balance at july  restructuring provision non cash charges cash payments balance at july  restructuring provision adjustment non cash charges cash payments balance at july  restructuring provision adjustment cash payments balance at july  
table of contents the current and long term portions of the underlying accrual of  and  are classified as accrued liabilities and other liabilities  respectively  in the consolidated balance sheet as of july  we continually evaluate the balance of the restructuring reserve we record in prior periods based on the remaining estimated amounts to be paid 
differences  if any  between the estimated amounts accrued and the actual amounts paid will be reflected in operating expenses in future periods 
we believe that the above restructurings have contributed towards the improvement in our operating income during fiscal we expect the savings  particularly in facilities related costs  brought about by these restructurings to continue for fiscal future savings are anticipated to include approximately  primarily in operating expenses  each year for the next few years from our fiscal workforce reduction and   and  in fiscal  and  respectively  in facility related expenditures 
separation costs in fiscal  we recorded accruals of approximately  related to separation agreements with our former president and chief executive officer and former executive vice president of sales and business development 
no amount remained unpaid as of july  costs relating to ceased acquisition we incurred a charge of approximately  for operating expenses  mainly legal and accounting  relating to an acquisition that we subsequently ceased pursuing 
impairment of assets 
impairment of assets consists of the following in thousands year ended july  intangibles commitment assets held and used assets held for disposal impairment of assets during fiscal and  we determined that certain intangible assets we acquired  certain assets used exclusively for our online operations and intellisync 
com were impaired 
therefore  we recorded impairment charges of  and  in fiscal and  respectively  to write down or write off goodwill and certain intangibles in connection with the proxinet  dry creek software  windward and swifttouch acquisitions  and other assets  as well as a related commitment  we believe will not bring a viable business opportunity for us in the future 
proxinet we purchased proxinet in the first quarter of fiscal in anticipation of broadening the appeal of internet connected wireless devices and other internet appliances through the use of proxinet s core technology  proxiware and proxiweb  later branded as the browse it product 
by combining pumatech s intellisync platform with this highly scalable proxy based transformation and delivery architecture  major internet destinations such as portals  search engines and e commerce companies would have the means to provide highly secure  real time access to users of handheld devices  cellular phones and other devices and internet appliances 
we expected that users would be able to browse information online  while simultaneously retrieving and synchronizing critical information while offline 
at the time the proxinet s acquisition was consummated  we planned to market browse it primarily to major internet companies such as portals and e commerce sites as well as cellular carriers and other wireless providers 
browse it started generating revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal  but at a level 
table of contents substantially lower than what we originally expected average quarterly revenue for fiscal was approximately  in addition  due to general economic slowdowns  several of our browse it customers  many of which are internet companies  reduced their it spending or ceased their investment in products  services and technologies such as those we provide 
consequently  revenue from browse it continued to deteriorate  decreasing as low as  by the fourth quarter of fiscal these factors demonstrated that browse it product would not bring sufficient revenue to absorb high related costs 
by the end of fiscal  as part of our plan to refocus our business strategies  we decided to discontinue our browse it technology offerings 
related employees were either terminated or reassigned to other engineering functions 
furthermore  we determined that browse it technology has no alternative uses and had not been incorporated into other products or services  and  accordingly  recorded in fiscal an impairment write off of  and  related to the net book value of goodwill and developed and core technology  respectively  from the proxinet acquisition 
dry creek and windward we purchased dry creek and windward in the fourth quarter of fiscal and first quarter of fiscal  respectively  in anticipation of several benefits from the acquisitions  including dry creek would serve as the core of our professional services offerings  windward would expand the professional services group and become a turnkey vendor providing top tier customers with customized solutions substantially based on our technology licensing components  the acquisitions would enable us to accelerate deployment of our technology licensing components with existing and targeted customers  the acquisition would provide us with a pool of talented and highly skilled employees  approximately employees were hired from both acquisitions  dry creek s developed and core technology 
at the time the acquisitions were completed  we had experienced sequential growth in quarterly revenue from our technology licensing components 
from  for the first quarter of fiscal  our technology license revenue increased for the same period in fiscal by to  from the first quarter of fiscal to the first quarter of fiscal  cost of revenue was in the range of to of total revenue 
at the time the acquisitions were consummated  we anticipated continued growth and increased gross margin contribution due to increased capacity acquired from our increased professional services workforce 
however  the general economic slowdown in calendar year and in caused a number of our existing and potential customers to reduce their it spending or cease their investment in products  services and technologies such as those we provide 
additionally  many of our technology licensing customers closed their operations or were unable to meet their contractual obligations leaving us with a smaller installed base of customers across which to deploy our professional service team 
because of these and other factors  our technology licensing revenue decreased during the second quarter of fiscal to  remained relatively flat in the third quarter at  and decreased during the fourth quarter to  compared with technology licensing revenue in the first quarter 
revenue from our professional services  which facilitate our technology licensing components  for the same periods was   and  respectively  which was significantly lower than our expectations 
in addition  cost of revenue for those periods of  and  respectively  of total revenue were significantly higher than those in recent previous quarters given the high level of related fixed costs  in particular personnel related costs  and revenues insufficient to absorb these costs 
to better align our expense levels with current revenue levels and ensure conservative spending  we implemented cost reduction plans in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal the first plan  as well as employees transfers and resignations  decreased the number of employees in the professional services 
table of contents group to by the end of the third quarter of fiscal the second plan resulted in a further reduction in our workforce bringing down the number of employees in the professional services group to by july  the aforementioned factors led us to believe that the goodwill and intangibles acquired from dry creek and windward were impaired 
accordingly  we assessed the recoverability of the related long lived assets and  as a result  recorded an impairment write down of goodwill of  in fiscal the impairment was measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of goodwill and purchased intangibles exceeded the present value of the estimated future cash flows from the professional services group 
the assumptions supporting the future cash flows  including the discount rate of  were determined using our best estimates 
the discount rate was determined based upon the weighted average cost of capital of comparable companies 
we continue to monitor the operations of our professional services group  its trend of revenue growth or decline  all associated costs  and its overall contribution to our profitability  as well as any events or indicators that the carrying amount of the remaining goodwill and intangibles might not be recoverable 
swifttouch we purchased certain technology assets from swifttouch in the second quarter of fiscal in anticipation of increasing our revenue and accelerating our return to profitability through the use of swifttouch developed technology for our intellisync 
com online service offering 
we believed this technology would extend the capabilities of our intellisync 
com service bureau by providing potential subscribers with access to various information via wap wireless application protocol enabled phones or by voice 
it would deliver powerful collaborative features that automatically update calendar and contact information among groups of users  while also giving us a viral marketing tool for minimizing user acquisition costs as we attempted to build the intellisync 
com subscriber base 
at the time the swifttouch acquisition was consummated  we planned to host our technology licensing components for the public through our intellisync 
com web service within the first half of calendar year in march  we introduced intellisync 
com to the public and offered its available service options free of charge during the initial introductory period 
we anticipated that several thousands users would adopt intellisync 
com and that we would derive a significant portion of our future revenue from offering fee based services beginning in the spring of by the end of the first half of calendar year  we realized that successful customer adoption of and monetization from several fee based online service offerings such as our intellisync 
com offerings were slow and limited 
additionally  deployment and usage of mobile wireless devices had fallen short of our expectations 
these factors  as well as changes in general economic and market conditions  led us to believe that if intellisync 
com were to continue  the costs associated with its operation would have a further negative impact on our results of operations 
by the end of fiscal  as a result of the events described above  we decided that intellisync 
com should be suspended indefinitely and determined that technology acquired from swifttouch used exclusively for intellisync 
com was impaired 
accordingly  an impairment write down of  related to the net book value of goodwill and identifiable intangibles from the swifttouch acquisition was recorded in fiscal other impaired assets the recent plan to focus effort on our core business necessitated a thorough review of certain operations and related assets that we believe will not be viable to integrate into our new strategies 
our new plan provided for no further support for online operations  as well as terminating the use and maintenance of excess related assets 
during fiscal  in our review of our online operations and related assets  such as computers  servers  network and other hosting related equipment  we specifically identified those assets that would be held for use to finish preexisting contracts with certain customers for a short period of time  after which the 
table of contents assets will be disposed of or abandoned 
we also identified the related assets that would be held for immediate disposal 
based on a recoverability analysis we performed of the assets carrying value  we have anticipated no further cash flows from the online operations 
we  therefore  recorded an impairment charge of  and  for assets held for use and assets held for disposal  respectively  based on the amount by which the carrying amount of assets exceeded the recovery value less disposal costs 
we determined the recovery value of the assets using our best estimates on market prices of similar assets 
in addition  we have written off related hosting commitment with a third party vendor  a related party  for its entire value  totaling  with respect to the indefinite suspension of intellisync 
com described above  we identified certain assets related to intellisync 
com that we would no longer use 
we  therefore  classified these assets as held for disposal and revised their carrying value from book value to recovery value less disposal costs resulting in a  impairment charge in fiscal other income expense 
other income expense  net  represents interest earned on cash and short term investments and realized gains on miscellaneous investments  offset by interest expense on debt  miscellaneous bank fees and charges  as well as other than temporary impairment of investments 
total net other expense for fiscal was  as compared with total net other income of  in fiscal and  in fiscal the total net other expense in fiscal included an other than temporary impairment charge of  as discussed further below  relating to the disposal of our limited partnership interest in a venture capital fund  slightly offset by a net interest and other income of  for the year 
the total net other income in fiscal resulted from a net interest and other income of  slightly offset by an other than temporary impairment charge of  relating to our pro rata share of net loss realized by the venture capital fund on sale or liquidation of certain investments and net other expense of  the total net other income in fiscal resulted from a net interest and other income of  slightly offset by an other than temporary impairment charge of  on investments deemed unrecoverable  as discussed further below  and net other expense of  net interest and other income decreased in fiscal and due to lower rate of interest on reduced balances of cash and investments 
we expect other income  net  over the first quarter of fiscal to decrease slightly as compared with that of the recent previous quarters due to further reduction in cash and investments 
other than temporary impairment of investments 
during fiscal  we marketed our investment for disposal of our limited partnership interest in azure venture partners  llp  a venture capital fund 
the disposal of the interest allowed us to avoid commitments for further investments in equity instruments of various privately held companies made through azure  many of which had not generated adequate returns 
in addition  the disposal was in line with our strategy of focusing resources and efforts more on our core operations 
consequently  we recorded an other than temporary impairment charge of  total proceeds of  from the sale of the interest were received in may  which approximated the carrying value of the investment after the writedown 
during fiscal  we recorded a charge for an other than temporary impairment of investments of approximately  related to our pro rata share of net loss realized by a venture capital fund on sale or liquidation of certain investments 
during fiscal  we recorded impairment charges aggregating  for our direct investments in yadayada  inc  if then  inc  and pulsemd corporation that we deemed unrecoverable 
these investments were fully impaired due to changes in these entities capital structure impacting our investment preferences  thin capitalization  dilution due to dramatic declines in valuations and overall lack of persuasive evidence that would indicate a future ability or intent of these entities that would support the carrying value of our investments 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes primarily represents foreign withholding taxes on royalties earned from certain foreign customers and  to a lesser extent  state franchise and income taxes and estimated taxes for foreign subsidiaries 
provision for income taxes was   and  in 
table of contents fiscal  and  respectively 
we expect the provision for income taxes to increase moderately in the next quarter reflecting an expected slight growth in revenue from japan and the related foreign tax withholdings

we anticipate completion of the transaction by the end of the calendar year a licensing agreement signed by both companies enables us to market and sell synchrologic s mobile suite platform immediately as our server based synchronization solution for enterprise customers 
should the acquisition fail to occur  the licensing will continue through the end of the three year term of the agreement 
for the next few quarters  we expect the starfish acquisition and the asset purchase of loudfire and spontaneous technology  as well as the new licensing agreement with synchrologic  to bring modest improvement in our cash flows from operating activities with the realization of synergistic benefits and revenue opportunities 
effects of inflation we believe that our financial results have not been significantly impacted by inflation and price changes during fiscal  and related party transactions our former chief financial officer terminated his employment with pumatech as of september  consequently  in accordance with the officer s outstanding loan agreement  his unpaid loan principal of  and related interest of per annum  become repayable on the th day from his termination date  or on the due date of the loan  whichever is sooner 
the repayment of the loan principal and accrued interest accordingly became due on march  the loan principal  including accrued interest  was paid in april 
table of contents we have a full recourse loan outstanding to an officer with a principal amount of approximately  exclusive of accrued interest  as of july  the loan carries an interest rate of per annum and is payable on june  the due date may be accelerated due to a number of factors including  failure to make payments due under the note or termination of employment 
the note is secured by shares of the common stock purchased 
restricted cash and lines of credit we have restricted cash held by two financial institutions as collateral on letters of credit in connection with our lease of office spaces 
refer to the caption guarantees below for further details 
we had a loan and security agreement that provided us a  revolving credit line 
the outstanding balance of  at july  was fully paid using cash from our working capital on the date of the agreement s expiration in september the line of credit was not renewed 
commitments the following table sets forth future payments  for which we anticipate using cash from operations  due under our lease obligations as of july  in thousands operating leases proceeds from subleases future minimum lease payments fiscal year ending july  see acquisitions above for a definitive agreement to acquire synchrologic  inc guarantees at july  and  we had two letters of credit that collateralize certain operating lease obligations and total approximately  we collateralize these letters of credit with cash deposits made with some of our financial institutions and have classified the short term and the long term portions as other current assets and restricted cash  respectively  in the consolidated balance sheets set forth in part iv  item  of this annual report on form k 
our landlords are able to draw on each respective letter of credit in the event that we are found to be in default of our obligations under each of our operating leases 
warranties we generally provide a warranty for our software products and services to our customers for a period of days 
our software products media are generally warrantied to be free of defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and the products are also generally warrantied to perform substantially as described in certain company documentation 
our services are generally warrantied to be performed in a professional manner and to conform materially to the specifications set forth in a customer s signed contract 
in the event there is a failure of such warranties  we generally correct or provide a reasonable work around or replacement product 
we believe such obligations do not significantly affect our financial position or results of operations 
we accrue for warranty expenses at the time revenue is recognized and maintain a warranty accrual for the estimated future warranty obligation based upon the relationship between historical and anticipated costs 
in 
table of contents other instances  additional amounts are recorded when such costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated 
the warranty accrual is reviewed at least quarterly 
as of july   the warranty accrual was  which approximates the balance as of july  indemnification obligations on certain occasions  we provide to our customers intellectual property indemnification  subject to certain limitations  in our arrangements for our software products or services 
typically these obligations provide that we will indemnify  defend and hold the customers harmless against claims by third parties that our software products or services infringe upon the copyrights  trademarks  patents or trade secret rights of such third parties 
as of july   no such claim has been made by any third party with regard to our software products or services 
the liability reserve for indemnification obligations is not significant 
section of the delaware general corporation law delaware law permits the indemnification of officers  directors  and other corporate agents under certain circumstances and subject to certain limitations 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that we shall indemnify our directors  officers  employees  and agents to the full extent permitted by delaware law  including in circumstances in which indemnification is otherwise discretionary under delaware law 
in addition  we have entered into separate indemnification agreements with our directors and officers which would require us  among other things  to indemnify them against certain liabilities which may arise by reason of their status or service other than liabilities arising from willful misconduct of a culpable nature 
these indemnification provisions may be sufficiently broad to permit indemnification of our officers and directors for liabilities including reimbursement of expenses incurred arising under the securities act of  as amended 
at present  there is no pending litigation or proceeding involving any of our director  officer  employee or other agent in which indemnification is being sought nor are we aware of any threatened litigation that may result in a claim for indemnification by any of our director  officer  employee or other agent 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances  including cash generated from operations  if any  will be sufficient to meet our working capital and other cash requirements for at least the next months 
we expect total capital expenditures for fiscal to range between  and  principally for phone  computer and other various system upgrades 
from time to time  we may consider additional acquisitions and a wide range of other business opportunities 
some of them may be unrelated to our current business activities and could require additional capital 
in the future  we may require additional capital to fund any new acquisition  business opportunity or venture  as well as to fund future operating requirements 
we may seek to raise cash through the issuance of debt or equity securities 
there can be no assurance that such financing would be available to us at all  or on terms favorable to us 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign currency fluctuations  equity price and market values of our investments  which could impact our results of operations and financial condition 
we currently do not utilize derivative financial instruments to hedge such risks 
interest rate risk at july   we had an investment portfolio of mostly fixed income securities  including those classified as cash equivalents and securities available for sale  of  these securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of july   the decline of the fair value of the portfolio would be immaterial 
we attempt to mitigate risk by holding our fixed income investments until maturity to avoid recognizing an adverse impact in income or cash flows in the event of an increase in market interest rates  but an increase in our liquidity needs may require us to sell fixed rate securities prior to maturity 
the table below presents the carrying value which approximates fair value and related weighted average coupon interest rates for our investment portfolio at july  in thousands  except interest rates 
carrying amount average coupon interest rate cash equivalents securities with maturity due within one year or less due after one year through two years annuities  auction rate preferred stock and other  with no maturity total portfolio foreign currency risk to date  the majority of our recognized revenue  including international revenue  has been denominated in united states dollars  and our exposure to foreign currency exchange rates has been immaterial 
we expect  however  that more product and service revenue may be derived from international markets and may be denominated in the currency of the applicable market in the future 
as a result  our operating results may become subject to significant fluctuations based upon changes in exchange rates of certain currencies in relation to the united states dollar 
we will also be exposed to increased risk of non payment by our customers in foreign countries  especially those of highly inflationary economies 
furthermore  to the extent that we engage in international sales denominated in united states dollars  an increase in the value of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products and services less competitive in international markets 
although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations  and  when appropriate  may use financial hedging techniques in the future to minimize the effect of these fluctuations  we cannot be assured that exchange rate fluctuations will not adversely affect our financial results in the future 
we may continue to expand internationally in the future and become increasingly subject to other risks of doing business internationally including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  and other regulations and restrictions 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 

table of contents we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial statements of a foreign subsidiary are translated into united states dollar in consolidation 
as exchange rates vary  these results  when translated  may vary from expectations and adversely impact overall expected profitability 
to date  the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our financial statements has been immaterial 
other investment risk from time to time we invest in equity instruments of privately held companies for business and strategic purposes 
we regularly review the operating performance of the companies the carrying value of our investments 
during fiscal  for instance  we sold our limited partnership interest in a venture capital fund 
the disposal of the interest allowed us to avoid commitments for further investments in equity instruments of various privately held companies made through the venture capital fund  many of which we believe had not generated adequate returns 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge equal to the loss on sale of the interest in the venture capital fund 
although our investments in equity instruments of privately held companies now amounted to an insignificant amount at july   we may continue to invest in such companies in the future 
we will continue to assess the carrying values of such investments  however we cannot be assured that a decline in their values will not adversely affect our financial results in the future
