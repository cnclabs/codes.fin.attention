item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is based upon and should be read in conjunction with selected financial data  consolidated financial statements  and the notes thereto 
see also forward looking statements above 
overview marine products mission is to maximize the boating experience by providing its customers with high quality  innovative powerboats and related products and services 
marine products  through its wholly owned subsidiaries chaparral and robalo  is a leading manufacturer of recreational fiberglass powerboats 
chaparral competes in the sterndrive engine powered  sportboat  deckboat and cruiser markets 
robalo  acquired in june  competes in the outboard engine powered offshore sport fishing boat market 
robalo sales comprised percent of net sales in critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  trends in the industry  and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
recognition of sales the company sells its boats through its international network of independent dealers 
although sales orders are cancelable at any time  substantially all boats are pre sold to a dealer before entering the production line 
the company recognizes sales when all the following conditions are met a fully executed sales agreement exists  the price of the boat is established  the dealer takes delivery of the boat  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
accrued dealer discounts the company s dealer incentive programs include annual volume based discounts that promote early replenishment of dealer inventories after the spring and summer peak selling seasons and help to level out manufacturing volumes throughout the year 
these discounts are based on the dealer purchase volumes for the period july through june of the following year 
the company monitors dealer purchases and uses its judgment to determine an appropriate dealer discount reserve 
the company records these estimated discounts and other sales incentives as the related sales are recognized 
our future financial results will be impacted by any differences between our estimates and the actual amounts paid to settle these liabilities 
dealer floor plan interest the company provides an option to pay a qualifying dealer s incurred floor plan interest costs on current model year inventory held during specified periods of time 
the ultimate interest costs to be absorbed by the company will vary depending upon the dollar amount and length of time the dealer maintains the inventory as well as variations in interest rates 
at the time the boat sales are recognized  the company records an experience based estimate of the future interest costs to be incurred on boats sold as of the balance sheet date 
while we believe that our floor plan interest reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  such estimated amounts could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future 
our future financial results will be impacted by any differences between our estimates and the actual amounts paid to settle these liabilities 
warranty accruals the company provides warranties against manufacturing defects for various components of the boats  primarily the fiberglass deck and hull 
the warranty periods vary by component  but extend up to ten years 
at the time the boat sales are recognized  the company records an experience based estimate of the future warranty costs to be incurred on boats sold 
while we believe that our warranty reserve is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  such estimated amounts could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future 
our future financial results will be impacted by any differences between our estimates and the actual amounts paid to settle these liabilities 
accrued insurance liabilities the company has exposure to various contingent liabilities and future claims 
the company self insures  up to specified limits  its employee health insurance plan costs 
the cost of claims under this self insurance program is estimated and accrued as the claims are incurred although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods 
these claims are monitored and the cost estimates are revised as developments occur relating to such claims 
to estimate the ultimate cost of the claims  the company uses its experience  and where appropriate  the advice of outside experts 
upon the ultimate resolution of these uncertainties  our future financial results will be impacted by the difference between our estimates and the actual amounts paid to settle the liabilities 
pension liabilities pension costs are actuarially determined and affected by assumptions including the discount rate  the estimated future return on plan assets and other factors 
the company evaluates assumptions used on a periodic basis and makes adjustments to these liabilities as necessary 
the company utilizes the moody s aa long term corporate bond yield as a basis for determining the discount rate with a yield adjustment made for the longer duration of the company s obligations 
the company evaluates its assumption regarding the estimated long term rate of return on plan assets based on historical experience and future expectation on investment returns 
the company chooses a rate of return on plan assets that it believes is an appropriate long term average return 
the expected return on plan assets takes into account estimated future investment returns for various asset classes held in the plans portfolio 
to the extent changes are required in the assumptions discussed above  the company s recorded liabilities may have to be adjusted and may result in a material impact to the results of operations  financial position or liquidity of the company 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
marine products generated net sales of  in compared to  in  an increase of  or percent 
based on available industry statistics  chaparral has continued to gain market share 
the net sales increase in compared to resulted primarily from a percent increase in the volume of boats sold coupled with a four percent increase in the average sales price 
management believes that the increase in unit volume was partially related to the american consumers decision to pursue recreational activities closer to home due to political and economic uncertainty 
the increase in the average sales price resulted from an increase in the number of larger cruisers  sportboats  and deckboats sold during the year in combination with the elimination of our lowest price line of boats  the chaparral sse

liquidity and capital resources the company s decisions about the amount of cash to be used for investing and financing purposes are influenced by our capital position and the expected amount of cash to be provided by operations 
as the result of being spun off in february  the company became a separate publicly traded company 
the company s operations historically have generated sufficient cash for its operations and the excess was transferred to rpc 
in connection with the spin off from rpc  the company received  in cash and marketable securities from rpc 
the company is now able to retain any excess cash it generates  however  in the event capital is needed to fund operations  capital expenditures or acquisitions  it is no longer able to rely upon the capital resources of rpc 
cash provided by operations during was  an increase of  compared to the increase was due to higher operating income in compared to offset by higher working capital requirements at december  because of higher sales and manufacturing activities 
cash used for investing activities decreased  to  in the company had lower capital expenditures in compared to and the prior year included the cost of the robalo acquisition 
during  the company completed construction of  square feet of new manufacturing space to accommodate the building of signature cruisers up to feet in length 
during  the company acquired a manufacturing facility for the new robalo product line 
cash used in financing activities included cash dividend payments to marine products common stockholders for four quarters of and after the spin off for three quarters of consistent with customary industry practices  the company has agreements with third party dealer floor plan lenders to repurchase any of it boats that are repossessed by the lender 
the company maintains a reserve for estimated losses on boats repurchased 
the company s obligation under its guarantee becomes effective in the case of default in payments by the dealer 
the agreements provide for the return of all repossessed boats to the company in exchange for the company s assumption of specified percentages of the dealers unpaid debt obligation on those boats based on the original dealer purchase date 
during the fourth quarter of  the company repurchased boats from one of its dealers pursuant to the guarantee described above 
the net sales recorded on the original sale of the boats was approximately  and the company was obligated to pay approximately percent of the net sales to satisfy the obligation to the lender 
prior to year end  the company sold some of the boats to a replacement dealer generating net sales of about  the net sales recorded on the original sale of these boats less amounts sold to other dealers were reversed and the related boats are included in inventory at december  subsequent to year end  the company has  in the normal course of business  sold substantially all of the remaining boats 
as of december   obligations remaining on the outstanding guarantees totaled approximately  the company s retirement income plan  a trusteed defined benefit pension plan  provides monthly benefits upon retirement at age to eligible employees 
in the first quarter of  the company s board of directors approved a resolution to cease all future retirement benefit accruals under the retirement income plan effective march  however  the adverse conditions in the equity markets  along with the low interest rate environment  have had an unfavorable impact on the funded status of the company s defined benefit pension plan 
additional contributions to the pension plan may be required in to achieve the company s funding objectives 
we believe the liquidity provided by our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  our overall strong capitalization  and cash expected to be generated from operations  will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our requirements for at least the next twelve months 
we believe our liquidity will allow us the ability to continue to grow and provide us the opportunity to take advantage of strategic business opportunities that may arise 
related party transactions effective with the spin off  rpc established a cash balance at marine products of approximately million by contributing million  and cancelled a remaining receivable from rpc totaling approximately  effective february   the company began receiving certain administrative services from rpc 
the service agreements are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
the company s cost for such services aggregated approximately  in and  in during  the company paid  to a division of rpc for the purchase  installation and service of overhead cranes 
the company s directors are also directors of rpc and certain officers are employees of both the company and rpc 
seasonality marine products quarterly operating results are affected by weather and the general economic conditions in the united states 
quarterly operating results for the second quarter have historically recorded the highest sales volume for the year 
the results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in any future period 
inflation inflation has not had a material effect on marine product s operations 
if inflation increases  marine products will attempt to increase its prices to offset its increased expenses 
no assurance can be given  however  that the company will be able to adequately increase its prices in response to inflation 
inflation can also impact marine products sales and profitability 
new boat buyers typically finance their purchases 
because higher inflation results in higher interest rates  the cost of boat ownership increases 
prospective buyers may choose to delay their purchases or buy a less expensive boat
