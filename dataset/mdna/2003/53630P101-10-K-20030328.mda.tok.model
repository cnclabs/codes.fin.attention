see forward looking statements on page ii 
overview we are a development stage biotechnology company that is conducting research and developing products and processes intended to treat major medical conditions in which lipids  or fat components  play a key role 
our technologies are based on a patented process that selectively removes lipids from proteins 
we believe that this unique delipidation process has the potential for far reaching implications for human health 
it may provide an effective therapeutic effect on many infectious agents  including the viruses that cause aids  hepatitis b and c  as well as reverse cardio and cerebrovascular disease 
our primary activities since incorporation have been conducting research and development  performing business  strategic and financial planning  and raising capital 
accordingly  the company is considered to be in the development stage 
we are developing our basic delipidation technology as two complementary technology platforms 
the first platform  viral pathogen inactivation vpi tm is designed to remove lipid from lipid enveloped viruses  bacteria and other lipid enveloped infectious agents 
examples of viruses with lipid envelopes that may be treatable by our vpi system include hiv  hepatitis b  and hepatitis c 
the second platform  vascular lipid removal vlr tm is focused on treating atherosclerosis  which results from an overabundance of lipids in the vascular system 
our vlr platform is targeted at treating conditions such as heart disease  stroke and peripheral vascular disease 
on november   we completed our merger with pre merger lipid 
as a result of the merger  the company was renamed lipid sciences  inc pre merger lipid ceased to exist as a separate corporation  and the shareholders of pre merger lipid became shareholders of the company 
in connection with the merger  pre merger lipid shareholders received shares of our common stock for each share of pre merger lipid common stock they held at the time the merger was completed 
after the transaction  the pre merger lipid shareholders owned approximately of the then outstanding stock of the company and the nz shareholders owned the remaining shares of the company s common stock 

table of contents the merger with nz was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and was treated as a reverse acquisition because the stockholders of pre merger lipid owned the majority of our common stock immediately after the merger 
pre merger lipid was considered the acquiror for accounting and financial reporting purposes 
accordingly  all financial information prior to november  included in this report reflects pre merger lipid results 
in connection with the merger  the company is obligated to issue additional shares of common stock to those individuals and entities who were stockholders of nz on the day prior to the completion of the merger and who perfected their stock rights  unless during the month period immediately following the merger  the closing price per share of the company s common stock equals or exceeds per share throughout any period of consecutive trading days  in which the aggregate volume of shares traded equals or exceeds  shares 
each perfected right entitles the holder to receive up to one additional share of the company s common stock 
stockholders had until april  to perfect their rights and must continue to hold their shares in direct registered form through november  to qualify to receive the additional stock with respect to each perfected right 
transfer of shares before november  will disqualify the right with respect to each of the transferred shares 
if additional shares are issued pursuant to the rights  the issuance of additional shares of common stock will have the effect of diluting the ownership of stockholders not holding rights and increasing the proportionate ownership of the stockholders holding rights 
as of december    rights were perfected with an additional  rights pending determination 
if all of the holders of perfected rights remain qualified to receive the additional shares on november   the issuance will dilute stockholders by up to  based on  shares outstanding as of december  in the course of our research and development activities  we have sustained continued operating losses and we expect these losses to continue for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in research and development and begin to allocate significant and increasing resources to clinical testing and other activities related to seeking approval to market our products 
we approved a discontinued operations plan on march   to dispose of substantially all of the real estate and other assets held by the company before the merger see note of the consolidated financial statements 
during  we disposed of most of the assets in the discontinued operations plan 
we intend to finance our operations through the disposition of the remaining assets  through public or private equity or debt financings  the pursuit of research and development grants  and cash on hand 
in the longer term  we expect to additionally finance our operations through revenues from product sales and licenses upon receiving all relevant approvals 
if adequate funds are not available to satisfy our requirements  we may have to substantially reduce  or eliminate  certain areas of our product development activities  significantly limit our operations  or otherwise modify our business strategy 
our business is organized into two segments biotechnology and real estate 
our biotechnology segment is focused on research and development of products and processes intended to treat major medical conditions in which lipid  or fat components play a key role 
as a result of the merger with nz on november   certain real estate assets  including commercial real estate loans were acquired 
as part of the merger  we announced our intent to conduct an orderly disposition of these assets and on march   we formalized a plan to discontinue the operations of our real estate segment 
the plan identified the major assets to be disposed of  the expected method of disposal  and the period expected to be required for completion of the disposal 
as of december   we recorded restructuring charges of approximately  which were charged to general and administrative expense 
our restructuring initiatives involved strategic decisions to exit the real estate market through the orderly disposition of substantially all of nz s assets 
as of december   we have utilized approximately  of the accruals set up for restructuring purposes 
we expect the restructuring to be completed in the first half of with all accrued amounts paid within twelve months of the restructuring completion see note of the consolidated financial statements 
on january   we announced a new strategic direction for the company and the application and development of our novel technology of plasma delipidation 
as a result  we are focusing our research and development on our proprietary vpi platform 
the first indication being pursued by the company to 
table of contents demonstrate the efficacy of our vpi platform technology is hiv 
in connection with this new strategic direction we have discontinued our phase human clinical trial in australia  which was paused in the third quarter of  and ceased all operations in australia 
in addition  we are aligning our clinical trial efforts toward the development of our vpi platform and us based clinical trials 
although our strategic plan is projected to reduce operating expenses in the second half of by approximately to when measured against the same period in  we cannot assure you that such reduction will be sufficient to permit the company to succeed in its development efforts with currently available funds 
the new direction is part of a comprehensive strategic plan being implemented by the company 
in connection with the adoption of that plan  we also have restructured our business operations 
the strategic plan was recommended by the management team and approved by the board of directors 
as part of the cost savings goal of the strategic plan  barry d 
michaels resigned as chief financial officer and certain other management and other staff positions have been eliminated 
sandra gardiner  the company s vice president  controller and corporate secretary  has assumed the newly created position of chief accounting officer 
in related appointments  marc bellotti  who was vice president of product development  has assumed the position of vice president  research and development 
dale richardson  who was vice president of marketing and sales  has assumed the position of vice president  business development 
we are currently considering candidates to fill the position of president and chief executive officer  a position that has been vacant since phil radlick  phd  resigned on october  although we believe our strategic plan will lead to a reduction in our operational expenses  we cannot assure you that such reduction will be realized 
critical accounting policies in december  the securities and exchange commission  or sec  required that all registrants disclose and describe their critical accounting policies in md a 
the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
in applying those policies  our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
those estimates are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
we believe that our following accounting policies fit this definition property and equipment real estate properties are stated at the lower of cost or estimated fair value 
all properties are held for sale and are written down to estimated fair value when the company determines the carrying cost exceeds the estimated selling price  less costs to sell 
management makes this evaluation on a property by property basis 
the evaluation of fair value and future cash flows from individual properties requires significant judgment 
our estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
our estimates of fair value represent our best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 
it is reasonably possible that a change in economic or market conditions could result in a change in management s estimate of fair value 
loans and notes receivable all loans and notes receivable are held for sale and are written down to estimated fair value when the company determines that the loan is impaired 
among the factors used to determine whether a loan is impaired are creditworthiness of the borrower  whether or not the loan is performing  the value of any collateral for the loan  collectibility of the loan  and general economic and market conditions 
the determination of whether a loan is impaired requires significant judgment 
our estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
our conclusions are based on factors that are inherently uncertain 
it is reasonably possible that a change in economic or market conditions could result in a change in management s estimate of fair value 

table of contents stock compensation the company accounts for stock options granted to employees using the intrinsic value method in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and  thus  recognizes no compensation expense for those options granted with exercise prices equal to the fair market value of the company s common stock on the date of grant 
as permitted  the company has elected to adopt the disclosure provisions only of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
the company accounts for its stock based awards to non employees in accordance with sfas no 
see note of the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes the company follows sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under the asset and liability method of sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto which begin on page f of this report which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
results of continuing operations years ended december  and net revenue 
we have had no revenues from continuing operations since inception may  
future revenues will depend on our ability to develop and commercialize our two primary platforms for the treatment of lipid enveloped viruses viral pathogen inactivation system and cardiovascular disease vascular lipid removal system 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses include product development  clinical testing  and regulatory expenses 
research and development expenses for increased to  from  in the increase in research and development expenses is due primarily to the on going development of the device component of our delipidation systems  expenses associated with our human clinical trial  including  paid to aruba international upon the commencement of our human clinical trial  and staff additions in the research and development and clinical areas 
research and development expenses account for approximately of total operating expenses for the twelve months ended december  our first human clinical trial commenced during the second quarter of the phase trial was being conducted in australia to determine the safety of our plasma delipidation process 
after an adverse reaction in a volunteer  the trial was voluntarily paused during the third quarter of the preliminary results from this trial advanced the science and improved the safety of our proprietary delipidation process 
we believe we have identified and mitigated the cause of the adverse event experienced in that trial 
however  for strategic 
table of contents reasons  we have discontinued our phase human clinical trial and ceased all operations in australia 
furthermore  we have decided to align our clinical trial efforts toward the development of our vpi platform and us based clinical trials 
we anticipate that our research and development expenses will continue for the foreseeable future as we conduct clinical trials necessary for us to apply for regulatory approval to market our products 
while we allocate and track resources when required pursuant to the terms of development arrangements  our research team typically works on different products concurrently  and our equipment and intellectual property resources often are deployed over a range of products with a view to maximize the benefit of our investment 
accordingly  we have not  and do not intend to  separately track the costs for each of our research projects on a product by product basis 
for the year ended december   however  we estimate that the majority of our research and development expense was associated with our two primary platforms  lipid enveloped viruses viral pathogen inactivation system and cardiovascular vascular lipid removal system 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for increased to  from  in the increase is due primarily to costs to conduct business as a public company  including accounting  legal  stockholder and filing fees 
public company related expenses accounted for approximately of the increase in general and administrative expenses 
the balance of the increase in such expenses is primarily due to expenses to establish administrative management  and director fees and expenses 
general and administrative expenses account for approximately of total operating expenses for the twelve months ended december  interest and other income 
interest and other income for decreased to  from  in the decrease is due primarily to lower cash  cash equivalent and short term investment balances throughout results of continuing operations years ended december  and period from inception may  to december  net revenue

selling  general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for increased to  from  in the period from inception may  to december  the increase is due primarily to expenses to establish administrative management including recruitment fees  accounting  legal  shareholder and filing fees associated with public company requirements  and restructuring costs see note of the consolidated financial statements associated with the merger

table of contents results of discontinued operations years ended december   and during the years ended december   and  the disposal of real estate assets generated cash of approximately   and zero  respectively  and we collected approximately   and zero  respectively  in principal payments from commercial real estate notes and other notes receivable 
in may  we paid approximately  to purchase a first position mortgage loan  which was in superior lien position to our second position mortgage loan  on residential lots in san diego county  california 
we purchased the first mortgage because the lender was foreclosing  leaving our second position mortgage unsecured and possibly unrecoverable 
the foreclosure process was completed and the property was acquired in july we have undertaken certain development activities left unfinished by our borrower  in order to prepare the lots for sale 
during  we made significant progress under our plan of disposition 
we reduced the total assets in the disposal group by  from approximately  to  we also reduced the total liabilities in the disposal group by  from approximately  to as of december   the remaining assets in the disposal group were primarily one commercial real estate loan  notes receivable in connection with seller provided financing of prior sales of real estate  approximately  acres of certain mineral rights in new mexico  vacant industrial land in new mexico  and residential lots in new mexico and california 
no new real estate activity is anticipated  except as necessary for the ultimate disposition of the assets 
liquidity and capital resources pre merger lipid financed its operations principally through two private placements of equity securities  which yielded net proceeds of approximately  and the sale of common stock to one of its founders 
the merger with nz resulted in the acquisition of net assets of approximately  net of repurchase of stock and acquisition costs  through december  the net cash used in operating activities was approximately   and  for the years ended december  and and the period from inception may  to december   respectively  resulting primarily from operating losses incurred as adjusted for income taxes and non cash stock compensation charges

ltd  an australian company  controlled by bill e 
cham  phd  a founding stockholder of pre merger lipid and a former director 
as consideration for the license  we issued  shares of our common stock valued at  to aruba

for the years ended december  and  we have expensed approximately  and  respectively  related to this agreement 
amounts for  and were charged to research and development expense 
in may  we sold a total of  shares of common stock at per share in a private placement to accredited investors 
net cash proceeds  after expenses  were approximately  in october  we entered into a development agreement with sri international  a california nonprofit public benefit corporation  pursuant to which sri provides us with various consulting and development services 
sri will assign to us all intellectual property developed during the term of the development agreement 
the development agreement calls for sri to complete two development phases as defined in the development agreement  phase i and phase ii during which time sri will work to develop a medical device to enable us to further develop and commercialize our lipid removal technology 
in addition  we have entered into a number of amendments with sri to address work performed by sri  which are both within and outside of the scope of work of phase ii development 
certain of the amendments have been in support of product development and certain of the amendments relate to supplemental testing and analysis performed by sri 
we also issued sri warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrants vested with respect to  shares upon completion of phase i  with the remaining  shares vesting upon completion of phase ii 
on may   the development agreement was amended with respect to the warrants to purchase  shares of common stock related to phase ii

phase i was completed on march  fees for services performed by sri for phase i totaled  of these total fees  funding of  and  was charged to operations in the year ended december  and the period from inception may  to december   respectively 
the completion of phase i resulted in warrants to purchase  shares of common stock becoming fully vested 
on this date  we recognized an expense of  based upon the fair market value of the warrants on the date of vesting  using the black scholes method with the following assumptions a volatility of  a dividend yield of  a risk free interest rate of  and a life of seven years 
phase ii was initiated upon completion of phase i 
fees for phase ii of the development program were limited to  on july   funding to sri for the continued development of phase ii was increased to  for the years ended december  and  approximately  and  respectively  was charged to operations for fees related to phase ii 
as of december   neither milestone related to phase ii was completed  consequently no value has been assigned to the  warrants which vest upon completion of such milestone 
these warrants will be valued using the black scholes method and will be charged to expense as they vest 
consistent with our new strategic direction announced on january   we have refocused sri efforts to support our vpi platform and spending related to phase ii development has been significantly reduced 
in march  we closed a private placement of  shares of common stock at per share for gross proceeds of  in connection with the private placement  we paid a commission to mdb capital group  llc of approximately of the gross proceeds  payable in shares of common stock  for services rendered in the private placement 
accordingly   shares of common stock at per share were issued as commission for the transaction 
mr 
marlett  the previous chairman of our board of directors  is a manager and majority owner of mdb capital group 

table of contents in june  pre merger lipid engaged mdb capital group  llc as its financial advisor in the merger between nz and pre merger lipid 
the engagement letter commits the company to pay mdb capital group an advisory fee 
in december  we paid mdb capital group approximately  which represents a portion of the advisory fee and is based on of the cash and cash equivalents of the company immediately after the merger  as compared to pre merger lipid s cash and cash equivalents immediately prior to the merger 
the remainder of the advisory fee is based on of the gross sales of the company s pre merger assets during the two year period after the closing of the merger  the company s assets on the two year anniversary of the merger and the net operating income of the company derived from the company s pre merger assets during the two year period after the closing of the merger 
approximately  of the advisory fee was paid during the twelve months ended december  we anticipate the remainder of the advisory fee to be approximately  our adoption of a formalized plan to dispose of all real estate segment assets by march  will likely result in the payment of substantially all mdb capital group advisory fees by third quarter additionally  in the normal course of business  we have consulted with dr 
cham  and companies with which he is affiliated  regarding various matters relating to research and development 
the amount expensed under these consultations amounted to approximately  and  in the year ended december  and the period from inception may  to december   respectively  for fees charged by dr 
cham  including travel and similar costs  and have been included in the results of operations 
in november  we entered into a service agreement with karuba international pty 
ltd  a company controlled by dr 
cham  in order to consolidate such consulting services 
we were required to pay approximately  a year for karuba s consulting services  as well as out of pocket expenses incurred in the performance of such services 
under the terms of the agreement  the annual obligation to karuba increased to approximately  per year in may this agreement  the initial term of which expired on november   automatically renews every year 
either party may terminate the agreement  without cause  upon thirty days written notice 
however  if we terminate the agreement  we will be required to pay karuba an amount equal to one third of the annual fee 
for the years ended december  and  approximately  and  respectively  was expensed to research and development under this agreement of which approximately  and  is included in accounts payable at december  and  respectively 
we have a non cancelable lease agreement for the office space in pleasanton  california  which expires in rent expense for   and was approximately   and  respectively 
future minimum lease payments under this lease agreement total  in the course of its research and development activities  the company has sustained continued operating losses and expects those losses to continue for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in research and development and begin to allocate significant and increasing resources for clinical testing and related activities 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments equal to approximately million 
we anticipate that these assets and the cash raised from the disposal of remaining assets included in the discontinued operations plan will provide sufficient working capital for our research and development activities for at least the next year 
we expect additional capital will be required in the future 
we intend to seek capital needed to fund our operations through new collaborations  such as licensing or other arrangements  through pursuit of research and development grants or through public or private equity or debt financings 
additional financing may not be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms  our ability to continue our business as planned will be significantly harmed
