the preparation of these financial statements requires prime to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
prime bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
prime believes the following critical accounting policies affect more significant judgements and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
property  equipment and leasehold improvements property  equipment and leasehold improvements that the company intends to continue to operate are stated at their fair market value as of july  plus the cost of acquisitions subsequent to that date less accumulated depreciation and amortization from august  provision is made for depreciation and amortization using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred 
replacements and betterments are capitalized 
construction in progress represents costs incurred in the development of hotels 
such costs include construction costs and capitalized interest 
the company reviews each of its assets held for use for which indicators of impairment are present to determine whether the carrying amount of the asset will be recovered 
the company recognizes impairment if the future undiscounted cash flows before interest charges are less than the carrying amount 
assets held for sale are recorded at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell 
long lived assets in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  which supersedes fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
however it retains the fundamental provisions of that statement related to the recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used 
in addition  the statement provides more guidance on estimating cash flows when performing a recoverability test  requires that a long lived asset or asset group to be disposed of other than by sale eg abandoned be classified as held and used until it is disposed of  and establishes more restrictive criteria to classify an asset or asset group as held for sale 
sfas superseded apb opinion  reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring transactions 
sfas extended the reporting of a discontinued operation to a component of an entity 
therefore  the operations of assets held for sale or assets sold are required to be presented as discontinued operations in the company s statement of operations 
the company adopted this pronouncement on january  this resulted in the company having to reclassify certain revenues and expenses to discontinued operations for sold properties where the company did not retain management 
this adoption had no impact on the company s net income or financial position 
investments in unconsolidated joint ventures the company accounts for its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures under the equity method of accounting as the company exercises significant influence  but does not control these entities 
these investments are recorded initially at cost  as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures  and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings loss and cash contributions and distributions 
any difference between the carrying amount of these investments on the balance sheet of the company and the underlying equity in net assets is amortized as an adjustment to equity in earnings loss of unconsolidated joint ventures over the lesser of the joint venture term or years 
as of december   investments in unconsolidated joint ventures consisted of the company s ownership interest in one hotel 
there is no joint venture debt as of december  insurance programs the company uses an incurred loss retrospective insurance plan for general and auto liability and workers compensation 
predetermined loss limits have been arranged with insurance companies to limit the company s per occurrence and aggregate cash outlay 
the company maintains a self insurance program for major medical and hospitalization coverage for employees and dependents  which is partially funded by payroll deductions 
payments for major medical and hospitalization below specified aggregate annual amounts are self insured by the company 
claims for benefits in excess of these amounts are covered by insurance purchased by the company 
provisions have been made in the consolidated financial statements which represent the expected future payments based on the estimated ultimate cost for incidents  less insured amounts  incurred through the balance sheet date and are included in other current and other long term liabilities based on the expected payment dates 
revenue recognition room revenue and other revenues are recognized when earned 
management and franchise fee revenues are recognized when all material services or conditions relating to the respective property or franchisee have been substantially performed or satisfied by the company 
such revenues  when recognized  are included in management  franchise and other fees on the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
gains and losses resulting from sales of hotels are recorded in full when title is conveyed to the buyer and when various criteria are met relating to the buyer s financial commitment and any subsequent involvement by the company with respect to the hotels being sold 
the company s sales of hotels are sometimes accompanied by a leaseback of the facilities under operating lease arrangements 
such sales are recognized when the above sales criteria are met and certain specific criteria are met relating to the lease terms 
related profit is deferred and is recognized as income over the remaining lease term 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in november of  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantors accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
the interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
this interpretation does not prescribe a specific approach for subsequently measuring the guarantor s recognized liability over the term of the related guarantee 
the disclosure provisions of this interpretation are effective for the company s december  financial statements 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact that this interpretation will have on its financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation clarifies the application of existing accounting pronouncements to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
the provisions of the interpretation will be immediately effective for all variable interests in variable interest entities created after january   and the company will need to apply its provisions to any existing variable interests in variable interest entities by no later than september  the company does not believe that this interpretation will have a significant impact on the company s financial statements 
item a

at december   the company had million of debt outstanding of which million bears interest at fixed rates 
the interest rate on the company s credit facility  under which million was outstanding at december   is variable at a rate of libor 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move increase on short term interest rates on the floating rate debt outstanding at december  would adversely affect prime s annual interest cost by approximately million assuming borrowed amounts under the credit facility remained at million
