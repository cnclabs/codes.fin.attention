item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements of reckson associates realty corp 
the company and related notes thereto 
the company considers certain statements set forth herein to be forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  with respect to the company s expectations for future periods 
certain forward looking statements  including  without limitation  statements relating to the timing and success of acquisitions and the completion of development or redevelopment of properties  the financing of the company s operations  the ability to lease vacant space and the ability to renew or relet space under expiring leases  involve risks and uncertainties 
many of the forward looking statements can be identifed by the use of words such as believes  may  expects  anticipates  intends or similar expressions 
although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions  the actual results may differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements and the company can give no assurance that its expectation will be achieved 
among those risks  trends and uncertainties are the general economic climate  including the conditions affecting industries in which our principal tenants compete  changes in the supply of and demand for office and industrial r d properties in the new york tri state area  changes in interest rate levels  downturns in rental rate levels in our markets and our ability to lease or re lease space in a timely manner at current or anticipated rental rate levels  the availability of financing to us or our tenants  financial condition of our tenants  changes in operating costs  including utility  security and insurance costs  repayment of debt owed to the company by third parties including frontline capital group  risks associated with joint ventures  liability for uninsured losses or environmental matters  and other risks associated with the development and acquisition of properties  including risks that development may not be completed on schedule  that the tenants will not take occupancy or pay rent  or that development or operating costs may be greater than anticipated 
consequently  such forward looking statements should be regarded solely as reflections of the company s current operating and development plans and estimates 
these plans and estimates are subject to revisions from time to time as additional information becomes available  and actual results may differ from those indicated in the referenced statements 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements of the company include accounts of the company and all majority owned and controlled subsidiaries 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes 
in preparing these financial statements  management has utilized information available including its past history  industry standards and the current economic environment  among other factors  in forming its estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the consolidated financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
it is possible that the ultimate outcome as anticipated by management in formulating its estimates inherent in these financial statements may not materialize 
however  application of the critical accounting policies below involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
in addition  other companies may utilize different estimates  which may impact comparability of the company s results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable rental revenue is recognized on a straight line basis  which averages minimum rents over the terms of the leases 
the excess of rents recognized over amounts contractually due are included in deferred rents receivable on the company s balance sheets 
the leases also typically provide for tenant reimbursements of common area maintenance and other operating expenses and real estate taxes 
ancillary and other property related income is recognized in the period earned 
ii the company makes estimates of the collectibility of its accounts receivables related to base rents  tenant escalations and reimbursements and other revenue or income 
the company specifically analyzes tenant receivables and analyzes historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of its allowance for doubtful accounts 
in addition  when tenants are in bankruptcy the company makes estimates of the expected recovery of pre petition administrative and damage claims 
in some cases  the ultimate resolution of those claims can exceed beyond a year 
these estimates have a direct impact on the company s net income  because a higher bad debt reserve results in less net income 
the company records interest income on investments in mortgage notes and notes receivable on an accrual basis of accounting 
the company does not accrue interest on impaired loans where  in the judgment of management  collection of interest according to the contractual terms is considered doubtful 
among the factors the company considers in making an evaluation of the collectibility of interest are i the status of the loan  ii the value of the underlying collateral  iii the financial condition of the borrower and iv anticipated future events 
gain on sales of real estate are recorded when title is conveyed to the buyer  subject to the buyer s financial commitment being sufficient to provide economic substance to the sale and the company having no substantial continuing involvement with the buyer 
real estate land  buildings and improvements  furniture  fixtures and equipment are recorded at cost 
tenant improvements  which are included in buildings and improvements  are also stated at cost 
expenditures for ordinary maintenance and repairs are expensed to operations as they are incurred 
renovations and or replacements  which improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
depreciation is computed utilizing the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of ten to thirty years for buildings and improvements and five to ten years for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
tenant improvements are amortized on a straight line basis over the term of the related leases 
the company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflect on an annual basis with respect to those properties 
these assessments have a direct impact on the company s net income 
should the company lengthen the expected useful life of a particular asset  it would be depreciated over more years  and result in less depreciation expense and higher annual net income 
assessment by the company of certain other lease related costs must be made when the company has a reason to believe that the tenant will not be able to execute under the term of the lease as originally expected 
long lived assets on a periodic basis  management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the real estate properties may be impaired 
a property s value is impaired only if management s estimate of the aggregate future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges to be generated by the property are less than the carrying value of the property 
such cash flows consider factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of demand  competition and other factors 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss will be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the fair value of the property 
the company is required to make subjective assessments as to whether there are impairments in the value of its real estate properties and other investments 
these assessments have a direct impact on the company s net income  because taking an impairment results in an immediate negative adjustment to net income 
in determining impairment  if any  the company has adopted financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
ii stock based compensation effective january  the company has elected to follow fasb statement no

the company expects minimal financial impact from the adoption of statement no 
to determine the fair value of the stock options granted  the company uses a black scholes option pricing model 
historically  the company had applied accounting principles board opinion no 
and related interpretations in accounting for its stock option plans and reported pro forma disclosures in its form k filings by estimating the fair value of options issued and the related expense in accordance with statement no 
accordingly  no compensation cost had been recognized for its stock option plans prior to the company s adoption of statement no
