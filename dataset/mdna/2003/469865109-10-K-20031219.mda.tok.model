we were originally formed in when we were spun off from hanson 
at that time  we had holdings in diverse businesses  including jacuzzi and rexair  and we subsequently acquired zurn in we recently completed an asset disposal program that transformed us from a diversified industrial conglomerate into a focused operating company primarily serving the home and building products markets 
as a result of this program  the financial information presented for any one period may not be comparable to that of any other period

in the second quarter of  we sold our fire protection businesses  which were part of our previously defined bath plumbing segment  for million

we have included the financial results of each of these businesses as part of our results of continuing operations through the date of its sale 
however  certain estimates made in connection with these dispositions may need to be adjusted in future periods 
our board of directors approved a formal disposal plan for the sale of five businesses in december and a formal disposal plan for the sale of three businesses in february we have completed the sale of all businesses under both disposal plans 
the results of these discontinued businesses are excluded from our results from continuing operations for all periods presented and from any discussions of our continuing operating results 
they are  however  included in our results from discontinued operations and are discussed separately under dispositions and discontinued operations

in june  we sold our hearth business  which was part of our previously defined bath plumbing segment  for million in cash 
in october  we sold our water systems business  which was part of our previously defined bath plumbing segment  for million in cash 
with the completion of our and asset disposal programs  we have largely completed our transformation into an operating company 
we continue to explore strategic alternatives to improve our operating efficiencies 
in the first half of fiscal  we combined six separate operating facilities into one new facility in chino  ca 
additionally  we have adopted a number of efficiency enhancing manufacturing techniques  including lean manufacturing techniques  to further improve our cost structure 
while we have experienced some initial inefficiency  we believe that this new facility will enhance our operations significantly 
we also announced the closing of our manufacturing plants in plant city  fl and salem  oh 
the plant city plant  which manufactured spas  was closed in november their production demands were absorbed by our main spa facility located in chino  ca 
the salem plant  which manufactures cast iron sanitary ware  will be closed during fiscal  and the production will be outsourced to an overseas supplier at a lower cost 
these restructuring initiatives are discussed in more detail under impairment  restructuring and other charges 
while we have no specific plans at this time  we continue to evaluate strategies to improve the results of certain under performing product lines within our bath product segment 
we believe that there remains significant potential for further rationalization of our bath product segment s cost structure 
implementation of these strategies could result in our recording charges in future periods  including charges related to asset impairments 
we redefined our business segments in fiscal to reflect changes made to our management structure and the way we evaluate our businesses see note to our audited consolidated financial statements 
we currently operate as three business segments  consisting of a bath products segment  a plumbing products segment and a rexair segment 
the bath products segment manufactures whirlpool baths  spas  showers  sanitary ware  including sinks and toilets  and bathtubs for the residential construction and remodeling markets 
the plumbing products segment manufactures professional grade drainage  water control  commercial brass and pex piping products primarily for the commercial and institutional construction  renovation and facilities maintenance markets 
the rexair segment manufactures premium vacuum cleaner systems sold through independent distributors in the direct sales retail channel 
the bath products segment and plumbing products segment were previously classified by management as the bath plumbing products segment 
over the last three years  we engaged in a number of transactions with respect to our indebtedness that affected our operating results for those periods 
on august   we restructured our previous bank financing arrangements by amending and restating two credit facilities 
one facility  which was our principal credit facility  provided for an aggregate of million of term and revolving loans available to 
table of contents us and certain of our subsidiaries excluding rexair 
the other facility  which we refer to as the rexair facility  provided for an aggregate of million of term and revolving loans available to rexair 
as part of our debt reduction program  we repaid and permanently reduced the commitments under these amended and restated credit facilities collectively the restructured facilities with proceeds from asset disposals and cash flow from operations 
in addition  early in fiscal we completed a restructuring of our senior notes 
prior to this restructuring  we had outstanding million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due and million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in november  we completed an exchange offer in which we exchanged million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due for million in cash and million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due in november  we completed an offer to redeem million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due on july   we completed a comprehensive re financing of our corporate debt by closing on the issuance of million in aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes the new notes as well as a new five year million asset based revolving credit facility and a five year million term loan collectively the bank facilities 
the proceeds from the new notes  together with the initial borrowings under the bank facilities were used to repay the outstanding debt under our then outstanding debt facilities and fund the redemption of the senior notes  the senior notes and the senior notes old notes 
for more information on the transactions that relate to our previously outstanding debt facilities  senior notes and debt refinancing  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
demand for our products is primarily driven by new home starts  remodeling and commercial construction activity 
accordingly  many external factors affect our business including weather and the impact of the broader economy on our end markets 
weather is an important variable for us as it significantly impacts both residential and non residential construction 
spring and summer months in the us and europe represent the main construction season for new housing starts and remodeling  as well as increased construction in the commercial and institutional markets 
as a result  sales in our bath products and plumbing products segments increase significantly in our third and fourth fiscal quarters 
conversely  we experience lower sales during our first and second fiscal quarters as the autumn and winter months generally decrease outside construction and installation activity 
housing starts  consumer spending and remodeling expenditures have a major impact on our consumer focused bath and spa businesses  which is served by our bath products segment 
our plumbing products business is dependent upon commercial and institutional construction activity and is therefore affected by macroeconomic factors such as the unemployment rate and the availability of financing 
despite the cyclical nature of commercial and institutional construction  including declines of approximately in fiscal and approximately in fiscal  our commercial and institutional products business has grown sales over the past year by enhancing our product offerings with new product introductions 

table of contents results of operations the following table presents our results of operations by segment for the periods indicated 
certain amounts reported for the prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current year s presentation 
for the fiscal years ended september  in millions net sales bath products plumbing products rexair total net sales operating income loss bath products plumbing products rexair corporate expenses total operating income loss fiscal compared to fiscal overall overall sales increased million or in fiscal year when compared to fiscal the results reflect sales increases in each of our operating segments  with the most significant increases achieved in our bath products segment 
fiscal results of our plumbing products segment include million in sales recognized upon the granting of a license for certain technology that had been the subject of patent litigation 
operating income decreased million or in fiscal as compared to fiscal included in our fiscal results are million of impairment  restructuring and other charges  of which million is included in cost of products sold  while our fiscal results include restructuring and other charges of million 
for detailed information on these charges see our discussion under impairment  restructuring and other charges 
the decrease in operating income  beyond the net impact of the impairment  restructuring and other charges  is primarily due to a decrease in operating results in our bath products segment as more fully described below 
bath products net sales in our bath products segment increased by million or in fiscal as compared with fiscal approximately million of the increase or was due to the firming of the british pound and the euro against the us dollar 
the remaining increase was primarily the result of increased sales of our bath products in the uk and our spas here in the us in addition to the introduction of our jacuzzi whirlpool bath product lines into the nearly lowe s home centers in the u 
s 
the increase in the sales for uk bath products was primarily attributable to additional sales to focus and homebase  two leading uk homecenter retailers 
the increase in sales of our domestic spas was the result of strong sales and marketing efforts and an expanded specialty retail dealer base 
operating income of million for fiscal includes million of restructuring and other charges primarily related to the closure of two plants  while operating income of million for fiscal includes million of restructuring and other charges related to the elimination of an executive layer of management 
a separate discussion of these charges can be found under impairment  
table of contents restructuring and other charges 
excluding these charges  operating income decreased as favorable sales volume was offset by labor inefficiencies and start up costs related to the move to a new whirlpool bath manufacturing facility in chino  ca  costs of process improvements to enhance quality and future operating efficiencies at the new chino  ca plant  costs related to the lowe s roll out  higher insurance costs  increased marketing expenses and escalating costs associated with our cast iron and sanitary ware businesses 
in addition  we established a million reserve against a note receivable from a customer in fiscal in accordance with sfas no 
favorable currency exchange rates improved earnings by million for the year 
the costs associated with the move to the new whirlpool bath plant in chino  ca  process improvements at the new plant and the lowe s roll out are not expected to continue into the higher insurance costs are primarily associated with higher workers compensation costs at our southern california spa and whirlpool bath manufacturing facilities 
the increase in marketing expenses reflects an increased investment in the strong portfolio of brand names within our bath products segment 
this level of investment is expected to continue into the future 
the escalating costs associated with our cast iron business has led us to conclude that we can no longer economically produce cast iron products and have recently announced the planned closure of our salem  oh cast iron manufacturing facility in fiscal the shut down will result in additional charges in of approximately million primarily for severance and plant shut down costs 
we plan to relinquish production of our cast iron products to outside suppliers  who will build them to our design and specification 
we do not expect a material loss of revenue as a result of the closing of the salem  oh plant 
plumbing products net sales in the plumbing products segment increased by million or for fiscal when compared with fiscal fiscal includes million from the sale of a license for technology that had been the subject of patent litigation 
without these revenues  sales still remained ahead of despite continued softness in the us commercial and institutional construction market  which has declined by approximately in fiscal this was accomplished by enhancing product offerings and implementing programs to increase market share 
operating income increased from million of sales in fiscal to million of sales in fiscal fiscal results include restructuring and other charges of million related to a management restructuring and discontinued product lines see impairment  restructuring and other charges 
the increase in operating income  after giving effect for the restructuring and other charges in fiscal  is the result of higher sales and the million sale of the technology license 
without the sale of the license  margins as a percentage of sales would have decreased slightly primarily as a result of changes in the product mix sold 
rexair net sales increased by million in fiscal as compared to fiscal current year sales were positively impacted by an increase in overall unit sales and a price increase implemented at the beginning of fiscal the number of units sold increased in both our domestic and international operations over the prior year 
domestic sales were favorably impacted by the price increase and initiatives to increase the size of our distributorships 
international sales were also favorably impacted by the price increases 
increases in unit sales in the middle east and latin america were partially offset by decreases in europe and asia 
the distributors in the middle east were able to raise sales after benefiting from additional training and support provided by the home office in fiscal latin america saw increased sales because of increased selling effort 
the decreases in europe were primarily attributable to portugal  while sales in asia were impacted by the sars epidemic earlier in the year 
operating income decreased from million of sales in fiscal to million of sales in fiscal increased margins from the increase in sales were offset by decreased overhead absorption of approximately million related to an inventory reduction program and increased 
table of contents compensation costs in fiscal and a decrease in estimated warranty reserves during that increased operating income that year 
corporate expenses corporate expenses increased by million in fiscal  as compared with fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to net restructuring charges in fiscal of million related to the consolidation of corporate offices and a favorable adjustment to prior year reserves related to a corporate lease obligation 
fiscal includes restructuring charges of million related to the same corporate lease obligation see impairment  restructuring and other charges 
we increased the reserve in fiscal when it became apparent that we could not sub lease the empty space 
a portion of the reserve was reversed when we decided to utilize the space for the shared services operations center 
the remaining increase  after giving effect to the net restructuring charges  is primarily due to a million decrease in pension income  reflecting a reduction in the discount rate and expected return on plan assets used in valuing the plans 
partially offsetting these increased costs are decreases in compensation and other personnel related expenses due to staffing reductions as well as decreases in professional fees 
interest income and expense the decrease in interest expense of million from fiscal to fiscal was largely due to lower debt balances resulting from asset disposals  the proceeds of which were used for the repayment of debt 
the decrease in interest income in fiscal was primarily due to the january sale of million in aggregate principal amount of strategic notes we had received as part of the consideration from the sale of our diversified businesses to strategic in march other expense  net other expense  net was million in fiscal compared to million for fiscal fiscal includes million of charges associated with the refinancing of our debt facilities in july  million in expenses associated with retained liabilities of our ladder operations which were sold in october and million of other financing charges related to our debt facilities 
fiscal includes million in financing related charges and million in expenses associated with our ladder operations 
taxes during fiscal  the irs completed its examination of the federal income tax returns for fiscal through as a result of the audit settlement  a tax benefit of million was recorded in fiscal in early november  the irs informed us that it was ready to begin its audit of our returns for years after in addition  one of our subsidiaries is also under audit by the irs for and  a period prior to our acquisition of that subsidiary 
in fiscal  we recorded a tax benefit of million  which was largely attributable to benefits realized as the result of certain asset sales and changes in tax laws regarding the utilization of loss carry backs 
we are able to carry back net operating losses in fiscal for which we had previously established a valuation allowance in fiscal as a result of a change in tax law under the job creation and worker s assistance act of in accordance with sfas no 
 the release of a valuation allowance due to a change in tax law is reflected through continuing operations 
we had established the valuation allowance in fiscal to reflect the uncertainty of the future realization of losses recognized in connection with the disposal plan see dispositions and discontinued operations 

table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal overall overall sales increased million or in fiscal when compared to fiscal due to the inclusion of rexair in our fiscal results 
on august   we re acquired the equity interest in rexair that we had previously sold to strategic in march as part of the sale of our diversified businesses 
we accounted for rexair under the equity method of accounting during the period from march  until august  when we held only a equity interest 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in sales in the bath products segment and a decrease in sales in the plumbing products segment 
overall operating income loss for fiscal and fiscal includes goodwill impairment  restructuring and other charges of million and million  respectively 
also included in fiscal results is goodwill amortization of million 
we stopped amortizing goodwill after the adoption of sfas no 
on october  excluding these items  operating income for fiscal increased over the comparable prior year period due to the inclusion of rexair  partially offset by a decrease in operating income in the bath products and plumbing products segments 
bath products net sales in the bath products segment decreased million or in fiscal in comparison with the prior year 
the segment reported decreased sales in the domestic non premium spa and whirlpool bath product lines  partially offset by sales increases in the uk bath and sink and domestic premium spa product lines and our domestic sanitary ware product line 
the domestic non premium spa and whirlpool bath product lines were affected by reduced sales to home center mass merchants 
the uk bath and sink product lines experienced improved weather conditions and we had implemented customer programs during the period that increased sales to existing customers 
the premium spa product lines have been successful in adding a number of new products and dealers for the jacuzzi and sundance product lines 
foreign currency exchange rates also favorably impacted sales for fiscal by million 
sales of our domestic sanitary ware line of bathroom products increased over fiscal as a result of greater demand in the home center channel 
operating income loss for the bath products segment included restructuring and goodwill impairment charges of million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the fiscal charges of million were severance charges related to management changes at the jacuzzi corporate office as well as our decision to eliminate the executive layer of management in our previously defined bath plumbing segment 
for fiscal  the entire million represented goodwill impairment charges see impairment  restructuring and other charges 
the segment also recorded goodwill amortization of million in fiscal excluding these items  operating income for fiscal decreased as compared to fiscal primarily due to the decrease in sales for the fiscal period 
also contributing to the decrease in fiscal were the costs of consolidating selected whirlpool bath manufacturing facilities into the chino  ca plant  which became fully operational in the first fiscal quarter of these decreases were partially offset by a million reduction in advertising of the jacuzzi brand and an increase in operating margins for the domestic spa product line due to a shift in the sales mix towards the premium spa lines  which are sold at higher margins 
further  exchange rates favorably impacted operating income by million 
plumbing products net sales in the plumbing products segment decreased million or in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the disposal of the segment s european hvac businesses and discontinued product lines in the segment s us brass operations  which contributed approximately million to net sales in fiscal excluding the effects of these transactions  net sales remained virtually unchanged despite softness in the us commercial and institutional construction markets due to a gain in market share across all product groups 
this increase in market share was achieved by enhancing our product line 

table of contents for example  in we introduced a high capacity  pre sloped trench drain with a patented one piece design which provides improved hydraulics and significant labor savings in installation for airport runways and road side drainage 
operating income for the plumbing products segment includes million and million in restructuring and other charges in fiscal and  respectively  the details of which can be found under impairment  restructuring and other charges 
the segment also recorded goodwill amortization of million in fiscal excluding these items  operating income decreased in gross dollars but increased as a percentage of sales largely due to the disposal and discontinuance of less profitable businesses and product lines 
rexair the rexair segment consists solely of the rexair business  which we re acquired from strategic in august while still owned by strategic  rexair recorded sales of million and operating income of million for the period from october  through august  sales and operating income for rexair for the entire year ended september  were million and million  respectively  compared to million and million  respectively  for the year ended september  the sales decrease of million in fiscal from the comparable prior year period is primarily attributable to a decrease in unit sales due to the political uncertainty resulting from events of september  and events in the middle east 
operating income for fiscal includes goodwill amortization of million  which was recorded while rexair was owned by strategic  and intangible asset amortization of million 
operating income for fiscal includes intangible asset amortization of million 
excluding this amortization  the decrease in operating income in fiscal was primarily due to lower sales  partially offset by reduced general and administrative costs and a decrease in their estimated warranty reserves 
corporate expenses corporate expenses increased million in fiscal in comparison with the prior fiscal year primarily due to restructuring charges of million associated with a corporate lease obligation see impairment  restructuring and other charges and an increase in legal and other professional services expenses of approximately million 
interest income and expense interest expense decreased million in fiscal compared to fiscal largely due to lower debt balances resulting from payments made to satisfy the permanent debt reduction requirements under the terms of our then outstanding credit facilities  which were refinanced in fiscal interest income decreased by million in fiscal when compared with the prior fiscal year 
the decrease was largely due to the interest earned on the strategic notes we received from strategic as part of the consideration from the sale of our diversified businesses in march we sold our remaining investment of million in the strategic notes back to strategic in january interest on these notes totaled million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
equity losses in investees we recorded equity losses related to our investment in strategic and rexair of million in fiscal as a result of the rexair re acquisition on august   we now own of rexair 
in january  we sold our remaining equity interests in strategic which we had obtained in march in connection with the sale of our diversified businesses 

table of contents other expense  net other expense  net  was million and million for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
in fiscal  other expense  net includes million in financing related charges and million in expenses associated with liabilities retained when we sold our ladder operations in october in fiscal other expenses  net includes million in impairment charges related to the strategic notes  million in advisory and other related costs associated with our debt restructuring  million of professional fees related to our previously planned spin off of lighting corporation of america and million related to our ladder operations 
taxes in fiscal  we recorded a tax benefit of million  which is largely attributable to benefits that will be realized due to the completion of certain asset sales and changes in tax laws regarding the utilization of loss carry backs 
due to a change in tax law under the job creation and worker s assistance act of  we are able to carry back net operating losses for which we had previously established a valuation allowance 
in accordance with statements of financial accounting standards number sfas no 
 the release of the valuation allowance in was due to a change in tax law and is reflected through continuing operations 
we had established a valuation allowance principally related to deferred tax assets resulting from losses recognized in connection with the disposal plan  reflecting the uncertainty of the future realization of these assets 
for fiscal  the difference between the us statutory rate and our effective tax rate arose principally as a result of the non deductibility of a portion of the goodwill impairments recorded during the year  as well as a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets 
impairment  restructuring and other charges overview the principal components of impairment  restructuring and other charges  including million recorded in cost of products sold in  are for the fiscal years ended september  in millions impairment of goodwill impairment of other assets lease obligations and other commitments severance and related costs total cash charges non cash charges total fiscal impairment  restructuring and other charges we launched several initiatives in fiscal to reduce costs and position ourselves to better accommodate future growth 
below is a summary of the charges we incurred in fiscal associated with 
table of contents those initiatives 
charges are recorded when a liability is incurred in accordance with sfas no 
and sfas no 
or other applicable guidance 
impairment  restructuring and other charges restructuring plant cost of and severance closure products sold charges costs total in millions bath products closure of salem  oh facility closure of plant city  fl facility consolidation of administrative functions dismissal of wholesale sales force sub total bath products corporate expenses adjustment of estimated lease obligation corporate headquarters restructuring sub total corporate expenses total our salem manufacturing plant produces eljer cast iron sanitary ware for retail and wholesale customers 
in recent years  as prices in the retail and wholesale markets have been driven lower  the costs to manufacture product in salem have continued to escalate 
as a result  we have determined that continued manufacturing in salem is not economically feasible 
in  management initiated a plan to close the plant and will exit the facility by the end of fiscal even so  we still plan to be a provider of cast iron products  which will be manufactured to our specification and design by a third party 
we have recorded a million charge associated with the closure of the salem plant 
we estimate that approximately million of the raw materials on hand at september  will need to be scrapped prior to the closure of the plant as a direct result of our decision to exit this facility 
also  as a result of our decision  we performed a recoverability test of the long lived assets and determined that an impairment charge of million was required to reduce the carrying value of these long lived assets to their estimated fair value 
the estimated fair value of the plant was determined based on the value of comparable plants in the area 
our decision to close the plant also resulted in a curtailment of our pension and other post employment benefit plans  leading to a curtailment charge of million 
finally  we have recorded a charge of million associated with other cash commitments of exiting the facility 
we expect to incur another million in charges in fiscal related to this plant closing  primarily for severance and other cash obligations associated with preparing the plant for shut down 
as a result of this plant closing  approximately employees will be terminated 
in fiscal  management approved a plan to close our plant city  fl plant in the first quarter of fiscal the plant was subsequently closed in november this plant produced less than of our spa volume  and production was absorbed by our  state of the art spa manufacturing facility in chino  ca 
in fiscal  we recorded a million charge associated with the closure of the plant city facility 
as a result of our decision to close the plant  we performed a recoverability test of the long lived assets and determined that an impairment charge of million was required to reduce the carrying value of the property  plant and equipment to their estimated fair value 
the estimated fair value of the plant was determined based on the value of comparable plants in the area plus the book value of the equipment that was transferred to our chino facility 
except for costs directly associated 
table of contents with the sale of the facility  we do not expect to incur any additional charges in fiscal associated with this plant closing 
approximately employees were terminated 
we will be consolidating a number of administrative functions into a shared services operations center 
these functions are presently being performed by our domestic whirlpool bath  spa and sanitary bath operations in multiple locations 
the shared services center is expected to be fully operational by the third quarter of fiscal the shared service center will occupy a portion of the unused office space in dallas  tx that has remained vacant since our closing of the zurn corporate office in fiscal we incurred severance charges of million in fiscal  and expect to incur an additional million in fiscal for severance and other related cash obligations 
approximately employees will be terminated as a result of this plan 
management also approved a plan to replace our entire domestic sanitary bath wholesale sales force with independent manufacturer representatives to market our eljer brand products to the wholesale channel on a commission basis 
we incurred million in severance costs in fiscal related to the dismissal of employees in the first quarter of fiscal minimal costs are expected to be incurred in fiscal related to this sales force reduction 
a favorable adjustment of million was recorded in fiscal to reduce the associated restructuring reserves for the space that will be occupied by the shared services center 
the restructuring reserves for the zurn corporate lease obligation were initially established in fiscal and later adjusted in fiscal see fiscal restructuring and other charges 
as of september   we have restructuring reserves of million related to the remaining unused space in dallas 
these costs are expected to be paid over the remaining lease term  which extends through november in april  management initiated a restructuring and consolidation of the corporate headquarters that included a number of management changes and the relocation and consolidation of the jacuzzi headquarters in walnut creek  ca into our principal offices in west palm beach  fl 
this resulted in the termination of employees from california and from florida 
all but one of the employees has been terminated as of september upon approval of our board and stockholders  we also changed our name from us industries  inc to jacuzzi brands  inc 
we incurred charges of million during fiscal related to these initiatives and expect to incur another million in the first quarter of these charges consist primarily of employee severance  lease termination costs  relocation expenses and other related exit costs 
fiscal restructuring and other charges in fiscal  a decision was made to eliminate the executive layer of management and execute other management changes within the segment previously reported as the bath plumbing segment 
this decision resulted in the termination of four employees and a restructuring charge of million  consisting of million in cash severance payments and million in non cash charges associated with the accelerated vesting of restricted stock 
substantially all of the severance had been paid by the end of fiscal operating income in the bath products segment and plumbing products segment included million and million of these charges  respectively 
we also recorded restructuring charges of million in our plumbing products segment to adjust reserves associated with a restructuring plan initiated in a prior year for the discontinuance of a product line 
our estimates of the remaining product liability and warranty claims associated with these products required revision based on updated information 
in fiscal  we also recorded a charge of million to increase reserves associated with a restructuring plan initiated in a prior year 
the charge relates to the zurn corporate lease obligation 
when we initially estimated our lease obligation in fiscal  we assumed that we would be able to sublease portions of the space over the course of the lease 
in fiscal  it became apparent  based on market conditions  that the space would likely remain empty for the remaining term of the lease 

table of contents all charges are classified as impairment  restructuring and other charges in our consolidated statement of operations 
fiscal goodwill impairment charges operating results at a number of our subsidiaries declined during in the third quarter of  we evaluated the recoverability of the goodwill of these subsidiaries based on a fair value methodology

as a result  we recorded goodwill impairment charges totaling million in the bath products segment 
all charges were classified as impairment  restructuring and other charges in our consolidated statement of operations 
restructuring reserves as of september   we had remaining accruals of million for restructuring costs 
the activity in the restructuring liability accounts by cost category is as follows lease and contract severance related and related total costs costs costs in millions at september  fiscal charges cash payments at september  fiscal credits charges cash payments at september  approximately million of the reserves are included in the balance sheet caption accrued expenses and other current liabilities  while the remaining million are recorded in the balance sheet caption other liabilities 
we expect the remaining accruals to be paid with cash over the periods provided by the severance and lease agreements over the next four years 
acquisitions  dispositions and discontinued operations acquisition of business in connection with our sale of a interest in rexair to strategic in march  we guaranteed rexair s million credit facility rexair guarantee 
this guarantee required us to maintain certain credit rating levels 
in response to a downgrade of our credit ratings in march  we obtained waivers of the ratings default from rexair s lenders while we pursued the re acquisition of rexair from strategic and the restructuring of our debt 
on august   we re acquired the equity interest in rexair previously sold to strategic 
the purchase consideration included the return to strategic of million in face value of strategic notes and the assumption of borrowings outstanding under rexair s million credit facility 
in connection with the re acquisition  we reduced our basis in rexair by our previously deferred gain of million and our previously recorded share of rexair s net liabilities of million and increased our basis by million in deferred transaction costs related to the original sale of rexair in march the allocation of the purchase consideration adjusted by the deferred gain  the carrying value of the retained liabilities and the deferred transaction costs to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed resulted in goodwill of million and other intangible assets of approximately million 
finite lived intangible assets include patented technology of million and a distributor network of million that 
table of contents are being amortized over their useful lives of years and years  respectively 
the balance of the intangible assets is related to a trade name  which is not being amortized 
the results of rexair have been included in the rexair segment from the date of re acquisition

in connection with the disposal plan we recorded a charge in fiscal of million  net of tax  which represents the difference between the historical net carrying value including allocated goodwill of million and the estimated net realizable value of these businesses 
each of these disposal plans qualified for treatment as discontinued operations 
the results of these discontinued businesses are excluded from our results from continuing operations for all periods presented 
they are  instead  included in our results from discontinued operations and are discussed separately below 
the assets and liabilities of these businesses are included in assets held for sale and liabilities associated with assets held for sale  respectively  for all periods presented through their respective sale date 
thus  included in these balances at september  are the assets and liabilities of our water systems business  and included in these balances at september  are the assets and liabilities of siteco and our swimming pools equipment  hearth and water systems businesses

we are subject to restrictions on the voting and disposition of these shares and have no involvement in the management or operations of the buyer

table of contents in october  we sold siteco  which was part of our lighting segment  for net proceeds of million 
siteco manufactures and distributes indoor and outdoor lighting fixtures for markets in europe 
in may  we sold our swimming pool equipment business  which was part of our previously defined bath plumbing segment  for million in cash and two notes from the buyer totaling million 
the first note  valued at million  is convertible at our option into  shares of the buyer s common stock anytime after march  and through the due date of march  the closing price of the note issuer s common stock on september  was per share

in june  we sold our hearth business  which was part of our previously defined bath plumbing segment  for million in cash 
in october  we sold our water systems business  which was part of our previously defined bath plumbing segment  for million in cash 
the estimated fiscal operating income of the businesses in the disposal plan were included in our expected loss on disposal of million  net of tax  which was recorded in fiscal and adjusted in fiscal in accordance with apb no 
the expected operating income of the businesses in the disposal plan was not included in our loss on disposal of million  net of tax 
instead  the results of operations were recorded as income loss from discontinued operations in the period in which they occurred in accordance with sfas no 
summarized results of the discontinued operations through the dates of sale are as follows for the fiscal years ended september  in millions net sales operating loss income the decrease in net sales and operating income loss from fiscal to fiscal is primarily the result of the lost contribution from the businesses sold in accordance with the disposal plan 
prior to their disposal dates  these businesses contributed million of net sales and million of operating income in fiscal  while only contributing million of net sales and an operating loss of million in fiscal net sales and operating income loss in fiscal also decreased  but to a lesser extent  because of the sale of the businesses in the disposal plan 
prior to their disposal dates  these businesses contributed million of net sales and million of operating income in fiscal  while only contributing million of net sales and an operating loss of million in fiscal included in operating income loss in fiscal are goodwill impairment charges of million 
in june  we evaluated the recoverability of the goodwill based on a fair value methodology  leading us to record the charge at that time 
excluding these impairment charges  the decrease in net sales and operating income loss from fiscal to fiscal primarily relates to the lost contribution from the businesses sold in accordance with the disposal plan 
with the completion of our and asset disposal programs  we have largely completed our transformation into an operating company 
we continue to explore strategic alternatives to improve our operating efficiencies 
for example  in the first half of fiscal  we combined six separate operating facilities into one new facility in chino  ca 
additionally  we have adopted a number of efficiency enhancing manufacturing techniques  including lean manufacturing techniques  to further improve our cost structure 
while we have experienced some initial inefficiency  we believe that this new facility will enhance our operations significantly 
we have also announced the closure of our manufacturing plants in plant city  fl and salem  oh 
the plant city plant  which manufactured spas  was closed in november their production demands were absorbed by our main spa facility located in chino  ca 
the salem plant  which manufactures cast iron sanitary ware  will not be replaced 
instead  the production will be 
table of contents outsourced to an overseas supplier at a lower cost to the overall operations 
these restructuring initiatives are discussed in more detail under impairment  restructuring and other charges 
while we have no specific plans at this time  we continue to evaluate strategies to improve the results of certain under performing product lines within our bath product segment 
we believe that there remains significant potential for further rationalization of our bath product segment s cost structure 
implementation of these strategies could result in our recording charges in future periods  including charges related to asset impairments 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash and cash equivalents  cash provided from operations and available borrowings under our existing credit facilities 
we expect to satisfy future operating needs through operating cash flow and borrowings under our new bank facilities see refinancing 
net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal and million for fiscal the difference between and was primarily due to the receipt of million of income tax refunds  net of tax payments  received in fiscal we also received million in fiscal from the sale of the technology license that had been the subject of patent litigation 
these favorable events were offset by payments in fiscal for retained liabilities associated with businesses sold in fiscal and the receipt of million of interest on the strategic notes in fiscal the decrease from fiscal to fiscal was primarily the result of an increase in international trade receivable balances  partially offset by an increase in operating income  largely due to a full year s contribution from the rexair business we re acquired in august credit terms for our international customers are generally longer than those provided to our domestic customers 
the percentage of international trade receivables represented of total trade receivables in fiscal compared to in fiscal we typically use cash in the first half of the fiscal year due to the seasonality of most of our businesses 
weather can significantly impact both residential and non residential construction and installation  which ultimately impacts sales in our bath products and plumbing products segments 
sales of outdoor jetted spas and other products are also sensitive to weather conditions and tend to decrease during the fall and winter months predominantly the first and second fiscal quarters 
in march  we entered into an agreement with lowe s to be its primary supplier of stocked jetted tub products 
this agreement resulted in increased sales of whirlpool bath and other products starting late in the third quarter of fiscal as a result of this agreement  approximately million was required to fund increased levels of working capital and to purchase in store displays 
additional store openings will require purchase of in store displays as part of our ongoing relationship with lowe s  however  we believe that this will have minimal impact on working capital in future years 
our relationships with homebase and focus in the uk require similar in store display commitments  but are not expected to have a significant impact on working capital in future years 
during fiscal  we paid approximately million related to our restructuring plans  and expect to pay approximately million in the next months see impairment  restructuring and other charges including million of charges to be incurred during fiscal during fiscal  we paid approximately million related to our restructuring plans 
net cash used by discontinued operations in fiscal was million as compared to net cash provided of million for fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in compared to fiscal was mainly due to the loss in contribution from lighting corporation of america  which provided million in cash in fiscal prior to its sale in april in addition  the swimming pool and equipment business was sold in may  before its cash generating season 
the decrease in cash provided by discontinued operations in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to the lost contribution from the businesses in the disposal plan  largely ames true temper in january and lighting corporation of america in april

during and  our board of directors authorized share repurchase programs aggregating million

in march  our board of directors indefinitely suspended the payment of dividends 
refinancing on july   we completed a comprehensive re financing of our corporate debt by closing on the new notes and bank facilities 
the net proceeds from the new notes  together with the initial borrowings under the bank facilities were used to repay the outstanding debt under our restructured facilities and fund the redemption of the old notes 
the restructured facilities were paid down simultaneously with the closing of the bank facilities and new notes  on july  funds required for the redemption of the old notes were placed into an 
table of contents escrow account on july  these funds  totaling million  were used for the redemption of the old notes on august  the amount deposited reflected the principal  accrued interest and redemption premium payable to the old note holders

the new notes  which are due july  and pay interest semiannually on january and july of each year  are subject to registration with the securities and exchange commission pursuant to a registration rights agreement 
under the five year asset based revolving credit facility  we can borrow up to million subject to a borrowing base consisting of eligible accounts receivable and eligible inventory  plus eligible trademarks 
the initial amount of eligible trademarks of million is being amortized evenly over the first two years of the facility as a reduction of the borrowing base 
the interest rate under the facility is currently over libor or over prime

the million term loan matures july  along with the asset based facility and carries an interest rate of over prime with a minimum rate of 
mandatory prepayments of million are required on the term loan annually beginning in september  which are amortized evenly over each twelve month period 
additional prepayments are required for asset sale proceeds as well as an annual prepayment equal to of our annual consolidated excess cash flow  as determined in the agreement 
prepayments under each of these circumstances would  in most cases  first be applied to the term loan facility 
we incurred approximately million in transaction and professional fees associated with the completion of the bank facilities deal 
these costs were capitalized and are being amortized over the five year term of the bank facilities 
the bank facilities require us to maintain certain consolidated fixed charged coverage  interest coverage and leverage ratios  comply with maximum annual capital expenditure limits and comply with other customary affirmative and negative covenants 
there are also several fees including an unused commitment fee of  a letter of credit fee equal to the applicable libor margin and a fronting fee of on all outstanding letters of credit

new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 

this statement provides alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
those methods include the prospective method  the modified prospective method or the retroactive restatement method 
the statement also amends accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 interim financial reporting  to require disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an entity s accounting policy decisions with respect to stock based employee compensation in interim financial information 
we do not plan to adopt sfas no 
under the guidelines set forth in sfas no 
to review the amounts that we would have recorded historically had we already adopted sfas no 
 see our stock based compensation disclosure in note to our consolidated financial statements 
past results  however  are not necessarily indicative of the results that should be expected for future years 
we cannot determine  with any accuracy  the effect the adoption of the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation would have on our future operating results since the amount to be recorded as compensation expense is dependent on a number of unknown variables including the number of options that will be granted during the year  the volatility of our stock in the future and the option price at the time of the grant 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation number  consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
this interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities 
under current practice  two enterprises generally have been included in consolidated financial statements because one enterprise controls the other through voting interests 
fin defines the concept of variable interests and requires existing unconsolidated variable interest entities to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the entities do not effectively disperse risks among the parties involved 
this interpretation applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january  it applies as of the end of the first fiscal year or interim period ending after december   to variable interest entities in which 
table of contents an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  the interpretation may be applied prospectively with a cumulative effect adjustment as of the date on which it is first applied or by restating previously issued financial statements for one or more years with a cumulative effect adjustment as of the beginning of the first year restated 
we have completed our assessment of the impact fin has on us immediately and have determined that we do not have an interest in any vie s established after january  we do not have any special purpose entities 
we are in the process of evaluating our interests to determine if they meet the characteristics of interests that would qualify as variable interest entities based on the interpretation 
in april  the fasb issued statement no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement amends and clarifies financial accounting and reporting for derivative instruments and for hedging activities under sfas no 
effective october   we adopted sfas no 
 as amended  which requires that all derivative instruments be reported on the balance sheet at fair value and establishes criteria for designation and effectiveness of hedging relationships 
the adoption of this new guidance did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
many of those instruments were previously classified as equity 
this statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  the adoption of this statement did not have an impact on our financial position or results of operations 
foreign currency matters the functional currency of each of our foreign operations is the local currency 
assets and liabilities of foreign subsidiaries are translated at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet dates  while net sales  expenses and cash flows are translated at average exchange rates for the period 
translation gains and losses are reported as a component of stockholders equity 
effects of inflation because of the relatively low level of inflation experienced in our principal markets  inflation did not have a material impact on our results of operations during the periods presented 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions  which are based upon historical experience and on various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
reported amounts and disclosures may have been different had management used different estimates and assumptions or if different conditions had occurred in the periods presented 
our accounting policies can be found in note to our consolidated financial statements 
below is a discussion of the policies that we believe may involve a high degree of judgment and complexity 
trade receivables we record an allowance for doubtful accounts  reducing our receivables balance to an amount we estimate is collectible from our customers 
we use significant judgment in estimating uncollectible amounts  considering numerous factors such as current overall economic conditions  industry specific 
table of contents economic conditions  historical and current customer performance and customer relationships 
although we consider our allowances for uncollectible accounts to be adequate and proper  changes in economic conditions or customer circumstances could have a material effect on the reserve balances required 
historically  actual results have not deviated significantly from those previously estimated by management 
inventories our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
we review our inventory balances to determine if inventories can be sold at amounts equal to or greater than their recorded values 
the review includes the identification of slow moving inventories  obsolete inventories and discontinued products based on the historical performance of the inventories and current operational plans for inventories  as well as estimated future customer demand for the inventories 
historically  actual results have not deviated significantly from those previously estimated by management 
deferred income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the tax effects  based on current law  of any temporary differences in the timing of when net sales and expenses are recognized for tax purposes and when they are recognized for financial statement purposes 
management reviews the deferred tax assets periodically for recoverability  and valuation allowances are provided as necessary 
we consider expected future income and gains from investments as well as tax planning strategies  including the potential sale of certain assets  in assessing the need for a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
if future taxable income is different than expected  we may need to change our valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 
assets held for sale and liabilities associated with assets held for sale we record reserves for the difference between the carrying value and the net realizable value of our net assets held for sale 
these reserves require that management make assumptions about estimated proceeds  based on the demand for these assets and current market conditions  and about estimated costs to sell  based on management s professional knowledge and experience 
we monitor these reserves on an on going basis and record adjustments to our estimates based on actual results and management s updated knowledge 
assets held for sale have been evaluated for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangibles we have significant intangible assets related to goodwill and other acquired intangibles 
the determination of related estimated useful lives and whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgment 
changes in strategy  reporting unit operating results and or market conditions could significantly impact our judgment and could require adjustments to recorded asset balances 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we test our goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at the reporting unit level annually in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year  or earlier in the year if indications of impairment arise 
we test our finite lived intangible assets for impairment when there are indicators of impairment as defined in sfas no 
the results of any of these tests could require adjustments to recorded asset balances in future periods 
costs associated with exit or disposal activities in establishing accruals for restructuring costs associated with exit or disposal activities  we measure our liability at fair value in the period in which the liability is incurred in accordance with sfas no 
in estimating the fair value of expected exit and disposal costs  we make certain assumptions to determine the remaining lease obligations  sublease income  severance costs  relocation costs and other exit costs 
while we feel our assumptions are appropriate  there can be no assurance that actual costs will not differ from estimates used to establish the restructuring reserves 
if actual results differ from our estimates  we may need to adjust  upward or downward  our restructuring reserves in the future 
additionally  long lived assets are evaluated for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
which involves the use of estimates to calculate fair value  future cash flows and costs to sell 
these estimates may differ from actual amounts realized in future periods 

table of contents commitments and contingencies we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to environmental  labor  product and other matters 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
we determine the amount of reserves needed  if any  for each individual issue based on our professional knowledge and experience and discussions with legal counsel 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter  the ultimate resolution of each matter or changes in approach  such as a change in settlement strategy  in dealing with these matters 
we have sold a number of assets and operating entities over the last several years and have  on occasion  provided indemnification for liabilities relating to product liability  environmental and other claims 
we have recorded reserves for claims related to these obligations when appropriate and  on certain occasions  have obtained the assistance of an independent actuary in the determination of those reserves 
if actual experience deviates from our estimates  we may need to record adjustments to these liabilities in future periods 
our insurance programs for worker s compensation  general liability  vehicle liability and employee related health care benefits are effectively self insured 
we record self insurance accruals based on our estimates of the fully developed cost of claims filed and claims incurred but not reported 
estimates of claims development and claims incurred but not reported are developed by us with the help of an independent actuary 
if actual experience of claims development is significantly different than our estimates  an adjustment to our self insurance accruals may need to be recorded in future periods 
warranty reserves are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets to reflect our contractual liabilities relating to warranty commitments to our customers 
we provide warranty coverage of various lengths and terms to our customers depending on standard offerings and negotiated contractual agreements 
we record an estimate for warranty expense at the time of sale based on historical warranty return rates and repair costs 
should future warranty experience differ materially from our historical experience  we may be required to record additional warranty reserves which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period in which these additional reserves are required 
pension and other post employment benefits we have significant pension and post retirement benefit income and expense and assets liabilities that are developed from actuarial valuations 
these valuations include key assumptions regarding discount rates  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates  merit and promotion increases and the current health care cost trend rate 
we consider current market conditions in selecting these assumptions 
changes in the related pension and post retirement benefit income costs or assets liabilities may occur in the future due to changes in the assumptions and changes in asset values 
when valuing the pension plans at september  we reduced our discount rate and maintained the same expected rate of return on assets as in the prior year 
this change in assumption  along with other factors  will reduce the amount of pension income recognized by approximately million in fiscal as compared to fiscal future changes in the assumptions underlying our pension valuations  including as a result of continued declines in equity markets and interest rates  could result in further reductions in pension income  which could negatively affect our consolidated results of operations in future periods 
we recognized million  million and million of pension income in fiscal  and  respectively 
these amounts increased our operating income by an equal amount for each of the respective periods 
the lower discount rate and increase in current healthcare costs are also expected to increase expenses by an equal amount related to other post employment benefits by approximately million in pension income  excluding service costs  related to our master plan is included in corporate expenses 
our master plan covers certain employees in our bath products segment  plumbing products segment and corporate offices  as well as certain employees in some of our legacy companies 
the service cost portion of pension income associated with our master plan is allocated to the operating 
table of contents segments and corporate based on employee data 
pension income or expense associated with our other benefit plans are recorded on the books of the business that employs the benefited employees and are not shared between operating segments 
environmental and asbestos liabilities we are investigating and remediating contamination at a number of present and former operating sites under cercla  rcra or comparable state statutes or agreements with third parties 
these proceedings are in various stages ranging from initial investigations to active settlement negotiations to the cleanup of sites 
we have been named as a potentially responsible party at a number of superfund sites under cercla or comparable state statutes 
under these statutes  responsibility for the entire cost of cleanup of a contaminated site can be imposed upon any current or former site owners or operator  or upon any party who sent waste to the site  regardless of the lawfulness of the original activities that led to the contamination 
no information currently available reasonably suggests that projected expenditures associated with any of these proceedings or any remediation of these sites will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in june  we acquired zurn  which itself owned various subsidiaries 
zurn is one of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
zurn  along with many other unrelated companies  is a co defendant in numerous asbestos related lawsuits pending in the us plaintiffs claims primarily allege personal injuries allegedly caused by exposure to asbestos used primarily in industrial boilers formerly manufactured by a segment of zurn that has been presented as a discontinued operation 
zurn did not manufacture asbestos or asbestos components but purchased it from other suppliers 
as of september   the number of asbestos claims pending against zurn was approximately  these  claims were included in approximately  lawsuits  in which zurn and an average of other companies are named as defendants  and in which cumulatively allege damages of approximately billion against all defendants 
asbestos claims pending against zurn as of september  and september  were approximately  and  respectively 
asbestos claims filed against zurn  and settled unfiled claims treated as if filed  for the years ended september   and were approximately   and  respectively 
since zurn received its first asbestos claim in the s  zurn has settled  agreed to settle or otherwise disposed of approximately  asbestos claims including dismissals of approximately  of such claims through september  during the fiscal year ended september  and as of such date  settlements paid and or pending payment amounted to approximately  claims and approximately  claims were dismissed and or pending dismissal 
during the fiscal year ended september  and as of such date  settlements paid and or pending payment amounted to approximately  claims including approximately  unfiled claims and approximately  claims were dismissed and or pending dismissal 
finally  during the fiscal year ended september  and as of such date  settlements paid and or pending payment amounted to approximately  claims and approximately  claims were dismissed and or pending dismissal 
zurn s insurers have paid or have agreed to pay all settlement costs relating to these claims 
defense costs are currently being paid by zurn s insurers without eroding the coverage amounts of its insurance policies  although a few policies that will be accessed in the future may count defense costs toward aggregate limits 
at september   zurn and its actuarial consultant estimated that its potential liability for asbestos claims pending against it and for claims estimated to be filed through is approximately million 
this accrual comprises i approximately million in claims that had been settled but unpaid as of september   ii approximately million in proposed settlements of pending and future claims  and iii approximately million for other future claims 
at september   it was estimated that zurn s potential liability for asbestos claims pending against it and for claims estimated to be filed through was approximately million 
this estimate was comprised of i million in claims that had been settled but unpaid as of september   ii million in proposed settlements of pending and future claims  and iii million for other future claims 
these estimates are based on the current and anticipated number of future asbestos claims  the timing and amounts of asbestos payments  the status of ongoing litigation and the potential impact of defense strategies and settlement 
table of contents initiatives 
however  there are inherent uncertainties involved in estimating both the number of future asbestos claims as well as future settlement costs  and the actual liability could exceed zurn s estimate due to changes in law and other factors beyond their control 
zurn s present estimate of its asbestos liability assumes i its recent vigorous defense strategy will enable it to reduce both its claim frequency and claim severity in the future  ii approximately  other future asbestos claims  and iii its insurers will continue to pay defense costs without eroding the coverage amounts of its insurance policies 
while zurn believes there is evidence  in recent claims settlements  for such an impact of a successful defense strategy  if the defense strategy ultimately is not successful  to the extent assumed by zurn  the severity and frequency of asbestos claims could increase substantially above zurn s estimates 
further  while zurn s current asbestos liability is based on an estimate of claims through  such liability may continue beyond  and such liability could be substantial 
zurn s analysis of its available insurance to cover its potential asbestos liability as of september  is approximately million 
this total includes the remaining limits of million in insurance coverage under certain excess policies which were a subject of a settlement of an action commenced by zurn in the us district court of the western district of pennsylvania which sought  among other things  a declaration that the insurance coverage limits of certain excess policies provided million in coverage 
as part of the settlement  zurn agreed to pay its insurer million over four years 
the first payment in the sum of million was paid in march  and we have secured the balance of the obligation with a letter of credit in the amount of million 
zurn believes  based on its experience in defending and dismissing such claims and the approximately million of insurance coverage available  that it has sufficient insurance to cover the pending and reasonably estimable future claims 
this conclusion was reached after considering zurn s experience in asbestos litigation  the insurance payments made to date by zurn s insurance carriers  existing insurance policies  the industry ratings of the insurers and the advice of insurance coverage counsel with respect to applicable insurance coverage law relating to the terms and conditions of those policies 
however  there is no assurance that this amount of insurance will ultimately be available or that zurn s asbestos liabilities will not ultimately exceed this amount 
factors that could cause a decrease in the amount of available coverage include insolvencies of one more of zurn s carriers  changes in law governing the policies and potential disputes with the carriers on the scope of coverage 
after review of the foregoing with zurn and its consultants  we believe that the resolution of zurn s pending and reasonably estimable asbestos claims will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of the arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and we have no remaining obligations  prices are fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
we make shipments to approved customers based on orders placed 
prices are fixed when the customer places the order 
an approved customer is one that has been subjected to our credit evaluation 
we record revenue when title passes  which is either at the time of shipment or upon delivery to the customer 
the passage of title is dependent on the arrangements made with each customer 
provisions are made for sales returns and allowances at the time of sale 
we use significant judgment in estimating sales return costs  considering numerous factors such as current overall and industry specific economic conditions and historical sales return rates 
although we consider our sales return reserves to be adequate and proper  changes in historical customer patterns could require adjustments to the reserves 
historically  however  actual results have not deviated significantly from those previously estimated by management 
we also record reductions to our revenues for customer and distributor programs and incentive offerings including special pricing agreements  promotions and other volume based incentives 
we may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time the incentive is offered 

table of contents accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  defines a fair value method of accounting for issuance of stock options and other equity instruments 
under the fair value method  compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the service period  which is usually the vesting period 
pursuant to sfas no 
 we are not required to adopt the fair value method of accounting for employee stock based transactions 
we are permitted to account for such transactions under apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  which defines an intrinsic value method of accounting for the issuance of stock options and other equity instruments  but are required to disclose in a note to our consolidated financial statements pro forma net income and per share amounts as if we had applied the methods prescribed by sfas no 
we apply apb opinion no 
and related interpretations in accounting for stock options granted to employees and non employee directors 
as a result  we have not recorded any compensation expense related to the issuance of stock options 
instead  we have complied with the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
except for non employee directors  we have not granted any options to non employees

discontinued operations effective october   we adopted sfas  no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which establishes a single accounting model for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  including discontinued operations 
sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
our disposal plan was accounted for in accordance with apb no 
 while our disposal plan was accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
both of these accounting standards contain criteria that must be met in order for businesses to be presented as discontinued operations 
in connection with our accounting for each of these disposal plans  we segregated the assets  liabilities and operations of the discontinued business 
the operations are presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations 
the assets and liabilities of these businesses are included in assets held for sale and liabilities associated with assets held for sale in the balance sheets 
in fiscal  we accrued for estimated losses during the disposal phase for businesses included in the disposal plan 
these estimates were updated as circumstances changed or as additional information became available such as the actual terms of the sales transactions 
revenues and expenses associated with businesses included in the disposal plan are included in operations when earned or incurred  respectively 
variable interest entities any potential variable interest entity vie created after january  in which we hold a variable interest must be assessed to determine whether the vie should be consolidated into our results based on criteria established by fin management s judgment  and in many cases  probability weighted projected cash flows are used in determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity and whether we are the primary beneficiary 
we have tested all potential vies created after january  under the fin criteria  and we believe that we do not hold any variable interests in any vies 
disclosure concerning forward looking statements and factors that may affect future results in december  the private securities litigation reform act of the act was enacted by the us congress 
the act  as amended  contains certain amendments to the securities act of and the securities exchange act of these amendments provide protection from liability in private lawsuits for forward looking statements made by public companies 
we take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the act 

table of contents our annual report on form k  including the letter of the chairman and chief executive officer included in the annual report to stockholders contains both historical information and other information that may be used to infer future performance 
examples of historical information include our annual financial statements and the commentary on past performance contained in the md a 
while we have specifically identified certain information as being forward looking in the context of its presentation  we caution the reader that  with the exception of information that is clearly historical  all the information contained in this annual report on form k and the letter of the chairman and chief executive officer included in the report to stockholders should be considered to be forward looking statements as referred to in the act 
without limitation  when it uses the words believe  estimate  plan  expect  intend  anticipate  continue  project  probably  should  and similar expressions  we intend to clearly express that the information deals with possible future events and is forward looking in nature 
forward looking information involves risks and uncertainties 
this information is based on various factors and assumptions about future events that may or may not actually come true 
as a result  our operations and financial results in the future could differ substantially from those discussed in the forward looking statements in this annual report and other documents that have been filed with the securities and exchange commission 
in particular  various economic and competitive factors  including those such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  inflation rates  instability in domestic and foreign financial markets  terrorist acts  consumer spending patterns  energy costs and availability  freight costs  availability of consumer and commercial credit  adverse weather  levels of residential and commercial construction and changes in raw material and component costs could cause our actual results in future years to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statement 
all subsequent written and oral forward looking statements attributable to jacuzzi brands  inc are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing factors 
the following are some of the factors we believe could cause our actual results to differ materially from expected and historical results 
other factors besides those listed here could also adversely affect results 
covenants of bank facilities the bank facilities contain various provisions that limit our management s discretion by restricting its ability to  among other things incur additional debt or enter into sale and lease back transactions  pay dividends or distributions on our capital stock or repurchase our capital stock  issue preferred stock of subsidiaries  make certain investments  create liens to secure debt  enter into transactions with affiliates  merge or consolidate with another company  and transfer and sell assets 
in addition  the bank facilities require that we meet specified financial ratios and tests 
these restrictions could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet extraordinary capital needs or otherwise restrict corporate activities 
if we were to fail to comply with the covenants and restrictions of the bank facilities  notes or any other subsequent financing agreements  a default could occur 
such a default could allow the lenders  if the agreements so provide  to accelerate the related debt as well as any other debt to which a cross acceleration or cross default provision applies 
in addition  the lenders could terminate any commitments they had made to supply us with further funds 

table of contents substantial indebtedness we are highly leveraged 
our high level of indebtedness could further interfere with our ability to operate our business 
for example  it could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limit our ability to obtain additional financing  require the dedication of a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal of  and interest on  our indebtedness  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry  and place us at a competitive disadvantage relative to less leveraged competitors 
our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to pay the principal of  and interest on  our indebtedness is uncertain 
in particular  we may not meet its anticipated revenue and operating expense targets  and as a result  its future debt service obligations could exceed the cash available to it 
significant customers we have certain customers that are very important to our business and the successful implementation of our business strategy 
some of our products are sold in very competitive markets 
our competitors may adopt more aggressive policies and devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products  which could result in a loss of customers 
the loss of one or more of these major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
prices of raw materials or finished goods we purchase most of the raw materials for our products on the open market  and rely on third parties for the sourcing of certain finished goods 
as such  cost of products sold may be affected by changes in the market price of raw materials or sourced finished goods 
we do not generally engage in commodity hedging transactions for raw materials 
significant increases in the prices of our products due to increases in the cost of raw materials or sourcing could have a negative effect on demand for our respective end products  or to the extent that we cannot pass such increases on to our customers  on its margins and profitability  as well as a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
interest rate sensitivity the interest rate relating to our senior secured notes  due in  is fixed at 
the interest rate related to the our term loan is based on a spread over prime and the interest rate related to our revolving line of credit is based on a spread over the libor 
a significant change in the prime rate or the libor rate could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
currently we are not utilizing any interest rate protection agreements to limit our exposure to this risk 
international operations we have significant operations outside the us also  certain of our domestic businesses generate significant revenue from export sales and certain businesses obtain a significant amount of finished goods from unaffiliated suppliers in east asia 
our international operations subject us to risks associated with operating in foreign countries  including fluctuations in currency exchange rates  unstable political and economic conditions  imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into dollars or remittance of dividends and other payments by foreign subsidiaries  imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments of foreign subsidiaries  hyperinflation in certain foreign countries and imposition or increase of investment and other restrictions by foreign governments 
no assurance can be given that such risks will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents product mix historically  our businesses have sold a wide range of products 
if the mix of products we sell shift to include a larger percentage of products with lower profit margins  earnings may be negatively affected 
environmental regulation our past and present business operations and our past and present ownership and operation of real property are subject to extensive and changing federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment  the handling and disposal of wastes including solid and hazardous wastes or otherwise relating to health  safety and protection of the environment 
as such  the nature of our operations and previous operations by others at real property owned by jacuzzi brands  inc expose us to the risk of claims under environmental  health and safety laws and regulations  and there can be no assurance that material costs or liabilities will not be incurred in connection with such claims 
based on our experience to date  we do not expect such claims or the costs of compliance with federal  state  local and foreign environmental  health and safety laws and regulations to have a material impact on its capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position 
no assurance can be given  however  that the discovery of presently unknown environmental conditions  changes in environmental  health and safety laws and regulations or their interpretation  or other unanticipated events will not give rise to expenditures or liabilities that may have such an effect 
seasonality our business segments experience seasonal business swings  which correspond to the north american seasons 
this seasonality requires that we manage our cash flows over the course of the year 
if sales were to fall substantially below what we would normally expect during certain periods  our annual financial results would be adversely impacted and our ability to service debt may also be adversely affected 
weather weather could adversely affect our business  financial condition and our results of operations 
adverse weather  such as unusually prolonged periods of cold or rain  blizzards  hurricanes and other severe weather patterns  could delay or halt construction activity 
for example  an unusually severe winter can lead to reduced construction activity and magnify the seasonal decline in our net sales and earnings during the winter months 
competition the markets in which we sell our products are highly competitive 
we compete against some international  national and many regional rivals  resulting in substantial pressure on our pricing and profit margins 
in addition  certain of our products from foreign manufacturers are subject to competition from other importers and could even be subject to competition from certain of our customers seeking to source directly from such foreign manufacturers 
as a result of pricing pressures  we may in the future experience reductions in profit margins 
we believe that our purchasing power  nationwide distribution network and marketing capabilities and our manufacturing efficiency allow us to competitively price our products 
we cannot assure you that it will be able to maintain or increase the current market share of our products successfully in the future 
demand for products many individuals who purchase our products depend on financing either by independent consumer finance companies or  to a lesser extent  by independent distributors in order to make purchases 
fluctuations in the prevailing interest rates could affect the availability of financing to our customers 
the unavailability of consumer credit could lead to a reduction in demand for our products and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents furthermore  demand in the building and home improvement product industries is influenced by new construction activity and the demand for replacement products as well as repairs remodeling activity 
there can be no assurance that we will maintain a balanced mix of new and repair remodel revenue within the bath products and plumbing products segments 
accordingly  the strength of the us economy including confidence in the us economy by our customers  the strength of the residential and commercial real estate markets  institutional building activity  the age of existing housing stock  job growth and interest rates have a direct impact on us 
threat or actual break out of hostilities and acts of war or terrorism involving the us could also negatively impact construction  repair or remodeling activity 
any declines in new housing or commercial construction starts or demand for replacement building and home improvement products may adversely impact our operation and there can be no assurance that any such adverse effects would not be material and would not continue for an indeterminate period of time 
increase in size and market power of distributors we believe that there is a trend among our distributors to increase in size and market power 
if this trend continues  they may be able to exert pressure on us to reduce prices and create price competition 
any resulting price competition may adversely affect our sales and profit margins 
business strategy our ability to implement our business strategy successfully is dependent upon a number of factors including competition  availability of working capital and general economic conditions 
significant elements of the business strategy include growth of market share and introduction of related and new products 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to implement our strategy or be able to obtain financing for such strategy on acceptable terms 
the indentures governing the senior secured credit facilities and senior notes will substantially limit our ability to incur additional debt to finance our strategy 
in addition  the failure to implement our business strategy successfully may adversely affect our ability in the future to service our debt 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements other than those disclosed under commitments 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of doing business  we are exposed to the risks associated with changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
to limit the risks from such fluctuations  we may enter into various hedging transactions that have been authorized pursuant to our policies  but we do not engage in such transactions for trading purposes 
to manage exposure to interest rate movements  we have used interest rate protection agreements 
however  as of september   we do not have any such agreements outstanding 
based on our overall exposure to interest rate changes  a hypothetical increase of basis points across all maturities of our floating rate debt obligations would decrease our estimated pre tax earnings in fiscal by million  compared to a million decrease in fiscal pre tax earnings had libor rates been basis points higher 
net payments under swap agreements amounted to approximately million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
there were no swap agreements outstanding during any portion of fiscal the prior year swaps were of notional amounts and maturities that related to specific portions of outstanding debt  and accordingly  were accounted for as hedge transactions 
we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to our international operations as well as our us businesses  which import or export goods 
we have made limited use of financial instruments to manage this risk and have no such instruments outstanding as of september hypothetical unfavorable movements of across each of the foreign exchange rates that we have exposure would have decreased our estimated income from continuing operations by approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in 
table of contents the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  which are a changed dollar value of the resulting sales  changes in exchange rates also affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive 
our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices
