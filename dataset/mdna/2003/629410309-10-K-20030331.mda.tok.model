item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation general the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements provided under part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to deferred costs and revenues  depreciation of broadcast equipment and other fixed assets  bad debts  investments  intangible assets  financing operations  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
o we record deferred costs and revenues related to the costs and related installation revenue associated with installing new customer sites 
based on staff accounting bulletin sab  we amortize these amounts over an estimated three year average life of a customer relationship 
if a significant number of our customers leave us before the estimated life of each customer is attained  amortization of those deferred costs and revenues would accelerate  which would result in net incremental revenue 
o we incur a relatively significant level of depreciation expense in relationship to our operating income 
the amount of depreciation expense in any fiscal year is largely related to the estimated life of handheld  wireless playmaker devices and computers located at our customer sites 
the playmakers are depreciated over a four year life and the computers over a three year life 
the estimated life of these assets was determined based upon anticipated technology changes 
if our playmakers and servers turn out to have a longer life  on average  than estimated  our depreciation expense would be significantly reduced in those future periods 
conversely  if the playmakers and servers turn out to have a shorter life  on average  than estimated  our depreciation expense would be significantly increased in those future periods 
o we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the allowance is determined based on reserving for all customers that have terminated our service and all accounts over days past due  plus five percent of outstanding balances for all unreserved customer balances 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we do not have any of the following o off balance sheet arrangements  o certain trading activities that include non exchange traded contracts accounted for at fair value or speculative or hedging instruments  or o relationships and transactions with persons or entities that derive benefits from any non independent relationship other than the related party transactions discussed in item certain relationships and related transactions or which are so non material to fall below the materiality threshold of such item 
background our business is developing and distributing interactive entertainment and wireless information and communications products 
we operate our business principally through two operating units the ntn network and buzztime 
the ntn network provides interactive communications and entertainment products and services to the hospitality industry  including premiere casual dining restaurants  sports bars  taverns  hotels  cruise ships and active adult communities 
the ntn network also includes our sales of wireless paging and member services products to restaurants and other hospitality locations

interest income and expense interest income decreased  or  to  in  compared to  in  due to less cash on hand from capital raised in previous years 
interest expense decreased  or  to  in  compared to  in  due to the expiration of various capitalized leases as well as to a lower average balance on our revolving line of credit 
minority interest minority interest in loss of consolidated subsidiary increased  or to  in compared to  in the minority interest figure represented a full year s allocation of six percent of buzztime s losses while the figure represents an allocation of six percent of buzztime s losses for only the second half of as we received the minority interest investment in buzztime by scientific atlanta  inc at the end of june income taxes the ntn network has taxable income for the year ended december  for federal income tax reporting purposes and in unitary states where the ntn network may file on a combined basis  taxable losses incurred by buzztime should be sufficient to offset ntn network s taxable income 
in states where separate filing is required  ntn network will likely incur a state tax liability 
as a result  ntn network recorded a state tax provision of  in year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  operations for resulted in a net loss of  compared to net loss of  for the operating results for included non cash debt conversion costs of  related to the conversion of  on the convertible senior subordinated notes

other revenue decreased to  in from  in operating expenses direct operating costs of services decreased  or  to  in from  in this is primarily due to a decrease in depreciation and amortization of approximately  due to our dos based network equipment being fully depreciated by june that decrease was partially offset by an increase in depreciation for capitalized broadcast equipment associated with the digital network 
communication charges decreased by approximately  due to technical changes made in and a change in vendors during the second half of freight expenses decreased by approximately  due to less installations of the digital equipment and less incoming shipments of playmakers in advertising and network commissions also decreased approximately  partially as a result of our decision to transition advertising sales in house

com and internet game station assets  license and related goodwill on the basis that the assets are not recoverable through future cash flows 
research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased  or  to  in from  in the current period expenses resulted from our research and development efforts related to the digital network and interactive television initiatives 
we currently recognize as research and development expense only payments to outside providers and  as a result  any research and development work by our employees fell into general and administrative expenses 
over the past two years  we have hired several of the consultants who previously conducted research and development activities as well as adding to the information technology group 
we believe that our information technology department  in fact  has increased our true overall level of development activity in over in  our research and development efforts related to the digital network and internet initiatives 
this  decrease in was largely due to the cessation of the internet initiatives in late interest expense interest expense decreased  or  to  in  compared to  in  due to the expiration of various capital leases  the decrease in the interest rate on our convertible senior subordinated notes from to during the period january through november and to lower outstanding balances on our line of credit in ebitda our earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda increased by  to  for the year ended december  from ebitda of  for the year ended december  ebitda is not intended to represent a measure of performance in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals gaap 
nor should ebitda be considered as an alternative to statements of cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
ebitda is included herein because we believe that financial analysts  lenders  investors and other interested parties find it to be a useful tool for measuring the performance of companies that carry significant levels of non cash depreciation and amortization charges in comparison to their gaap earnings 
for example  our credit line carries certain financial covenants that are based upon our ebitda 
the following table reconciles our net loss per gaap to ebitda year ended december ebitda calculation net income loss    interest expense net    depreciation and amortization    provision for income taxes  ebitda    on a segment basis  our two segments generated ebitda levels as presented below year ended december  ebitda calculation network buzztime total net income loss    interest expense net   depreciation and amortization    provision for income taxes   ebitda    year ended december  ebitda calculation network buzztime total net loss    interest expense net    depreciation and amortization    income taxes ebitda    year ended december  ebitda calculation network buzztime total net loss    interest expense net    depreciation and amortization    income taxes ebitda    liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of  and working capital current assets in excess of current liabilities of  compared to cash and cash equivalents of  and working capital of  at december  net cash provided by operations was  in and  in our net loss from operations was more than offset by depreciation  amortization and other non cash charges in both years 
net cash used in investing activities was  in and  in included in net cash used in investing activities in were approximately  in capital expenditures  software and web site development and  of professional fees related to the acquisitions  which were partially offset by a reduction in deposits on equipment of  net cash used in financing activities was  in and  in the cash used in financing activities in included  of principal payments on capital leases  and  of net payments on the revolving line of credit 
the net cash used in financing activities was partially offset by  of proceeds from the exercise of stock options and warrants 
contractual cash obligations a table recapping our contractual cash obligations is presented below payments due by period contractual obligation less than year years years total revolving line of credit    capital lease obligations     purchase commitments     operating leases     total     the convertible senior subordinated notes are not included in the table as they were converted into ntn common stock at february  convertible senior subordinated notes as of december   we had outstanding convertible senior subordinated notes of  payable february  and bearing interest at per year 
the notes permitted us to convert up to the full principal amount into shares of our common stock at maturity at a conversion price of per share 
the convertible senior subordinated notes were originally issued in january for a principal amount of  and carried an interest rate of in exchange for our outstanding convertible senior subordinated notes of  payable on february  effective on december   we agreed to permit the holders of the notes to convert  of the outstanding principal amount into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share in order to increase our stockholder equity 
as a result  the holders received an aggregate amount of  shares of our common stock 
in connection with the conversion  we agreed to increase the interest rate on the remaining outstanding principal of the convertible notes was increased to from per year 
on february   the remaining  of convertible senior subordinated notes converted into  shares of our common stock based on the agreed conversion price of per share 
revolving line of credit in august  we entered into an agreement with coast business credit coast for a revolving line of credit not to exceed  interest is charged on the outstanding balance at a rate equal to the prime rate plus per annum  but cannot be less than per annum 
the line of credit is secured by substantially all of our assets 
total loan fees of  were payable in three annual installments and are being amortized over the life of the loan  which originally matured on august  our revolving line of credit agreement with coast was amended in may the line of credit provides for borrowings not to exceed the lesser of i a designated maximum amount  ii three times trailing monthly collections  or iii three times annualized trailing adjusted ebitda 
the amendment called for a gradual reduction in the line from  on april  to  on december  we completed that pay down process on december  the amendment to our revolving line of credit in may also allowed equity raised by us to be added to the ebitda calculation and permit us to exclude the effect of sab for the may amendment also required us to raise  in equity by june   maintain a minimum cash level of  each month and limited our cash burn to not more than  from april  onward without receiving additional equity 
the maturity date on the line of credit was also moved forward by two months to june  as part of the may amendment 
the investment in buzztime by an affiliate of scientific atlanta in june satisfied the  equity requirement 
on february   we amended our revolving line of credit to extend the expiration date of the revolving line of credit to june  the amendment also requires further line reductions of  each on june   january   and on march  the amendment deleted our minimum tangible effective net worth financial covenant and replaced it with two cash flow oriented covenants 
in return for the extension  coast received a loan fee of  on july  there were no changes to the interest rate in this amendment 
on february   we amended our revolving line of credit to extend the maturity date on the line of credit to june  the amendment also struck the previously scheduled march   paydown on the line of credit  deleted the trailing cash flow multiplier element of the borrowing base and modified the cash flow oriented covenants 
we agreed to pay coast a renewal fee of  on july  in association with this amendment 
there were no changes to the interest rate in this amendment 
on february   coast and its parent company  southern pacific bank  were seized by the federal deposit insurance corporation the fdic 
the fdic is currently acting as a trustee for coast and is in the process of selling off coast s loan portfolio to other lending institutions 
it is likely that the line of credit will be sold to another lender by the fdic 
however  should the fdic either cease funding or materially reduce the credit available to us despite the terms of the loan and security agreement  it would have a significant impact on our liquidity 
investment in buzztime on june   an affiliate of scientific atlanta invested  in buzztime for  shares of its preferred stock  representing of buzztime s capitalization on an as converted basis  and warrants to obtain an additional  shares of its preferred stock 
each share of buzztime preferred stock was initially convertible into one share of buzztime common stock and entitled to a non cumulative dividend of  if  and when as declared by buzztime s board of directors 
the exercise price of the scientific atlanta preferred stock purchase warrants is per share 
however  the warrants vest in increments only as cable system operators sign on by executing a distribution agreement for the buzztime channel 
in connection with the investment  buzztime entered into a development  license and marketing agreement with scientific atlanta to co develop an application to enable operation of a buzztime interactive trivia game show channel on scientific atlanta s explorer digital interactive set top network for distribution by cable operators to their subscribers 
the  in net proceeds may only be used towards development of the application for scientific atlanta and fulfillment of buzztime s obligations under the development agreement 
we granted scientific atlanta the right to exchange its shares of buzztime preferred stock into shares of ntn common stock if i buzztime did not obtain additional equity financing of  before june   ii the liquidation  dissolution or bankruptcy of buzztime before june   iii the failure of buzztime to conduct a qualified public offering by june   or iv a change in control of buzztime before june  on january   scientific atlanta converted its shares of buzztime preferred stock into our common stock at a conversion price of per share 
future financing needs our requirements for additional financing in will depend upon the growth of our two business segments 
in a low growth scenario for example  net site growth of sites in the ntn network and a couple of commercial trials of the buzztime trivia channel  utilization of our existing line of credit is expected to be sufficient to cover our financing requirements 
if we face more rapid growth in either or both segments  then we will require additional financing in if we are unsuccessful in obtaining financing  some initiatives relating to those higher growth opportunities may have to be curtailed or deferred 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us or at all 
in addition  our line of credit matures on june our liquidity and capital resources remain limited and this may constrain our ability to operate and grow our business 
in  we generated free cash flow defined as ebitda less cash interest expense  cash used in investing activities and cash used in financing activities of  which has covered our business requirements over that period 
we are also considering adding to our product line certain other wireless applications that are relevant to the hospitality industry 
we may add these incremental hospitality products through reseller arrangements or through acquisition 
our limited capital resources may prevent us from making such product additions or acquisitions on a cash basis 
we expect the level of expenditures in buzztime to rise over as we have entered the deployment phase with suscom and continue in the testing phase with certain other cable operators 
however  subject to any unexpected changes in our business that may occur as a result of a continued economic slowdown  and unless we incur unanticipated expenses  we believe we will continue generating adequate cash from the operation of the ntn network which  when combined with cash resources on hand and our line of credit  will allow us to continue to fund buzztime at least through december at current operational levels assuming that buzztime remains in the testing phase with certain cable operators for the remainder of the year 
if current buzztime channel sales efforts to major cable system operators the largest cable system operators in the united states succeed as planned and we enter into field trials with those cable operators  management intends to aggressively increase buzztime sales and marketing efforts late in the year to more quickly advance its distribution within the us market  which will require additional capital 
we believe that buzztime s success in entering into those field trials with major cable system operators may enhance our ability to raise additional capital at favorable pricing although there can be no assurance that will happen 
based upon current sales targets of achieving commercial deployment of the buzztime channel with several major cable system operators over the next several quarters  we anticipate that buzztime will require an additional  in financing per quarter commencing with the third quarter of the timing of this capital requirement is largely dependent on the timing of the commercial deployment 
the sooner we achieve commercial deployment  the sooner this capital requirement would arise 
if additional financing is not obtained  our accelerated growth plans may have to be deferred 
if cash generated by the ntn network is insufficient to cover buzztime s expenses and if additional financing for buzztime is not obtained and we cannot reduce cash expenditures at buzztime to a sufficient level  we may not be able to sustain the operations of buzztime beyond december in  the american stock exchange amex adopted several new listing standards 
one new standard was established for listed companies that had at least five consecutive years of losses as we do 
this new standard requires that such companies must maintain shareholders equity of at least million 
we submitted a plan to amex to achieve compliance with that standard  which they approved with the understanding that such compliance would be demonstrated on or about mid november  that plan was to increase our shareholders equity through a combination of conversion of existing equity like instruments on our balance sheet and by raising additional equity 
both of the equity like instruments on our balance sheet recently were converted into equity 
scientific atlanta s s a investment in buzztime preferred shares converted to our common stock on january  at a conversion price of per share 
the s a conversion increased our shareholders equity by approximately  on february   the million principal balance of our outstanding convertible senior subordinated notes converted to our common stock at the preagreed conversion price of per share and the conversion increased our shareholders equity by million 
on january   we issued and sold  shares of restricted common stock along with fully vested warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at per share  exercisable through january  through a private offering to robert m 
bennett  one of our directors  at a price per share of for an aggregate amount of million no commissions or placement agent fees were paid in connection with the offering 
we agreed to file a registration statement covering the resale of the shares of common stock including those shares underlying the warrants issued in both the s a conversion and in the bennett investment within days 
the combination of the above conversions and the bennett investment with our december  shareholders equity position of million yields a sum of million 
while these recent events have occurred on dates outside of the timeframe allowed under our plan with amex  the amex staff has continued to monitor our financial performance and outcome of our equity raising efforts and has allowed us to continue our listing on an exception basis 
we remain in discussion with several strategic and financial investors that we have contacted through investment banking firms 
we also have considered several acquisitions for stock which would additionally bring us into compliance 
from our informal discussions with the amex listings qualifications department  we believe that if we do not exercise our options and fail to achieve compliance with the new million net worth standard within approximately one month of filing this document  we will likely enter into a process of letters and hearings regarding our continued listing 
we believe that process will take several months 
we continue to believe that we will be able to raise the additional equity capital or make an acquisition to comply with our plan with amex during the extended time period afforded by the amex hearing process 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional equity financing on terms favorable to us or at all 
the ntn network has transmitted its data through the fm satellite platform for more than ten years 
that arrangement is scheduled to end in february we have entered into equipment purchase and satellite service agreements to convert the ntn network to a much higher speed  two way vsat satellite technology over the two year period ending february these agreements are with the same reseller of satellite services that provided the fm satellite platform to us 
this anticipated conversion to a two way satellite technology will be a significant use of capital resources 
we believe that the conversion of customer locations may require incremental capital expenditures of to million and increased cash operating expenses including estimated installation costs of to million over the two year conversion period 
we believe that the cost of installing and operating the two way satellite network will be offset both through expense reductions and by revenue enhancements following the two year conversion period 
during the two year conversion period  we believe that this conversion will have a moderately adverse impact on our earnings in addition to the use of capital involved 
in the longer term  we believe that this conversion will increase our earnings potential 
recent accounting pronouncements in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
statement updates  clarifies and simplifies existing accounting pronouncements including rescinding statement no 
 which required all gains and losses from extinguishment of debt to be aggregated and  if material  classified as an extraordinary item  net of related income tax effect and amending statement no 
to require that certain lease modifications that have economic effects similar to sale leaseback transactions be accounted for in the same manner as sale leaseback transactions 
statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after may   with early adoption of the provisions related to the rescission of statement no 
encouraged 
we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas no 
 which addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
nullifies eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the principal difference between sfas no 
and issue no 
relates to the recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity 
sfas no 
requires that a liability be recognized for those costs only when the liability is incurred  that is  when it meets the definition of a liability in the fasb s conceptual framework 
in contrast  under issue no 
 a company recognized a liability for an exit cost when it committed to an exit plan 
sfas no 
also establishes fair value as the objective for initial measurement of liabilities related to exit or disposal activities 
the statement is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  although earlier application is encouraged 
we are unable to determine the impact on our financial position or results of operations from the adoption of this statement 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness to others  an interpretation of fasb statements no

this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees issued 
the interpretation also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of the interpretation are applicable to guarantees issued or modified after december  and are not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements 
the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim and annual periods ending after december  we have adopted the disclosure requirements of this interpretation 
to date  we have not entered into any guarantees 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
this statement amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of statement no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements 
certain of the disclosure modifications are required for fiscal years ending after december  and are included in the notes to these consolidated financial statements 
we have adopted the annual disclosure provision in our december  financial statements and will adopt the interim provisions in the first quarter of in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
this interpretation addresses the consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities as defined in the interpretation 
the interpretation applies immediately to variable interests in variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interests in variable interest entities obtained after january  the application of this interpretation is not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements 
the interpretation requires certain disclosures in financial statements issued after january  if it is reasonably possible that we will consolidate or disclose information about variable interest entities when the interpretation becomes effective 
risk factors risk factors that may affect future results our business  results of operation and financial condition could be adversely affected by a number of factors  including the following we have experienced significant losses and we expect to incur significant net losses in the future 
we have a history of significant losses  including net losses of  in   in  and  in and an accumulated deficit of  as of december  we expect to incur significant operating and net losses for the next four quarters due primarily to our continued development of buzztime 
furthermore  we may never achieve profitability  and even if we do  we may not sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
our limited liquidity and capital resources may constrain our ability to operate and grow our business 
at december   our current assets exceeded our current liabilities by approximately  our liquidity and capital resources remain limited and this may constrain our ability to operate and grow our business 
we currently have a revolving line of credit agreement with coast business credit  which provides for borrowings of up to  and which expires on june  our availability under the line of credit may be reduced if our monthly collections fall below certain levels 
as of february   the maximum amount of  was available to us and approximately  was outstanding under the line of credit 
the line of credit is secured by substantially all of our assets 
any reduction in availability under our line of credit may further constrain our liquidity 
on february   coast and its parent company  southern pacific bank  were seized by the federal deposit insurance corporation the fdic 
the fdic is currently acting as a trustee for coast and is in the process of selling off coast s loan portfolio to other lending institutions 
should the fdic either cease funding us or materially reduce the credit availability to us under the terms of the line of credit  our liquidity would be significantly impacted in a negative way 
we will require additional financing to implement our plan to significantly expand the ditv network  including the planned two way satellite rollout  and to develop buzztime into a leading content provider for interactive television platforms 
our requirements for additional financing in will depend upon the growth of our two business segments 
in a low growth scenario for example  net site growth of sites in the ntn network and a number of commercial trials of the buzztime initiative  utilization of our line of credit is expected to be sufficient to cover our financing requirements 
if we face more rapid growth in either or both segments  then we will require additional financing in if we are unsuccessful in obtaining financing  some initiatives relating to those higher growth opportunities may have to be curtailed or deferred 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us or at all 
if we receive additional equity financing  it could be dilutive to our stockholders 
any debt financing  if available  may involve covenants limiting or restricting our operations or future opportunities 
new products and rapid technological change may render our operations obsolete or noncompetitive 
if we do not compete successfully in the development of new products and keep pace with rapid technological change  we will be unable to achieve profitability or sustain a meaningful market position 
the interactive entertainment and game industry is becoming highly competitive and subject to rapid technological changes when compared to other industries 
we are aware of other companies that are introducing interactive game products on interactive platforms that allow players to compete across the nation 
some of these companies may have substantially greater financial resources and organizational capital than we do  which could allow them to identify emerging trends 
in addition  changes in customer tastes may render our network  its content and our technology obsolete or noncompetitive 
the emergence of new entertainment products and technologies  changes in consumer preferences and other factors may limit the life cycle of our technologies and any future products and services we develop 
accordingly  our future performance will depend on our ability to o identify emerging technological trends in our market  o identify changing consumer needs  desires or tastes  o develop and maintain competitive technology  including new product and service offerings  o improve the performance  features and reliability of our products and services  particularly in response to technological changes and competitive offerings  and o bring technology to the market quickly at cost effective prices 
we may not be successful in developing and marketing new products and services that respond to technological and competitive developments and changing customer needs 
such products and services may not gain market acceptance 
any significant delay or failure in developing new or enhanced technology  including new product and service offerings  could result in a loss of actual or potential market share and a decrease in revenues 
if we fail to manage our growth effectively  we may lose business and experience reduced profitability 
continued implementation of our business plan requires an effective planning and management process 
our anticipated future growth will continue to place a significant strain on our management systems and resources 
if we are to grow successfully  we must o improve our operational  administrative and financial systems  o expand  train and manage our workforce  and o attract and retain qualified management and technical personnel 
the interactive gaming and entertainment industry is highly competitive 
the entertainment business is highly competitive 
we compete with other companies for total entertainment related revenues in the marketplace 
our network programming competes generally with broadcast television  direct satellite programming  pay per view  other content offered on cable television  and other forms of entertainment 
furthermore  certain of our competitors have greater financial and other resources available to them 
with the entrance of motion picture  cable and television companies  competition in the interactive entertainment and multimedia industries will likely intensify in the future 
in january  the walt disney company introduced interactive programming broadcast in conjunction with live sporting and other events  which competes directly with our programming 
we do not know of any direct impact on our operations to date 
we also compete with other content and services available to consumers through online services 
the expanded use of online networks and the internet provide computer users with an increasing number of alternatives to video games and entertainment software 
with this increasing competition and rapidly changing factors  we must be able to compete on technology  content and management strategy 
if we fail to provide the quality services and products  we will lose revenues to other competitors in the entertainment industry 
increased competition may also result in price reductions  fewer customer orders  reduced gross margins  longer sales cycles  reduced revenues and loss of market share 
if our intellectual property does not adequately protect our proprietary rights and intellectual property  our business could be seriously damaged 
we rely on a combination of trademarks  copyrights and trade secret laws to protect our proprietary rights in some of our products 
furthermore  it is our policy that all employees and consultants involved in research and development activities sign nondisclosure agreements 
our competitors may  however  misappropriate our technology or independently develop technologies that are as good as or better than ours 
our competitors may also challenge or circumvent our proprietary rights 
if we have to initiate or defend against an infringement claim in the future to protect our proprietary rights  the litigation over such claims could be time consuming and costly to us  adversely affecting our financial condition 
from time to time  we hire or retain employees or external consultants who may work for other companies developing products similar to those offered by us 
these former employers may claim that our products are based on their products and that we have misappropriated their intellectual property 
any such litigation could prevent us from exploiting our patent portfolio and cause us to incur substantial costs  which in turn could materially adversely affect our business 
we may be liable for the content we make available on the internet 
we make content available on our web sites and on the web sites of our advertisers and distribution partners 
the availability of this content could result in claims against us based on a variety of theories  including defamation  obscenity  negligence or copyright or trademark infringement 
we could also be exposed to liability for third party content accessed through the links from our web sites to other web sites 
we may incur costs to defend ourselves against even baseless claims  and our financial condition could be materially adversely affected if we are found liable for information that we make available 
implementing measures to reduce our exposure may require us to spend substantial resources and may limit the attractiveness of our services to users 
we may face exposure on sales and or use taxes in various states 
over the past several years  state tax authorities have made inquiries as to whether or not our services might require the collection of sales and use taxes from customers in those states 
we evaluate such inquiries on a case by case basis and have favorably resolved these tax issues in the past without any material adverse consequences 
however  in the current difficult economic climate  many states are expanding their interpretation of their sales and use tax statutes to derive additional revenue 
while in the past our sales and use tax expenses have not been material  it is likely that such expenses will grow in the future 
our games and game shows are subject to gaming regulations 
we operate online games of skill and chance that  in some instance  reward prizes 
these games are regulated in many jurisdictions 
the selection of prizewinners is sometimes based on chance  although none of our games require any form of monetary payment 
the laws and regulations that govern these games  however  are subject to differing interpretations in each jurisdiction and are subject to legislative and regulatory change in any of the jurisdictions in which we offer our games 
if such changes were to happen  we may find it necessary to eliminate  modify or cancel certain components of our products that could result in additional development costs and or the possible loss of revenue 
we are currently involved in litigation matters that could materially impact our profitability 
we are involved in two pending lawsuits in canada  both involving interactive network  inc both ntn and interactive network have asserted claims involving patent infringement and validity and certain other proprietary rights 
in february  interactive network deposited  in canadian dollars with the canadian court in compliance with the court s november  order  as additional security for costs to be incurred by us in defense of the action  in addition to  in canadian dollars posted in november and the  in canadian dollars posted on june  these actions relate only to the broadcast of the ntn network to subscribers of our canadian licensee and do not extend to our network operations in the united states or elsewhere 
on march   long range systems  inc filed in the united states district court  northern district of texas  a patent infringement complaint against our ntn wireless subsidiary 
this complaint alleged trade dress and patent infringement and unfair competition 
we were served with this complaint on march  this complaint relates to our repair and replacement activities of lrs pagers  which is not a significant percentage of our ntn wireless business 
at this early stage  we do not believe that this matter represents a significant level of exposure  however  we continue to review the complaint 
we intend to defend this action vigorously 
the foregoing claims may not be decided in our favor and we are not insured against claims made 
during the pendency of these claims  we will continue to incur the costs of our legal defense 
if our chief executive officer leaves us  our business may be adversely affected 
our success greatly depends on the efforts of our chief executive officer  stanley b 
kinsey 
our ability to operate successfully will depend significantly on his services and contributions 
mr 
kinsey s employment agreement with ntn was originally set to expire on october  and was extended through december  he is presently an at will employee 
the compensation committee of our board of directors is presently negotiating with mr 
kinsey the terms and conditions of an extension of his employment contract 
our business and operations may be adversely affected if he were to leave 
risks factors associated with the ntn network our canadian licensee has not yet converted to our new digital network 
our canadian licensee to date has declined to convert its hospitality customers to our new digital network and  as a result  remains on our old dos network 
we now have converted all but of our domestic hospitality sites to our new digital network and we intend to discontinue our old dos network in december if our canadian licensee continues to refuse to convert to our new digital network through the time we discontinue our dos network in june  this will materially negatively impact their business and  therefore  our licensing revenue may decline significantly as well 
we depend on a single supplier of playmakers r 
we currently purchase our megahertz playmakers from climax technology co 
ltd  an unaffiliated taiwanese manufacturer 
we are currently soliciting bids for the manufacture of our playmakers 
unless and until we succeed in establishing additional manufacturing relationships  we will continue to depend on our current sole source supplier of playmakers 
if we lose our supplier  our growth may be slowed until an alternative supplier is identified 
communication failures with our subscriber locations could result in the cancellation of subscribers and a decrease in our revenues 
we rely on both satellite and telephone systems to communicate with our subscriber locations 
we transmit our data to our hospitality customer sites via panamsat s galaxy iiir giiir satellite 
interruption in communications with our subscriber locations under either system could decrease customer loyalty and satisfaction and result in a cancellation of our services 
we are continually reviewing alternative telephone service providers and establishing contingency plans  however  such alternative providers and contingency plans have not been finalized 
in the event that we were forced to switch to another satellite  we would incur significant costs associated with re pointing its satellite receivers 
in addition  we could experience higher operating costs to transmit data to our customers via telephone lines and the internet during the transition period 
another potential risk  as our country is at war  is the possibility that our government could pre empt our satellite for national security reasons  as the united states satellite operators are federally licensed 
this would appear to be unlikely as our government has a strong communications infrastructure in place domestically 
also  it is likely the satellite would not be at risk of being damaged by any of the physical aspects of the war due to the fact that the satellite orbits over  miles above the earth 
we may sell equity interests in buzztime to third parties  which could result in the loss of control of buzztime or devaluation of our equity interest in buzztime 
in june  we sold a interest in buzztime to an affiliate of scientific atlanta  a leading cable television set top box manufacturer 
while scientific atlanta s investment position was converted to our common stock in january  we believe there may be divergent investment preferences between the strategies pursued by the ntn network and buzztime and may decide in the future to continue to raise additional financing by issuing and selling equity interests in buzztime to third parties 
to enhance the ability of buzztime to raise such financing  we have previously contributed and may contribute in the future some of our assets to buzztime in order to allow the development of a distinct identity that we believe is necessary for it to effectively grow as a separate concern 
these assets include our extensive trivia game show library and our interactive play along sports games and related intangible assets 
from an operational standpoint  we could lose control in buzztime 
if we lose control  buzztime may no longer provide adequate support and resources for content and programming for the ntn network  affecting the ability of the ntn network to continue its operations 
from a financial viewpoint  we could undervalue the stock of buzztime when selling it to third parties or undervalue assets transferred to buzztime and this could devalue your holdings in ntn  because we would not receive the fair value for our interest in buzztime 
risk factors associated with buzztime if our new buzztime programming is not accepted by consumers  we are not likely to generate significant revenues or become profitable 
the new buzztime channel faces risks as to whether consumers will accept interactive television products and the trivia programming produced by buzztime 
if interactive television does not become a successful  scalable medium or if consumers do not accept trivia and play along sports games  then we will be unable to draw revenues from advertising  direct marketing of third party products  subscription fees and pay per play fees 
until a sufficient market develops for the digital set top boxes enabled to run our interactive television game applications  our profit potential is uncertain and we may also face competition from companies developing and marketing stand alone game products and services 
we will also be unable to attract local cable operators to add buzztime programming as a channel to their service 
the market for interactive television games and services is new and may not develop as anticipated 
the interactive television market currently is small and emerging 
our success will depend on the growth and development of this market in the united states and it will depend upon the commercialization and broad acceptance by consumers and businesses of a wide variety of interactive television products 
demand and market acceptance of recently introduced products and services are subject to a high level of uncertainty and  as a result  our profit potential is unproven 
in addition  the potential size of this new market opportunity and the timing of its development and deployment are currently uncertain 
development schedules of interactive television offered by our competitors have been delayed or refocused as the industry evolves 
if the market for interactive television does not develop or develops more slowly than anticipated  our revenues will not grow as fast as anticipated  if at all 
the adoption of incompatible standards could render our products obsolete or non competitive 
if a new digital set top box standard is defined  we do not know whether our products will be compatible with such a standard once it is defined 
the establishment of multiple standards could hurt our business and significantly increase our expenses  particularly if our products require significant redevelopment in order to conform to the newly established standards 
any delay or failure on our part to respond quickly  cost effectively and sufficiently to these developments could render our existing products and services obsolete and cause us not to be competitive  resulting in a decrease in our revenues without a corresponding decrease in our expenses 
we may have to incur substantial expenditures to modify or adapt our products or services to respond to these developments 
we must be able to incorporate new technologies into the products we design and develop in order to address the increasingly complex and varied needs of our customer base 
increasing government regulation could cause demand for our products and services to decline significantly 
we are subject not only to regulations applicable to businesses generally  but also laws and regulations that apply directly to the industry of interactive television products 
although there are currently few such laws and regulations  state and federal governments may adopt a number of these laws and regulations governing any of the following issues o user privacy  o copyrights  o consumer protection  o the media distribution of specific material or content  and o the characteristics and quality of interactive television products and services 
one or more states or the federal government could enact regulations aimed at companies  like us  which provide interactive television products 
the likelihood of such regulation being enacted will increase as interactive television becomes more pervasive and extends to more people s daily lives 
any such legislation or regulation could dampen the growth of the industry of interactive television 
if such a reduction in growth occurs  demand for our products and services may decline significantly 
on january   the federal communications commission fcc issued a notice of inquiry concerning interactive television 
the notice raised a series of questions that suggest that cable systems might be regarded as essential  open platforms of spectrum for non discriminatory third party access  rather than facilities based providers competing in a wider market 
the notice sought comments on the nature of interactive television and whether cable systems will be a superior platform for providing interactive television 
the notice asked very detailed questions  many of which arise from a common regulatory premise whether cable operators who are affiliated with interactive television providers should not be permitted to discriminate in favor of their own interactive television services with respect to spectrum usage and whether interactive television providers affiliated with cable operators may need to be subjected to non discrimination rules so that they may not obtain leverage from any exclusive arrangement they would otherwise negotiate with popular programmers 
the outcome of the notice will determine whether or not a subsequent rulemaking will be held in order to create regulations for the interactive television industry 
any regulation of this industry could impact on buzztime and its operations 
we may have difficulty recruiting professionals for our business 
our business requires experienced programmers  creative designers  and application developers 
our success will depend on identifying  hiring  training and retaining such experienced  knowledgeable professionals 
we must recruit talented professionals in order for our business to grow 
there is significant competition for employees with the skills required to develop the products and perform the services we offer 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract a sufficient number of qualified employees in the future to sustain and grow our business  or that we will be successful in motivating and retaining the employees we are able to attract 
if we cannot attract  motivate and retain qualified professionals  our business  financial condition and results of operations will suffer 
risk factors associated with our common stock we do not comply with the american stock exchange guidelines and may be delisted or suspended from trading 
in  the american stock exchange amex adopted several new listing standards 
one new standard was established for listed companies that had at least five consecutive years of losses as we do 
such companies must maintain shareholders equity of at least million 
we submitted a plan to achieve compliance with that standard to amex  which they approved with the understanding that compliance would be demonstrated on or about mid november our plan was to increase our shareholders equity through a combination of conversion of equity like instruments including the exchange of buzztime series a preferred stock held by scientific atlanta and the conversion of our subordinated convertible notes on our balance sheet and by raising additional equity 
the combination of the conversions of the equity like instruments and the million investment by robert m 
bennett in january with our december  shareholders equity position of million yields a sum of million 
while the january events have occurred on dates outside of the timeframe allowed under our plan with amex  the amex staff has continued to monitor our financial performance and the outcome of our equity raising efforts and has allowed us to continue our listing on an exception basis 
we remain in discussions with several strategic investors as well as financial investors that we have contacted through investment banking firms 
we also have considered several acquisitions for stock which would additionally bring us into compliance 
we believe that if we do not exercise our options and fail to achieve compliance with the new million net worth standard within approximately one month of filing this document  we will likely enter into a process of letters and hearings regarding our continued listing 
we believe that process will take several months 
we continue to believe that we will be able to raise the additional equity capital or consummate an acquisition for stock in order to comply with our plan with amex during the extended time period afforded by the amex hearing process 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional equity financing on terms favorable to us or at all 
to date  amex has not taken any action regarding delisting 
still  our common stock may not remain listed on amex or any other exchange or quotation system in the future 
if our common stock is delisted from amex  spreads can often be higher for securities traded on the over the counter market and the execution time for orders may be longer 
thus  removing our stock from amex may result in decreased liquidity by making the trading of our stock less efficient 
our stock price has been highly volatile and your investment could suffer a decrease in value 
the trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations 
the stock price may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors  such as quarterly variations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products and media properties by us or our competitors  changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts  the operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable  and news reports relating to trends in our markets 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the market prices for internet related companies in particular  have experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our stock  regardless of our operating performance 
our charter contains provisions that may hinder or prevent a change in control of our company  which could result in our inability to approve a change in control and potentially receive a premium over the current market value of your stock 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us  even if such a change in control would benefit our stockholders 
for example  our certificate of incorporation requires a supermajority vote of at least of the total voting power  voting together as a single class  to amend certain provisions of such document  including those provisions relating to o the number  election and term of directors  o the removal of directors and the filling of vacancies  and o the supermajority voting requirements of our certificate of incorporation 
these provisions could discourage third parties from taking over control of our company 
such provisions may also impede a transaction in which you could receive a premium over then current market prices and your ability to approve a transaction that you consider in your best interests 
if the shares of our common stock eligible for future sale are sold  the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected 
future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market or the anticipation of such sales could have a material adverse effect on then prevailing market prices 
as of february   there were approximately  shares of common stock reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding stock options at exercise prices ranging from to per share 
as of february   there were also outstanding warrants to purchase an aggregate of approximately  shares of common stock at exercise prices ranging from to per share 
as of february   there were approximately  shares of common stock issued upon the conversion of the senior convertible subordinated notes at a conversion price of 
additionally  we have approximately million of common stock remaining under our existing shelf registration for possible future sale 
the foregoing options and warrants could adversely affect our ability to obtain future financing or engage in certain mergers or other transactions  since the holders of these options and warrants can be expected to exercise them at a time when we would be able to obtain additional capital through a new offering of securities on terms more favorable than those provided by such options and warrants 
for the life of such options and warrants  the holders are given the opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price of our common stock without assuming the risk of ownership 
to the extent the trading price of our common stock at the time of exercise of any such options or warrants exceeds the exercise price  such exercise will have a dilutive effect on our stockholders 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to risks related to currency exchange rates  stock market fluctuations  and interest rates 
as of december   we owned common stock of an australian company that is subject to market risk 
at december   the carrying value of this investment was  which is net of a  unrealized loss 
this investment is exposed to further market risk in the future based on the operating results of the australian company and stock market fluctuations 
additionally  the value of the investment is further subject to changes in australian currency exchange rates 
at december   a hypothetical decline in the value of the australian dollar would result in a reduction of  in the carrying value of the investment 
we have outstanding convertible notes which bear interest at per annum and line of credit borrowings which bear a rate equal to the prime rate plus per annum  which cannot be less than per annum 
at december   a hypothetical one percentage point increase in the prime rate would result in an increase of  in annual interest expense 
on february   the convertible notes converted to ntn common stock 
we do not have any derivative financial instruments 
nor do we have any speculative or hedging instruments
