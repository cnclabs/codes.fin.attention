item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction constellation energy group  inc constellation energy is a north american energy company that conducts its business through various subsidiaries including a merchant energy business and baltimore gas and electric company bge 
we describe our operating segments in note this report is a combined report of constellation energy and bge 
references in this report to we and our are to constellation energy and its subsidiaries  collectively 
references in this report to the utility business are to bge 
our merchant energy business is a competitive provider of energy solutions for large customers in north america 
it has electric generation assets located in various regions of the united states and provides energy solutions to meet customers needs 
our merchant energy business focuses on serving the full energy and capacity requirements load serving activities of  and providing other risk management activities for various customers  such as utilities  municipalities  cooperatives  retail aggregators  and large commercial and industrial customers 
these load serving activities typically occur in regional markets in which end use customer electricity rates have been deregulated and thereby separated from the cost of generation supply 
bge is a regulated electric and gas public transmission and distribution utility company with a service territory that covers the city of baltimore and all or part of ten counties in central maryland 
our other nonregulated businesses design  construct  and operate single site heating  cooling  and cogeneration facilities for commercial and industrial customers  provide home improvements  service heating  air conditioning  plumbing  electrical  and indoor air quality systems  and provide electric and natural gas retail marketing  and own and operate a district cooling system for commercial customers in the city of baltimore  maryland 
in addition  we own several investments that we do not consider to be core operations 
these include financial investments  real estate projects  and interests in a latin american distribution project and in a fund that holds interests in two south american energy projects 
we sold certain non core assets in and closed our retail merchandise stores in december in this discussion and analysis  we explain the general financial condition and the results of operations for constellation energy and bge including factors which affect our businesses  our earnings and costs in the periods presented  changes in earnings and costs between periods  sources of earnings  impact of these factors on our overall financial condition  expected future expenditures for capital projects  and expected sources of cash for future capital expenditures 
as you read this discussion and analysis  refer to our consolidated statements of income  which present the results of our operations for   and we analyze and explain the differences between periods in the specific line items of the consolidated statements of income 
effective july   electric generation was deregulated in maryland and bge transferred all of its generation assets and related liabilities at book value to our merchant energy business 
as a result  the financial results of the electric generation portion of our business are included in the merchant energy business beginning july  prior to july   the financial results of electric generation were included in bge s regulated electric business 
we discuss the deregulation of electric generation in the electric competition maryland section 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements that were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
management makes estimates and assumptions when preparing financial statements 
these estimates and assumptions affect various matters  including our reported amounts of assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets at the dates of the financial statements  our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements  and our reported amounts of revenues and expenses in our consolidated statements of income during the reporting periods 
these estimates involve judgments with respect to numerous factors that are difficult to predict and are beyond management s control 
as a result  actual amounts could materially differ from these estimates 
management believes the following accounting policies represent critical accounting policies as defined by the sec 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgment  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
we discuss our significant accounting policies  including those that do not require management to make difficult  subjective  or complex judgments or estimates  in note revenue recognition mark to market method of accounting our merchant energy business engages in origination and risk management activities using contracts for energy  other energy related commodities  and related derivative contracts 
we record merchant energy business revenues using two methods of accounting accrual accounting and mark to market accounting 
we describe our use of accrual accounting in more detail in note on october   the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue  recognition and reporting of gains and losses on energy trading contracts under eitf issues no 
and no 
eitf affects how we apply the mark to market method of accounting 
we describe our accounting for energy contracts and the impact of eitf below 
we use mark to market accounting for energy trading activities and for derivatives and other contracts for which we are not permitted to use accrual accounting or hedge accounting 
these mark to market activities include derivative and prior to eitf non derivative contracts for energy and other energy related commodities 
under the mark to market method of accounting  we record the fair value of energy contracts as mark to market energy assets and liabilities at the time of contract execution 
we record the changes in mark to market energy assets and liabilities on a net basis in nonregulated revenues in our consolidated statements of income 
at december   mark to market energy assets and liabilities consisted of a combination of energy and energy related derivative and non derivative contracts 
while some of these contracts represent commodities or instruments for which prices are available from external sources  other commodities and certain contracts are not actively traded and are valued using modeling techniques to determine expected future market prices  contract quantities  or both 
the market prices and quantities used to determine fair value reflect management s best estimate considering various factors 
however  future market prices and actual quantities will vary from those used in recording mark to market energy assets and liabilities  and it is possible that such variations could be material 
we record reserves to reflect uncertainties associated with certain estimates inherent in the determination of fair value that are not incorporated in market price information or other market based estimates used to determine fair value of our mark to market energy contracts 
to the extent possible  we utilize market based data together with quantitative methods for both measuring the risks for which we record reserves and determining the level of such reserves and changes in those levels 
we describe below the main types of reserves we record and the process for establishing each 
generally  increases in reserves reduce our earnings  and decreases in reserves increase our earnings 
however  all or a portion of the effect on earnings of changes in reserves may be offset by changes in the value of the underlying positions 
close out reserve this reserve represents the estimated cost to close out or sell to a third party open mark to market positions 
this reserve has the effect of valuing long positions at the bid price and short positions at the offer price 
we compute this reserve based on our estimate of the bid offer spread for each commodity and option price and the absolute quantity of our open positions for each year 
effective july   to the extent that we are not able to obtain market information for similar contracts  the close out reserve is equivalent to the initial contract margin  thereby resulting in no gain or loss at inception 
the level of total close out reserves increases as we have larger unhedged positions  bid offer spreads increase  or market information is not available  and it decreases as we reduce our unhedged positions  bid offer spreads decrease  or market information becomes available 
credit spread adjustment for risk management purposes  we compute the value of our mark to market assets and liabilities using a risk free discount rate 
in order to compute fair value for financial reporting purposes  we adjust the value of our mark to market assets to reflect the credit worthiness of each individual counterparty based upon published credit ratings  where available  or equivalent internal credit ratings and associated default probability percentages 
we compute this reserve by applying the appropriate default probability percentage to our outstanding credit exposure  net of collateral  for each counterparty 
the level of this reserve increases as our credit exposure to counterparties increases  the maturity terms of our transactions increase  or the credit ratings of our counterparties deteriorate  and it decreases when our credit exposure to counterparties decreases  the maturity terms of our transactions decrease  or the credit ratings of our counterparties improve 
market prices for energy and energy related commodities vary based upon a number of factors 
changes in market prices will affect both the recorded fair value of our mark to market energy contracts and the level of future revenues and costs associated with accrual basis activities 
changes in the value of our mark to market energy contracts will affect our earnings in the period of the change  while changes in forward market prices related to accrual basis revenues and costs will affect our earnings in future periods 
we cannot predict whether or to what extent the factors affecting market prices may change  but those changes could be material and could affect us either favorably or unfavorably 
we discuss our market risk in more detail in the market risk section 
on october   the eitf reached a consensus on issue that changed the accounting for certain energy contracts 
the main provisions of issue are as follows eitf prohibits the use of mark to market accounting for any energy related contracts that are not derivatives 
any contracts subject to eitf must be accounted for on the accrual basis and recorded in the income statement gross rather than net upon application of eitf this change applied immediately to new contracts executed after october  and applied to existing non derivative energy related contracts beginning january  we are required to report the impact of initially applying eitf as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
the eitf minutes on issue indicate that an entity should not record unrealized gains or losses at the inception of derivative contracts unless the fair value of the contracts is evidenced by observable market data 
applying eitf will not affect our cash flows or our accounting for new load serving contracts for which we have been using accrual accounting since early additionally  we continued to mark existing non derivative energy related contracts to market for the remainder of however  eitf requires us to record a non cash  cumulative effect adjustment to convert these non derivative mark to market contracts to accrual accounting no later than january  we reviewed our portfolio of mark to market contracts to identify the contracts that are subject to the requirements of eitf the primary contracts that are affected are our full requirements load serving contracts and unit contingent power purchase contracts  which are not derivatives 
the majority of these contracts are in texas and new england and were entered into prior to the shift to accrual accounting earlier in additionally  we reviewed derivatives we use as supply sources and hedges of contracts that are subject to eitf to the extent permitted by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  we designated derivative contracts used to fulfill our load serving contracts as either normal purchases or cash flow hedges under sfas no 
effective january  we summarize the impact on our consolidated balance sheets of applying eitf on january  as follows assets liabilities net in millions mark to market energy contracts current noncurrent  total  other current noncurrent total balance at december    impact of eitf adoption non derivative net asset reversed as cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle mark to market energy contracts other total non derivative net asset reversed as cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle derivatives designated as hedges derivatives designated as normal purchases and sales mark to market derivatives remaining after adoption of eitf on january  on january   we recorded the million non derivative net asset removed from our consolidated balance sheets as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  which will reduce our net income by million 
the million represents million of non derivative contracts recorded as mark to market energy assets and liabilities and million of other assets and liabilities from the re designation of texas contracts to accrual accounting earlier in the fair value of these contracts will be recognized in earnings as power is delivered 
additionally  on january   we reclassified the fair value of derivatives designated as hedges as risk management assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and will account for these hedges in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
at that time  we also reclassified the fair value of derivatives designated as normal purchases and normal sales as other assets and liabilities in the balance sheet and will account for these contracts on the accrual basis  with the fair value amortized into earnings over the lives of the underlying contracts 
we cannot predict the impact of applying the provisions of eitf in the future 
those provisions prohibit mark to market accounting for gains at the inception of new non derivative energy contracts  require accrual accounting for those contracts  and limit the ability to record gains at the inception of new derivative contracts 
we believe that our shift to accrual accounting for new physical delivery transactions in early is consistent with the requirement of eitf to use accrual accounting for non derivative contracts 
however  the impact of applying eitf in the future will be affected by many factors  including our ability to designate and qualify derivative contracts for normal purchase and sale accounting or hedge accounting under sfas no 
 potential volatility in earnings from derivative contracts that serve as economic hedges but do not meet the accounting requirements to qualify for normal purchase and sale accounting or hedge accounting  our ability to enter into new mark to market derivative origination transactions  and sufficient liquidity and transparency in the energy markets to permit us to record gains at inception of new derivative contracts because fair value is evidenced by quoted market prices or current market transactions 
while we cannot predict the ongoing impact of applying eitf  the timing of recognizing earnings on new transactions will change 
in general  earnings on new transactions will no longer be recognized at the inception of the transactions under mark to market accounting because they will be recognized over the term of the transaction 
as a result  while total earnings over the term of a transaction will be unchanged  we expect that our reported earnings for contracts subject to eitf will generally match the cash flows from those contracts more closely and may be less volatile under accrual accounting than under mark to market accounting  which reflects changes in fair value of contracts when they occur rather than when products are delivered and costs are incurred 
alternatively  other comprehensive income may have greater fluctuations after we apply eitf because of a larger number of derivative contracts that we designated for hedge accounting under sfas no 
 but these fluctuations will not affect earnings or cash flows 
additionally  because we will record revenues and costs on a gross basis under accrual accounting  our revenues and costs could increase  but our earnings will not be affected by gross versus net reporting 
we discuss the impact of mark to market accounting on our financial results in the results of operations merchant energy business section 
evaluation of assets for impairment and other than temporary decline in value we are required to evaluate certain assets that have long lives for example  generating property and equipment and real estate to determine if they are impaired when certain conditions exist 
sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  provides the accounting for impairments of long lived assets 
we are required to test our long lived assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
examples of such events or changes would be as follows a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset  a significant adverse change in the manner an asset is being used or its physical condition  an adverse action by a regulator or in the business climate  an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the construction or acquisition of an asset  a current period loss combined with a history of losses or the projection of future losses  or a change in our intent about an asset from an intent to hold to a greater than likelihood that an asset will be sold or disposed of before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
for long lived assets that are expected to be held and used  sfas no 
requires that an impairment loss shall only be recognized if the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable under sfas no 
if the carrying amount exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
therefore  when we believe an impairment condition may have occurred  we are required to estimate the undiscounted future cash flows associated with a long lived asset or group of long lived assets 
this necessarily involves judgement surrounding the inherent uncertainty of future cash flows 
in order to estimate an asset s future cash flows  we will consider historical cash flows  as well as reflect our understanding of the extent to which future cash flows will be either similar to or different from past experience based on all available evidence 
to the extent applicable  the assumptions we use are consistent with forecasts that we are otherwise required to make for example  in preparing our other earnings forecasts 
if we are considering alternative courses of action to recover the carrying amount of a long lived asset such as the potential sale of an asset  we probability weight the alternative courses of action to establish the cash flows 
we use our best estimates in making these evaluations and consider various factors  including forward price curves for energy  fuel costs  legislative initiatives  and operating costs 
however  actual future market prices and project costs could vary from the assumptions used in our estimates  and the impact of such variations could be material 
for long lived assets that can be classified as assets to be disposed of by sale under sfas no 
 an impairment loss shall be recognized to the extent their carrying amount exceeds their fair value  including costs to sell 
the estimation of fair value under sfas no 
 whether in conjunction with an asset to be held and used or with an asset to be disposed of by sale  also involves estimation and judgment 
we consider quoted market prices in active markets to the extent they are available 
in the absence of such information  we may look to prices of similar assets  consult with brokers  or employ other valuation techniques 
often  we will discount the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset using a single interest rate that is commensurate with the risk involved with such an investment or employ an expected present value method that probability weights a range of possible outcomes 
the use of these methods involves the same inherent uncertainty of future cash flows as discussed above with respect to undiscounted cash flows and actual future market prices and project costs could vary from those used in our estimates  and the impact of such variations could be material 
we also are required to evaluate our equity method and cost method investments for example  in partnerships that own power projects to determine whether or not they are impaired 
accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock  provides the accounting for these investments 
the standard for determining whether an impairment must be recorded under apb no 
is whether the investment has experienced a loss in value that is considered an other than a temporary decline in value 
the evaluation and measurement of impairments under the apb no 
standard involves the same uncertainties as described above for long lived assets that we own directly and account for in accordance with sfas no 
similarly  the estimates that we make with respect to our equity and cost method investments are subject to variation  and the impact of such variations could be material 
additionally  if the projects in which we hold these investments recognize an impairment under the provisions of sfas no 
 we would record our proportionate share of that impairment loss and would evaluate our investment for an other than temporary decline in value under apb no 
significant events in  we recorded the following special items in earnings pre tax after tax in millions workforce reduction costs costs associated with programs costs associated with programs initiated in total workforce reduction costs impairment losses and other costs impairments of investments in qualifying facilities and power projects costs associated with exit of bge home merchandise stores impairments of real estate and international investments total impairment losses and other costs net gain on sales of investments and other assets total special items we also discuss these special items in note workforce reduction costs during  we incurred costs related to workforce reduction efforts initiated in the fourth quarter of as discussed in the section and additional initiatives undertaken in we discuss these costs in more detail below 
costs associated with programs in  we recorded million of net workforce reduction costs associated with our workforce initiatives as discussed below 
the million included million recognized as expense  of which bge recognized million 
the remaining million was recognized by bge as a regulatory asset related to its gas business 
we recorded million when employees elected the age to voluntary special early retirement program vserp 
we reversed million of the million involuntary severance accrual that was recorded in to reflect the employees that elected the age to vserp and whose costs were included in that program 
ultimately  we involuntarily severed employees that resulted in a total cost for the involuntary severance program of million 
we recorded million of settlement charges related to our pension plans under sfas no 
 employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits 
these charges reflect the recognition of actuarial gains and losses associated with employees who have retired and taken their pension in the form of a lump sum payment 
under sfas no 
 the settlement charge could not be recognized until lump sum pension payments exceeded annual pension plan service and interest cost  which occurred in we recorded a million expense associated with deferred payments to employees eligible for the vserp 
partially offsetting these costs  we reversed approximately million of previously accrued workforce reduction costs primarily as a result of the reversal of education and outplacement assistance benefits we accrued that employees did not utilize to the extent expected 
costs associated with programs in  we recorded million of expenses for anticipated involuntary severance costs in accordance with eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring associated with new workforce reduction initiatives as follows we recorded million for workforce reduction costs for the severance of employees at calvert cliffs nuclear power plant calvert cliffs 
we recorded million of workforce reduction costs for the severance of employees in our information technology organization 
bge recorded million of this amount 
we recorded million of workforce reduction costs for the severance of employees in our legal organization 
bge recorded million of this amount 
ongoing impacts as a result of our workforce reduction programs and other process improvements  we expect to realize cost savings from productivity initiatives of approximately million in impairment losses and other costs investments in qualifying facilities and power projects our merchant energy business recorded impairment losses on certain of the investments in qualifying facilities and power projects totaling million under the provisions of apb no 
the provisions of apb no 
require that an impairment loss be recognized when an investment experiences a loss in value that is other than temporary as discussed in our critical accounting policies section 
during the third quarter of  we performed an analysis of whether any of the investments were impaired 
as a result of our analysis  we concluded that the declines in value of particular investments in certain qualifying facilities and power projects were other than temporary in nature under the provisions of apb no 
and we recognized the following losses in we recognized a million other than temporary decline in value of our investment in a partnership that owns a geothermal project in nevada 
this project experienced a well implosion and we believe that the expected cash flows from the project will not be sufficient to recover our equity interest in that partnership 
we recognized a million other than temporary decline in value of our investment in a fuel processing site in pennsylvania where the expected cash flows from a sublease are no longer expected to be sufficient to recover our lease costs associated with this site 
we recognized a million other than temporary decline in value of our investment in a partnership that owns a waste burning power project in michigan 
at december   our investment in qualifying facilities and domestic power projects consisted of the following project type book value in millions geothermal coal hydroelectric biomass fuel processing solar total we believe the current market conditions for our equity method investments that own geothermal  coal  hydroelectric  and fuel processing projects provide sufficient positive cash flows to recover our investments 
we continuously monitor issues that potentially could impact future profitability of these investments  including environmental and legislative initiatives 
we discuss certain risks and uncertainties in more detail in our forward looking statements section 
however  should future events cause these investments to become uneconomic  our investments in these projects could become impaired under the provisions of apb no 
we have an investment in a partnership that owns a geothermal project with a book value of million at december  currently  the project is not generating at its designed capacity 
the project is drilling wells at this site to restore the generation and we expect the geothermal resource to be sufficient to enable the project to generate adequate cash flows over the life of this project to recover our equity interest in that investment 
however  should current or future well drilling at this site prove to be unsuccessful or become uneconomic causing us not to make future investments in this partnership  our investment in this partnership could become impaired under the provisions of apb no 
and any losses recognized could be material 
the ability to recover our costs in our equity method investments that own biomass and solar projects is partially dependent upon subsidies from the state of california 
under the california public utility act  subsidies currently exist in that the california public utilities commission cpuc requires electric corporations to identify a separate rate component to fund the development of renewable resources technologies  including solar  biomass  and wind facilities 
in addition  recently enacted legislation in california requires that each electric corporation increase its total procurement of eligible renewable energy resources by at least one percent per year so that of its retail sales are procured from eligible renewable energy resources by the legislation also requires the california energy commission to award supplemental energy payments to electric corporations to cover above market costs of renewable energy 
given the need for electric power and the desire for renewable resource technologies  we believe california will continue to subsidize the use of renewable energy to make these projects economical to operate 
however  should the california legislation fail to adequately support the renewable energy initiatives  our equity method investments in these types of projects could become impaired under the provisions of apb no 
 and any losses recognized could be material 
if our strategy were to change from an intent to hold to an intent to sell for any of our equity method investments in qualifying facilities or power projects  we would need to adjust their book value to fair value  and that adjustment could be material 
if we were to sell these investments in the current market  we may have losses that could be material 
closing of bge home retail merchandise stores in september  we announced our decision to close our bge home retail merchandise stores 
in connection with that decision  we recognized approximately million in exit costs 
we recognized million related to expected severance costs for employees and million of costs in connection with the termination of leases for the eight stores and other exit costs in accordance with eitf we also recognized million for the write off of unamortized leasehold improvements in accordance with sfas no 
 and million for the write down of inventory to a lower of cost or market valuation in accordance with accounting research bulletin no 
 restatement and revision of accounting research bulletins 
the million is included in operating expenses in our consolidated statements of income 
real estate and international investments as discussed in the section  we changed our strategy from an intent to hold to an intent to sell for certain of our non core assets in during  we determined that the fair value of several real estate projects and our investment in a south american generation project declined below their respective book values due to deteriorating market conditions for these projects 
accordingly  we recorded losses that totaled million for these projects in accordance with sfas no 
and apb no 
in  we sold our investment in a south american generation project for approximately book value 
net gain on sales of investments and other assets in february  reliant resources  inc acquired all of the outstanding shares of orion power holdings  inc orion for per share  including the shares we owned of orion 
we received cash proceeds of million and recognized a gain of million on the sale of our investment 
in the fourth quarter of  we announced our decision to focus efforts and capital on core domestic energy businesses and undertook a plan to sell a number of non core businesses and investments 
in  we made further progress on this initiative  and recognized approximately million in net gains from the sale of several non core assets including our other nonregulated businesses recognized gains totaling million on the sale of several parcels of real estate and financial investments 
in october  we sold all of our senior living facilities for million that represents a combination of cash and the assumption by the buyer of existing mortgages 
our other nonregulated businesses recognized a million gain on the sale of our entire ownership interest in these facilities 
our merchant energy business recognized a million gain on the sale of a discontinued wind powered development project 
in  our merchant energy business recognized an impairment loss on four turbines  associated with a discontinued development program as discussed in the section 
since that time  many other companies canceled development projects and the market values for turbines have declined significantly 
orders for three of the four turbines were canceled with termination fees paid to the manufacturer consistent with the amount recognized in december the fourth turbine generator set was sold during for million below its book value 
in addition  we sold all of our corporate office properties trust copt equity method investment in  approximately million shares  as part of a public offering 
we received cash proceeds of million on the sale  which approximated the book value of our investment 
acquisitions newenergy on september   we completed our purchase of aes newenergy  inc from aes corporation 
subsequent to the acquisition  we renamed aes newenergy  inc as constellation newenergy  inc 
newenergy 
newenergy is a leading national provider of electricity  natural gas  and energy services  serving approximately  megawatts mw of load associated with large commercial and industrial customers in competitive energy markets including the northeast  mid atlantic  midwest  texas and california 
we acquired ownership of newenergy for cash of million including million of direct costs associated with the acquisition 
we acquired cash of million as part of the purchase 
we describe the net assets acquired in note we include the results of newenergy in our merchant energy business segment beginning on the date of acquisition 
alliance on december   we purchased alliance energy services  llc and fellon mccord associates  inc collectively  alliance from allegheny energy  inc these businesses provide gas supply and transportation services and energy consulting services to large commercial and industrial businesses primarily in the midwest region  but also in other competitive energy markets including the northeast  mid atlantic  texas and california regions 
we acquired ownership of these companies for a note payable of million that was settled in cash on january  we acquired cash of million as part of the purchase 
we describe the net assets acquired in note we will include the operating results of alliance in our merchant energy business segment in renegotiations of our high desert power contract we are currently leasing and supervising the construction of the high desert power project 
the project is scheduled for completion in mid in april  we amended our high desert power project long term power sales agreement with the state of california to provide revised pricing and more flexibility in the amount of electricity purchased from the plant by the california department of water resources cdwr and the timing of such purchases 
this amended agreement provides the state of california with the flexibility they desired  while preserving our overall economics and reducing our regulatory  fuel  and legal risks 
the contract is a tolling structure  under which the cdwr will pay a fixed amount of million per month and provides cdwr the right  but not the obligation  to purchase power from the high desert power project at a price linked to the variable cost of production 
during the term of the contract  which runs for seven years and nine months from the commercial operation date of the plant  the high desert power project will provide energy exclusively to the cdwr 
we also signed a comprehensive settlement agreement with the cdwr  the california energy oversight board eob  the cpuc  the california attorney general  and the governor of california by which each of these parties agreed to release claims against us arising out of the original and renegotiated contracts 
under the settlement agreement  the california parties filed with the federal energy regulatory commission ferc to withdraw us from the regulatory complaint filed at the ferc by the cpuc and eob against all holders of long term power contracts 
we agreed to pay million into a school and public buildings energy retrofit fund and another million to the attorney general s office in order to conclude this overall comprehensive settlement package 
we discuss our high desert project in more detail in the capital resources section 
generating facilities commence operations the following generating facilities commenced operations during the second half of our origination and risk management operation manages the output of these plants 
plant location capacity mw type primary fuel rio nogales seguin  tx combined cycle natural gas oleander brevard co  fl combustion turbine natural gas holland energy shelby co  il combined cycle natural gas pension plan at december   we recorded an after tax charge to equity of million as a result of increasing our additional minimum pension liability 
we discuss this in more detail in note as a result of declines in the financial markets  our actual return on pension plan assets was a loss of approximately for the year ended december  we assume an expected return on pension plan assets of for the purpose of computing annual net periodic pension expense 
we determined our assumption for expected return on pension plan assets in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
this assumption reflects our targeted long term investment allocation of equities and fixed income securities for our pension plan assets 
we set the level of this assumed return based on a review of average  actual returns for these categories of investments over a long term period 
some years our actual return on pension assets will exceed the expected return  resulting in an actuarial gain  and some years our actual return will fall short of the expected return  resulting in an actuarial loss 
these differences between actual and expected returns are deferred along with other actuarial gains and losses and reflected in future net periodic pension expense in accordance with sfas no 
expected and actual returns on pension assets also are affected by plan contributions 
in  we contributed million to our pension plans  which included million to the constellation energy qualified pension plan and amounts received from the sellers of nine mile point to the nine mile point pension plan 
as of the date of this report  we contributed an additional million to our pension plans in certain relationships thomas f 
brady  a senior vice president of constellation energy is a trustee of copt 
constellation energy sold some of its real estate holdings to copt in for an aggregate price of less than million 
constellation energy sold  and anticipates selling  additional real estate holdings to copt in for an aggregate price of less than million 
the real estate sales were made  and future sales will be made  on an arm s length basis 
in  we recorded the following special items in earnings pre tax after tax in millions workforce reduction costs voluntary termination benefits vserp settlement and curtailment charges involuntary severance accrual total workforce reduction costs contract termination related costs impairment losses and other costs cancellation of domestic power projects impairments of real estate  senior living  and international investments reduction of financial investment total impairment losses and other costs net gain on the sales of investments and other assets total special items we also discuss these special items in note workforce reduction costs in the fourth quarter of  we undertook several measures to reduce our workforce through both voluntary and involuntary means 
the purpose of these programs was to reduce our operating costs to become more competitive 
as part of this initiative  several companies  including our merchant energy business and bge  announced several workforce reduction initiatives to provide enhanced retirement benefits to certain eligible participants that elected to retire in and other involuntary severance programs 
as a result  we recorded million of expenses related to these programs during the fourth quarter of bge recorded million of this amount as expense relating to its electric and gas businesses 
bge also recorded million on its balance sheet as a regulatory asset of its gas business 
contract termination related costs we announced the termination of our power business services agreement with goldman sachs co 
goldman sachs in we paid goldman sachs a total of million  representing million to terminate the power business services agreement with our origination and risk management operation and million previously recognized as a payable for services rendered under the agreement 
we issued commercial paper and borrowed under our existing bank lines to fund this payment 
in the fourth quarter of  we recognized expenses of approximately million related to the termination of the contract with goldman sachs 
impairment losses and other costs in the fourth quarter of  our merchant energy business recorded impairments of million primarily due to the termination of all planned development projects not under construction  including projects in texas  california  florida  and massachusetts  and due to a decline in value of an investment in a power project in michigan 
we decided to terminate our development projects due to the expected excess generation capacity in most domestic markets and the significant decline in the forward market prices of electricity 
the impairments included costs associated with four turbines no longer expected to be placed in service 
in the fourth quarter of  our other nonregulated businesses recorded million in impairments of certain non core assets as follows we decided to sell six real estate projects without further development and our senior living facilities 
we decided to accelerate the exit strategies for two other real estate projects that we will continue to hold and own over the next several years 
we decided to accelerate the exit strategy for the investment in a distribution company in panama 
there was an other than temporary decline in value in our equity method bolivian investment due to a deterioration in our investment s position in the bolivian capacity market 
in addition  our financial investments business recorded a million reduction of its investment in an aircraft due to the decline in value of used airplanes as a result of the september  terrorist attacks and the general downturn in the aviation industry 
net gain on the sales of investments and other assets during  our other nonregulated businesses recognized a million gain on the sale of non core assets  including a million gain on the sale of one million shares of our orion investment and million on the sales of other financial investments 
in addition  on november   we sold our guatemalan power plant operations to an affiliate of duke energy international  llc  the international business unit of duke energy 
through this sale  duke energy acquired grupo generador de guatemala y cia  sca  which owns two generating plants at esquintla and lake amatitlan in guatemala 
the combined capacity of the plants is megawatts 
we decided to sell our guatemalan operations to focus our efforts on our core north american energy businesses 
as a result of this transaction  we are no longer committed to making significant future capital investments in this non core operation 
we recorded a loss of million in the fourth quarter of resulting from this sale 
nine mile point on november   we completed our purchase of the nine mile point nuclear station nine mile point located in scriba  new york 
nine mile point nuclear station  llc  a subsidiary of constellation nuclear  purchased percent of nine mile point unit and percent of unit for cash of million including settlement costs and a sellers note of million to be repaid over five years with an interest rate of 
this note was prepaid in april the sellers also transferred approximately million in decommissioning funds 
as a result of this purchase  we own  megawatts of nine mile point s  megawatts of total generating capacity 
we sell of our share of nine mile point s output  on a unit contingent basis if the output is not available because the plant is not operating  there is no requirement to provide output from other sources  back to the sellers at an average price of nearly per megawatt hour for approximately years under power purchase agreements 
we describe the net assets acquired in note bethlehem steel on october   bethlehem steel corporation filed for reorganization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
bethlehem steel s sparrows point plant  located in baltimore  maryland is bge s largest customer  accounting for approximately three percent of electric revenues and one percent of gas revenues 
at december  and  our exposure to bethlehem steel was not material 
there is uncertainty regarding the continuation of bethlehem steel s operations  however  we do not expect the impact to be material to our financial results 
strategy we are pursuing an integrated energy platform that provides a balanced mix of stable and predictable earnings from regulated utility operations with a growth platform from merchant energy operations 
the strategy for our merchant energy business is to be a leading competitive provider of energy solutions for large customers in north america 
our merchant energy business has electric generation assets located in various regions of the united states and has an origination and risk management operation that focuses on providing energy solutions to meet customers needs throughout north america 
the integration of electric generation assets with origination and risk management of energy and energy related commodities allows our merchant energy business to manage energy price risk over geographic regions and over time 
our focus is on providing solutions to customers energy needs  and our origination and risk management operation adds value to our generation assets by providing national market access  market infrastructure  real time market intelligence  risk management and arbitrage opportunities  and transmission and transportation expertise 
generation capacity supports our origination and risk management operation by providing a source of reliable power supply that provides a physical hedge for some of our load serving activities 
to achieve our strategic objectives  we expect to continue to pursue opportunities that expand our access to customers and to support our origination and risk management operation with generation assets that have diversified geographic  fuel  and dispatch characteristics 
we also expect to use a disciplined growth strategy through originating transactions with large customers and by acquiring and developing additional generating facilities when desirable to support our merchant energy business 
our merchant energy business will focus on long term  high value sales of energy  capacity  and related products to large customers  including distribution utilities  industrial customers  and large commercial customers primarily in the regional markets in which end use customer electricity rates have been deregulated and thereby separated from the cost of generation supply 
these markets include the new england region  the new york region  the mid atlantic region  texas  illinois  california  and certain areas in canada 
the growth of bge and our other retail energy services businesses is expected through focused and disciplined expansion primarily from new customers 
customer choice  regulatory change  and energy market conditions significantly impact our business 
in response  we regularly evaluate our strategies with these goals in mind to improve our competitive position  to anticipate and adapt to business environment and regulatory changes  and to maintain a strong balance sheet and investment grade credit quality 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  we undertook a number of initiatives to reduce our costs towards competitive levels and to ensure that our resources are focused on our core energy businesses 
this included the implementation of workforce reduction programs  termination of all planned development projects not under construction  and the acceleration of our exit strategy for certain non core assets 
we also might consider one or more of the following strategies the complete or partial separation of bge s transmission function from its distribution function  mergers or acquisitions of utility or non utility businesses or assets  and sale of assets or one or more businesses 
business environment general industry the utility industry and energy markets continue to experience significant changes as a result of less liquid and more volatile wholesale markets  deteriorating credit qualities of various industry participants  volatile power and fuel prices  excess generation in the domestic markets  and the slow recovery of the us economy 
due to market conditions in  we canceled our separation plans and terminated our power business services agreement with goldman sachs on october  and decided to maintain our existing corporate structure 
we also terminated all planned development projects not under construction 
separately  we initiated efforts to reduce costs in order to become more competitive and to sell certain non core assets to focus attention and capital resources on our core energy businesses 
during  the energy markets were affected by significant events  including expanded investigations by state and federal authorities into business practices of energy companies in the deregulated power and gas markets relating to wash trading to inflate revenues and volumes  and other trading practices allegedly designed to manipulate market prices 
in addition  several merchant energy businesses significantly reduced their energy trading activities due to deteriorating credit quality 
beginning in the second quarter of  several regional energy markets experienced a significant decline in liquidity 
as a result of the reduced market liquidity  our origination and risk management operation held energy positions in certain markets longer than it otherwise would have during the first half of in response to this reduced market liquidity  we reduced these positions and continue to modify our positions to reflect the underlying liquidity of the various regional energy markets 
as discussed above  certain companies in the energy industry have been experiencing deteriorating credit quality 
we continue to actively manage our credit portfolio to attempt to reduce the impact of a potential counterparty default 
we discuss our counterparty credit risk in more detail in the market risk section 
we also continue to examine plans to achieve our strategies and to further strengthen our balance sheet and enhance our liquidity 
we discuss our strategies in the strategy section 
we discuss our liquidity in the financial condition section 
electric competition we are facing competition in the sale of electricity in wholesale power markets and to retail customers 
maryland as a result of the deregulation of electric generation in maryland  the following occurred effective july  all customers can choose their electric energy supplier 
bge provides fixed price standard offer service over various time periods for different classes of customers that do not select an alternative supplier until june  while bge does not sell electric commodity to all customers in its service territory  bge does deliver electricity to all customers and provides meter reading  billing  emergency response  regular maintenance  and balancing services 
bge provides a market rate standard offer service for those commercial and industrial customers who are no longer eligible for fixed price standard offer service until june  bge reduced residential base rates by approximately on average  or about million a year  from rates prior to july  these rates will not change before july while total residential base rates remain unchanged over this transition period july  through june   the increase in the standard offer service rate is offset by a corresponding decrease in the competitive transition charge ctc that bge receives from its customers 
commercial and industrial customers have several service options that will fix electric energy rates through june  and transition charges through june  bge transferred  at book value  its nuclear generating assets  its nuclear decommissioning trust fund  and related assets and liabilities to calvert cliffs nuclear power plant  inc in addition  bge transferred  at book value  its fossil generating assets and related assets and liabilities and its partial ownership interest in two coal plants and a hydroelectric plant located in pennsylvania to constellation power source generation 
our origination and risk management operation provides bge with of the energy and capacity required to meet its standard offer service obligations through june  our origination and risk management operation obtains the energy and capacity to supply bge s standard offer service obligations from affiliates that own calvert cliffs and bge s former fossil plants  supplemented with energy and capacity purchased from the wholesale market  as necessary 
in august  bge entered into contracts with our origination and risk management operation to supply and allegheny energy supply company  llc allegheny to supply the remaining of bge s standard offer service for the final three years july  to june  of the transition period 
currently  the credit ratings of allegheny are below investment grade 
under the terms of the contract  in certain circumstances  bge has the right to request additional credit support from allegheny to secure performance under the contract 
if bge was to exercise these rights and allegheny did not meet such request  bge could liquidate and terminate the contract 
as of the date of this report  allegheny is in compliance with the terms of the contract 
bge s and other maryland utilities role in providing electricity supply to customers is currently the subject of a proceeding at the maryland psc 
specifically  bge entered into a proposed settlement agreement with parties representing customers  industry  utilities  suppliers  the maryland energy administration  the maryland psc s staff  and the office of people s counsel that extends bge s obligation to supply standard offer service 
under the proposed settlement agreement  bge would be obligated to provide market based standard offer service to residential customers until june   and for commercial and industrial customers for a one  two or four year period beyond june   depending on customer size 
the rates charged during this time would be fixed during the term of the supply contract and would include an administrative fee 
the proposed settlement agreement currently is before the maryland psc for approval 
other states several states  other than maryland  have supported deregulation of the electric industry 
the pace of deregulation in other states varies based on historical moves to competition and responses to recent market events 
certain states that were considering deregulation have slowed their plans or postponed consideration 
in response to regional market differences and to promote competitive markets  the ferc proposed initiatives promoting the formation of regional transmission organizations and a standard market design 
if approved  these market changes could provide additional opportunities for our merchant energy business 
we discuss these initiatives in the ferc regulation regional transmission organizations and standard market design section 
as a result of ongoing litigation before the ferc regarding sales into the spot markets of the california independent system operator and power exchange  we estimate that we may be required to pay refunds of between and million for transactions that we entered into with these entities for the period between october and june however  our estimate is based on current information and because litigation is ongoing  new events could occur that could cause the actual amount  if any  to be materially different from our estimate 
gas competition currently  no regulation exists for the wholesale price of natural gas as a commodity  and the regulation of interstate transmission at the federal level has been reduced 
all bge gas customers have the option to purchase gas from other suppliers 
regulation by the maryland psc in addition to electric restructuring which was discussed earlier  regulation by the maryland psc influences bge s businesses 
the maryland psc determines the rates that bge can charge customers for the electric distribution and gas businesses 
the maryland psc incorporates into bge s electric rates the transmission rates determined by ferc 
prior to july   bge s regulated electric rates consisted primarily of a base rate and a fuel rate 
bge unbundled its electric rates to show separate components for delivery service  competitive transition charges  standard offer services generation  transmission  universal service  and taxes 
the rates for bge s regulated gas business continue to consist of a base rate and a fuel rate 
base rate the base rate is the rate the maryland psc allows bge to charge its customers for the cost of providing them service  plus a profit 
bge has both an electric base rate and a gas base rate 
higher electric base rates apply during the summer when the demand for electricity is higher 
gas base rates are not affected by seasonal changes 
bge may ask the maryland psc to increase base rates from time to time 
the maryland psc historically has allowed bge to increase base rates to recover increased utility plant asset costs and higher operating costs  plus a profit  beginning at the time of replacement 
generally  rate increases improve our utility earnings because they allow us to collect more revenue 
however  rate increases are normally granted based on historical data  and those increases may not always keep pace with increasing costs 
other parties may petition the maryland psc to decrease base rates 
on june   the maryland psc authorized a million annual increase in our gas base rates effective june  as a result of the deregulation of electric generation in maryland  bge s residential electric base rates are frozen until electric delivery service rates are frozen until for commercial and industrial customers 
the generation and transmission components of rates are frozen for different time periods depending on the service options selected by those customers 
fuel rate through june   we charged our electric customers separately for the fuel we used to generate electricity nuclear fuel  coal  gas  or oil and for the net cost of purchases and sales of electricity 
we charged the actual cost of these items to the customer with no profit to us 
if these fuel costs increased  the maryland psc generally permitted us to increase the fuel rate 
under deregulation of electric generation  bge s electric fuel rate was frozen until july   at which time the fuel rate clause was discontinued 
we deferred the difference between our actual costs of fuel and energy and what we collected from customers under the fuel rate through june  in september  the maryland psc approved the collection of the million accumulated difference between our actual costs of fuel and energy and the amounts collected from customers that were deferred under the electric fuel rate clause through june  we collected this accumulated difference from customers over the twelve month period ended october effective july   earnings are affected by the changes in the cost of fuel and energy 
we charge our gas customers separately for the natural gas they purchase from us 
the price we charge for the natural gas is based on a market based rates incentive mechanism approved by the maryland psc 
we discuss market based rates and a current proceeding with the maryland psc in more detail in the gas cost adjustments section and in note ferc regulation regional transmission organizations and standard market design in december  ferc issued order  amending its regulations under the federal power act to advance the formation of regional transmission organizations rtos that would allow easier access to transmission 
on july   the ferc issued a proposed rulemaking regarding implementation of a standard market design smd for wholesale electric markets 
the smd rulemaking is intended to complement the ferc s rto order  and will require rtos to substantially comply with its provisions 
the smd proposal requires transmission providers to turn over the operation of their facilities to an independent operator that will operate them consistent with a revised market structure proposed by the ferc 
according to the ferc  the revised market structure will reduce inefficiencies caused by inconsistent market rules and barriers to transmission access 
the ferc proposed that its rule be implemented in stages by october  comments on the smd proposal were submitted in february however  in early  the ferc announced that it would issue a report on smd and again solicit comments from interested parties 
in  bge turned over the operation of its transmission facilities to pjm  a ferc approved rto  which generally conducts its operations in accordance with ferc standard market design principles 
we believe that the smd proposal may lead to long term benefits for constellation energy and bge because the proposal will promote competition in regions where it is implemented 
however  until the proposal is finalized  we cannot predict its effect on our  or bge s  financial results 
cash management in august  the ferc issued proposed rules for the regulation of cash management practices of a regulated subsidiary of a nonregulated parent 
as currently proposed  we do not believe the proposed rule will have a material effect on our  and bge s  financial results 
we discuss our cash management arrangement in note weather merchant energy business weather conditions in the different regions of north america influence the financial results of our merchant energy business 
weather conditions can affect the supply of and demand for electricity and fuels  and changes in energy supply and demand may impact the price of these energy commodities in both the spot market and the forward market 
typically  demand for electricity and its price are higher in the summer and the winter  when weather is more extreme 
similarly  the demand for and price of natural gas and oil are higher in the winter 
however  all regions of north america typically do not experience extreme weather conditions at the same time 
bge weather affects the demand for electricity and gas for our regulated businesses 
very hot summers and very cold winters increase demand 
mild weather reduces demand 
residential sales for our regulated businesses are impacted more by weather than commercial and industrial sales  which are mostly affected by business needs for electricity and gas 
however  the maryland psc allows us to record a monthly adjustment to our regulated gas business revenues to eliminate the effect of abnormal weather patterns 
we discuss this further in the weather normalization section 
we measure the weather s effect using degree days 
the measure of degree days for a given day is the difference between the average daily actual temperature and a baseline temperature of degrees 
cooling degree days result when the average daily actual temperature exceeds the degree baseline 
heating degree days result when the average daily actual temperature is less than the baseline 
during the cooling season  hotter weather is measured by more cooling degree days and results in greater demand for electricity to operate cooling systems 
during the heating season  colder weather is measured by more heating degree days and results in greater demand for electricity and gas to operate heating systems 
we show the number of cooling and heating degree days in and  the percentage change in the number of degree days from the prior year  and the number of degree days in a normal year as represented by the year average in the following table 
year average cooling degree days  percentage change from prior year heating degree days    percentage change from prior year other factors a number of other factors significantly influence the level and volatility of prices for energy commodities and related derivative products for our merchant energy business 
these factors include seasonal daily and hourly changes in demand  number of market participants  extreme peak demands  available supply resources  transportation availability and reliability within and between regions  procedures used to maintain the integrity of the physical electricity system during extreme conditions  and changes in the nature and extent of federal and state regulations 
these factors can affect energy commodity and derivative prices in different ways and to different degrees 
these effects may vary throughout the country as a result of regional differences in weather conditions  market liquidity  capability and reliability of the physical electricity and gas systems  and the nature and extent of electricity deregulation 
other factors  aside from weather  also impact the demand for electricity and gas in our regulated businesses 
these factors include the number of customers and usage per customer during a given period 
we use these terms later in our discussions of regulated electric and gas operations 
in those sections  we discuss how these and other factors affected electric and gas sales during the periods presented 
the number of customers in a given period is affected by new home and apartment construction and by the number of businesses in our service territory 
usage per customer refers to all other items impacting customer sales that cannot be measured separately 
these factors include the strength of the economy in our service territory 
when the economy is healthy and expanding  customers tend to consume more electricity and gas 
conversely  during an economic downtrend  our customers tend to consume less electricity and gas 
environmental and legal matters you will find details of our environmental matters in note and item business environmental matters section 
you will find details of our legal matters in note some of the information is about costs that may be material to our financial results 
accounting standards adopted and issued we discuss recently adopted and issued accounting standards in note results of operations in this section  we discuss our earnings and the factors affecting them 
we begin with a general overview  then separately discuss net income for our operating segments 
changes in other income  fixed charges and income taxes are discussed in the aggregate for all segments in the consolidated nonoperating income and expenses section 
overview net income in millions net income before special items included in operations merchant energy regulated electric regulated gas other nonregulated net income before special items included in operations special items included in operations net gain on sales of investments and other assets workforce reduction costs impairments of investment in qualifying facilities and domestic power projects costs associated with exit of bge home merchandise stores impairments of real estate  senior living  and international investments contract termination related costs reduction of financial investment deregulation transition cost net income before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net income net income for the periods presented reflect a significant shift from the regulated electric business to the merchant energy business as a result of the transfer of bge s electric generation assets to nonregulated subsidiaries on july  our total net income for increased million  or per share  compared to mostly because of the following we recognized a million after tax gain  or per share  on the sale of our investment in orion as previously discussed in the significant events section 
we recorded special items in that had a negative impact in that year 
we had cost reductions due to productivity initiatives associated with our corporate wide workforce reduction and other productivity programs 
the addition of nine mile point nuclear station nine mile point to the generation fleet increased net income 
we benefited from the absence of goldman sachs fees due to the termination of the power business services agreement in october we had higher mark to market earnings from our origination and risk management operation 
we had higher earnings from our regulated electric business because of warmer summer weather in the central maryland region 
we had higher earnings from the addition of newenergy 
we had higher earnings from our other nonregulated businesses due to the growth of our energy services business and improved results from our international portfolio 
these increases were partially offset by special items recorded in as previously discussed in the significant events section and the following we had higher fixed charges due to the issuance of billion of long term debt that was primarily used to repay short term borrowings and due to lower capitalized interest because of the new generating facilities that commenced operations since mid our merchant energy business had higher purchased fuel costs 
we had lower earnings due to the extended outage at calvert cliffs to replace the steam generators at unit our merchant energy business had lower earnings due to the impact of large commercial and industrial customers leaving bge s standard offer service and electing other generation suppliers resulting in the sale of excess generation at lower wholesale market prices 
our merchant energy business had lower earnings from our investments in qualifying facilities and domestic power projects 
in addition  our other nonregulated businesses recorded the following in that had a positive impact in that period an million after tax  or 
per share  gain for the cumulative effect of adopting sfas no 
 and gains on the sale of securities of million after tax  or 
per share 
earnings per share contributions from all of our business segments are impacted by the dilution resulting from the issuance of million of common shares during our total net income for decreased million  or per share  compared to mostly because the special items included in operations as previously discussed in the significant events section more than offset the million  or 
per share  increase in our net income before special items 
net income before special items was million  or per share  in compared to million  or per share  in net income before special items was higher compared to mostly because bge recorded million pre tax  or approximately 
per share  of amortization expense for the reduction of our generating plants associated with the deregulation of electric generation in that had a negative impact in that year 
in addition  we had higher earnings from our regulated gas business in mostly because of increases in the sharing mechanism under our gas cost adjustment clauses and the increase in our base rates 
these increases were offset by the impact of a annual electric residential rate reduction that was effective july  the decrease in total net income for compared to also was partially offset by the following our merchant energy business recorded in an expense of million after tax  or 
per share  for a deregulation transition cost to goldman sachs that had a negative impact in that year 
bge recorded an expense of million after tax  or 
per share  for its employees that elected to participate in a targeted vserp in that had a negative impact in that year 
we recorded an million after tax  or 
per share  gain for the cumulative effect of adopting sfas no 
in the first quarter of in the following sections  we discuss our net income by business segment in greater detail 
merchant energy business background our merchant energy business is a competitive provider of energy solutions for large customers in north america 
as discussed in the business environment electric competition section  in connection with the july  implementation of customer choice in maryland  bge s generating assets became part of our nonregulated merchant energy business  and our origination and risk management operation began selling to bge the energy and capacity required to meet its standard offer service obligations for the first three years july  to june  of the transition period 
in august  bge entered into a contract with our origination and risk management operation to provide of the energy and capacity required for bge to meet its standard offer service requirements for the final three years july  to june  of the transition period 
also effective july   merchant energy business revenues include of the competitive transition charges ctc revenues bge collects from its customers and the portion of bge s revenues providing for nuclear decommissioning costs 
we record merchant energy revenues and expenses in our financial results in different periods depending upon which portion of our business they affect 
we discuss our revenue recognition policies in the critical accounting policies section and in note we summarize our policies as follows we record revenues as they are earned and electric fuel and purchased energy costs as they are incurred for contracts and activities subject to accrual accounting  including certain load serving activities  as discussed below 
prior to the settlement of the forecasted transaction being hedged  we record changes in the fair value of contracts designated as cash flow hedges in other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedges are effective 
we record the effective portion of the changes in fair value of hedges in earnings in the period the settlement of the hedged transaction occurs 
we record the ineffective portion of the changes in fair value of hedges  if any  in earnings in the period in which the change occurs 
we record changes in the fair value of contracts that are subject to mark to market accounting in revenues on a net basis in the period in which the change occurs 
eitf will affect how we apply the mark to market method of accounting 
we discuss eitf in the critical accounting policies section and in note mark to market accounting requires us to make estimates and assumptions using judgment in determining the fair value of our contracts and in recording revenues from those contracts 
we discuss the effects of mark to market accounting on our revenues in the competitive supply mark to market revenues section 
we discuss mark to market accounting and the accounting policies for the merchant energy business further in the critical accounting policies section and in note as a result of the changes in our organization and senior management in late  including the cancellation of our business separation and the termination of the power business services agreement with goldman sachs  we re evaluated our load serving activities in texas and new england as discussed in more detail in the competitive supply section 
we determined that since we manage these activities as a physical delivery business rather than a trading business  it is appropriate to apply accrual accounting for these activities 
after the re designation of existing contracts to non trading  we began to record revenues and expenses on a gross basis  but this did not have a material impact on earnings because the resulting increase in revenues was accompanied by a similar increase in fuel and purchased energy expenses 
as a result of applying accrual accounting to an increasing portion of our merchant energy business  including the january  implementation of eitf  future mark to market earnings will be lower than they otherwise would have been because we will record the margin on new transactions as power is delivered to customers over the contract term using accrual accounting rather than in full at the inception of each new contract 
however  we expect accrual earnings for to be million higher than they would have been prior to applying eitf  reflecting the portion of the fair value of contracts converted to accrual accounting using market prices as of december  while we cannot predict the ongoing impact of applying eitf  the timing of recognizing earnings on new transactions will change 
in general  earnings on new transactions will no longer be recognized at the inception of the transactions under mark to market accounting because they will be recognized over the term of the transaction 
however  we cannot predict the total impact of these changes on our earnings for the reasons discussed in the critical accounting policies section 
additionally  we also expect lower earnings volatility for this portion of our business because unrealized changes in the fair value of load serving contracts will no longer be recorded as revenue at the time of the change under mark to market accounting as is required for trading activities 
any contracts subject to eitf must be accounted for on the accrual basis and recorded gross rather than net upon application of eitf  which was effective after october  for new non derivative transactions including spot market purchases and sales and january  for contracts existing as of october  our merchant energy business results were as follows net income in millions revenues    fuel and purchased energy expenses  operations and maintenance expenses workforce reduction costs impairment losses and other costs contract termination related costs depreciation and amortization taxes other than income taxes net loss on sales of assets income from operations net income net income before special items included in operations workforce reduction costs impairment of investments in qualifying facilities and domestic power projects net loss on sales of assets contract termination related costs deregulation transition cost net income above amounts include intercompany transactions eliminated in our consolidated financial statements 
note provides a reconciliation of operating results by segment to our consolidated financial statements 
revenues and fuel and purchased energy expenses our origination and risk management operation manages our costs of procuring fuel and energy and revenues we realize from the sale of energy to our customers 
the difference between revenues and fuel and purchased energy expenses is the primary driver of the profitability of our merchant energy business 
accordingly  we believe it is appropriate to discuss the operating results of our merchant energy business by analyzing the changes in the relationship between revenues and fuel and purchased energy expenses 
we discuss non fuel direct costs  such as ancillary services  transmission costs  financing  and legal costs in conjunction with other operations and maintenance expenses later in this section 
we analyze our merchant energy revenues and fuel and purchased energy expenses in the following categories because of differences in the revenue sources  the nature of fuel and purchased energy expenses  and the risk profile of each category 
pjm platform our fossil  nuclear  and hydroelectric generating facilities and load serving activities in the pjm interconnection pjm region for which the output is primarily used to serve bge 
plants with power purchase agreements our generating facilities with long term power purchase agreements  including our nine mile point nuclear generating facility and our new oleander and university park generating facilities 
competitive supply our wholesale business that provides load serving activities to distribution utilities primarily in texas and new england  other wholesale origination and risk management services  and electric and gas retail energy services to large commercial and industrial customers 
other our other gas fired generating facilities  investments in qualifying facilities and domestic power projects  and our generation and consulting services 
we provide a summary of our revenues and fuel and purchased energy expenses as follows dollar amounts in millions revenues pjm platform   plants with power purchase agreements competitive supply other total    fuel and purchased energy expenses pjm platform plants with power purchase agreements competitive supply other total  revenue less fuel and purchased energy expenses of total of total of total pjm platform plants with power purchase agreements competitive supply other total   pjm platform in millions revenues   fuel and purchased energy expenses revenues less fuel and purchased energy revenues bge standard offer service the majority of pjm platform revenues arise from bge standard offer service 
revenues from bge s standard offer service requirements decreased million  including ctc and decommissioning revenues that decreased million  in compared to these decreases were due to approximately  megawatts of large commercial and industrial customers leaving bge s standard offer service in the second quarter of and electing other electric generation suppliers  partially offset by higher volumes sold to bge due to warmer summer weather 
however  approximately one third of the load for large commercial and industrial customers left bge s standard offer service and elected bge home  a subsidiary of constellation energy  as their electric generation supplier 
our merchant energy business continues to provide the energy to bge home to meet the requirements of these customers under market based rates 
revenues from bge home were million in bge home is included in our other nonregulated businesses 
ctc revenues are impacted by the ctc rates our merchant energy business receives from bge customers as well as the volumes delivered to bge customers 
the ctc rates decline over the transition period as previously discussed in the electric competition maryland section 
revenues from bge s standard offer service requirements increased million  including ctc and decommissioning revenues that increased million  in compared to because our merchant energy business provided bge s standard offer service requirements for a full year in as compared to six months in other pjm revenues other merchant energy revenues in the pjm region decreased million in compared to mostly because of the following the sales of power from our owned generation in excess of that required to serve bge s standard offer service requirements decreased million compared to these sales decreased primarily due to lower generation because of the extended outage at calvert cliffs in order to replace the steam generators at unit and lower generation from our coal plants partially offset by higher revenues due to warmer summer weather 
our merchant energy business recognized a million gain on the sale of a project under development in this region in that had a positive impact in that year 
other merchant energy revenues in the pjm region increased million in compared to mostly because of the following the sales of power from our baltimore plants in excess of that required to serve bge s standard offer service requirements increased million 
our merchant energy business recognized a million gain on the sale of a project under development in the pjm region in march the handsome lake generating facility that commenced operations in provided revenues of million 
fuel and purchased energy expenses our merchant energy business had higher fuel and purchased energy expenses in the pjm region in compared to primarily due to higher replacement power costs from the extended outage at calvert cliffs and higher coal prices 
these were partially offset by lower generation at our coal plants 
our merchant energy business began an extended outage at unit of calvert cliffs during the first quarter of to replace the unit s steam generators  which was completed at the end of june as a result  our merchant energy business had lower revenues and higher operating costs  including higher purchased energy to meet bge s standard offer service 
calvert cliffs will replace the steam generators for unit during the refueling outage 
based on our current outage schedule  we expect the outage to be shorter than the extended outage 
however  this outage will be significantly longer than a normal refueling outage 
we expect lower annual revenues and higher annual operating costs in from calvert cliffs compared to due to the longer outage 
our merchant energy business had higher fuel and purchased energy expenses in the pjm region in compared to mostly because reflects a full year s operation of the generation plants that were transferred from bge effective july  the fuel cost increase also reflects higher fuel prices for generating electricity mostly because coal prices increased during compared to plants with power purchase agreements in millions revenues fuel and purchased energy expenses revenues less fuel and purchased energy the increases in revenues and expenses primarily were due to a full year s results from nine mile point  which we acquired in november  and the university park generating facility  which commenced operations in the second half of in addition  the oleander generating facility commenced operations in the second half of competitive supply in millions accrual revenues mark to market revenues fuel and purchased energy expenses revenues less fuel and purchased energy we analyze our accrual and mark to market competitive supply activities separately below 
accrual revenues and fuel and purchased energy expenses our accrual revenues and fuel and purchased energy expenses increased in primarily due to the re designation of our texas and new england load serving activities to accrual and the acquisition of newenergy in september texas and new england revenues were million  and purchased energy expenses were million 
newenergy s revenues were million  and purchased energy expenses were million 
we discuss the re designation of texas and new england below 
since february  we manage our texas load serving activities as a physical delivery business separate from our trading activities and re designated these activities as non trading 
we believe this designation more accurately reflects the substance of our texas load serving physical delivery activities 
at the time of this change in designation  we reclassified the fair value of load serving contracts and physically delivering power purchase agreements in texas from mark to market energy assets and liabilities to other assets and liabilities 
the contracts reclassified consisted of gross assets of million and gross liabilities of million  or a net asset of million 
eitf required us to remove the unamortized balance of these assets and liabilities  excluding the costs of any acquired contracts  from our consolidated balance sheets by january  after the change in designation  the results of our texas load serving business are included in nonregulated revenues on a gross basis as power is delivered to our customers and operating expenses as costs are incurred 
prior to the re designation  the results of these activities were reported on a net basis as part of mark to market revenues included in nonregulated revenues 
mark to market revenues for the texas trading activities were a net loss of million for the portion of prior to designation as non trading 
mark to market revenues for the texas trading activities were a net loss of million in since future power sales revenues and costs from this business will be reflected in our consolidated statements of income as part of nonregulated revenues when power is delivered and operating expenses when the costs are incurred  this re designation generally will delay the recognition of earnings from this business in the future compared to what we would have recognized under mark to market accounting 
the change in designation of our texas load serving business did not impact our cash flows 
in addition  our new england load serving business consists primarily of contracts to serve the full energy and capacity requirements of retail customers and electric distribution utilities and associated power purchase agreements to supply our customers requirements 
we manage this business primarily to assure profitable delivery of customers energy requirements rather than as a traditional trading activity 
therefore  we use accrual accounting for new england load serving transactions and associated power purchase agreements entered into since the second quarter of because applicable accounting rules significantly limited the circumstances under which contracts previously designated as a trading activity could be re designated as non trading  prior to eitf  we were required to continue to include contracts entered into before the second quarter of in our mark to market accounting portfolio 
however  under eitf  on january   we removed these contracts from our mark to market energy assets and liabilities and began to account for these contracts under the accrual method of accounting 
we discuss the implications of eitf in more detail in the critical accounting policies section and in note mark to market revenues mark to market revenues include net gains and losses from origination and risk management activities for which we use the mark to market method of accounting 
we discuss these activities and the mark to market method of accounting in more detail in the critical accounting policies section and in note we also discuss the implications of eitf on the mark to market method of accounting in the critical accounting policies section and in note as a result of the nature of our operations and the use of mark to market accounting for certain activities  mark to market revenues and earnings will fluctuate 
we cannot predict these fluctuations  but the impact on our revenues and earnings could be material 
we discuss our market risk in more detail in the market risk section 
the primary factors that cause fluctuations in our mark to market revenues and earnings are the number  size  and profitability of new transactions  changes in the level and volatility of forward commodity prices and interest rates  changes in estimates of customers load requirements as a result of changes in weather and customer attrition due to the selection of other suppliers  and the number and size of our open derivative positions 
mark to market revenues were as follows in millions unrealized revenues origination transactions risk management unrealized changes in fair value changes in valuation techniques reclassification of settled contracts to realized total risk management total unrealized revenues realized revenues total mark to market revenues revenues from origination transactions represent the initial unrealized fair value of new wholesale energy transactions including restructurings at the time of contract execution to the extent permitted by applicable accounting rules 
risk management revenues represent both realized and unrealized gains and losses from changes in the value of our entire portfolio 
we discuss the changes in mark to market revenues below 
we show the relationship between our revenues and the change in our net mark to market energy asset later in this section 
our mark to market revenues were and continue to be affected by a decrease in the portion of our activities that is subject to mark to market accounting 
as previously discussed  we re designated our texas load serving business as accrual during  and we began to account for new non derivative origination transactions on the accrual basis rather than under mark to market accounting 
under eitf  we no longer record existing non derivative contracts at fair value beginning january  further  effective july   to the extent that we are not able to observe quoted market prices or other current market transactions for contract values determined using models  we record a reserve to adjust such contracts to result in zero gain or loss at inception 
we remove the reserve and record such contracts at fair value when we obtain current market information for contracts with similar terms and counterparties 
mark to market revenues increased million during compared to mostly because of net gains from risk management activities compared to net losses in the prior year  partially offset by lower revenues from origination transactions 
the increase in risk management revenues is primarily due to the absence of mark to market losses recorded in on texas trading activities designated as non trading in  favorable changes in regional power prices  price volatility  and other factors in compared to the decrease in origination revenues reflects the use of accrual accounting for new load serving transactions originated beginning in the second quarter of  the impact of applying the eitf guidance on recording gains at the time of contract origination as previously described  and fewer individually significant transactions in as compared to mark to market revenues increased million during compared to mostly because of higher revenues from new origination transactions  partially offset by net losses from risk management activities 
the increase in origination revenues reflects new full requirements load serving transaction volumes  primarily in new england and texas 
the increase in risk management net losses is primarily due to decreases in both future power prices and price volatility in and costs of establishing hedges for new origination transactions 
the decrease in forward prices and volatility negatively affected the mark to market value of our portfolio of supply arrangements 
however  these mark to market losses were more than offset by mark to market gains in the form of new origination transactions that were in part enabled by these supply arrangements 
mark to market energy assets and liabilities our mark to market energy assets and liabilities are comprised of a combination of derivative and non derivative physical contracts 
the non derivative assets and liabilities primarily relate to load serving activities originated prior to the shift to accrual accounting earlier this year 
while some of these contracts represent commodities or instruments for which prices are available from external sources  other commodities and certain contracts are not actively traded and are valued using other pricing sources and modeling techniques to determine expected future market prices  contract quantities  or both 
we discuss our modeling techniques later in this section 
mark to market energy assets and liabilities consisted of the following at december  in millions current assets noncurrent assets   total assets   current liabilities noncurrent liabilities  total liabilities  net mark to market energy asset at december   the primary components of our net mark to market energy asset were as follows in millions non derivative contracts reversed as part of cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle effective january  derivatives designated as hedges effective january  derivatives designated as normal purchases and sales effective january  other positions total the non derivative portion of the net asset represents the fair value of contracts that we reclassified to accrual effective january  as required by eitf derivatives designated as hedges effective january  represent derivative contracts used to hedge our physical delivery contracts in connection with the implementation of eitf derivatives designated as normal purchases and sales effective january   represent derivative contracts used to economically hedge our physical delivery contracts in connection with the implementation of eitf but which receive accrual accounting treatment 
the remainder of the net asset primarily consists of a pjm generation hedge comprised of a group of options that serve as an economic hedge of the pjm generation portfolio 
these options give us the right to sell power at a floor price which is valuable to our generation operation when market prices are low and also give us the right to buy power at a capped price  which adds value when the market prices are high 
we have not designated these options as hedges under sfas no 
due to the complexity of qualifying options as effective hedges under the requirements of that standard 
the following are the primary sources of the change in net mark to market energy asset during and in millions fair value beginning of year changes in fair value recorded as revenues origination transactions unrealized changes in fair value changes in valuation techniques reclassification of settled contracts to realized total changes in fair value recorded as revenues changes in fair value recorded as operating expenses changes in value of exchange listed futures and options net change in premiums on options texas contracts re designated as non trading other changes in fair value fair value at end of year changes in the net mark to market energy asset that affected revenues were as follows origination transactions represent the initial unrealized fair value at the time these contracts are executed 
unrealized changes in fair value represent unrealized changes in commodity prices  the volatility of options on commodities  the time value of options  and other valuation adjustments 
changes in valuation techniques represent improvements in estimation techniques  including modeling and other statistical enhancements used to value our portfolio to reflect more accurately the economic value of our contracts 
reclassification of settled contracts to realized represents the portion of previously unrealized amounts settled during the period and recorded as realized revenues 
the net mark to market energy asset also changed due to the following items recorded in accounts other than revenue changes in fair value recorded as operating expenses represent accruals for future incremental expenses in connection with servicing origination transactions 
while these accruals are recorded as part of the fair value of the net mark to market energy asset  they are reflected in our consolidated statements of income as expenses rather than revenues 
changes in value of exchange listed futures and options are adjustments to remove unrealized revenue from exchange traded contracts that are included in risk management revenues 
the fair value of these contracts is recorded in accounts receivable rather than mark to market energy assets in our consolidated balance sheets because these amounts are settled through our margin account with a third party broker 
net changes in premiums on options reflects the accounting for premiums on options purchased as an increase in the net mark to market energy asset and premiums on options sold as a decrease in the net mark to market energy asset 
we discuss our texas contracts re designated as non trading in more detail in the competitive supply section 
the settlement terms of the net mark to market energy asset and sources of fair value as of december  are as follows settlement term fair value thereafter in millions prices provided by external sources prices based on models total net mark to market energy asset includes contracts actively quoted and contracts valued from other external sources 
the implementation of eitf significantly impacted the amount and composition of the net mark to market energy asset 
the table below presents the settlement terms of our net mark to market energy asset as of january  after reflecting the impact of implementing eitf we discuss eitf and the effect of its implementation in more detail in the critical accounting policies section and in note settlement term after reflecting implementation of eitf thereafter fair value in millions prices provided by external sources prices based on models total net mark to market energy asset we manage our mark to market risk on a portfolio basis based upon the delivery period of our contracts and the individual components of the risks within each contract 
accordingly  we record and manage the energy purchase and sale obligations under our contracts in separate components based upon the commodity eg  electricity or gas  the product eg  electricity for delivery during peak or off peak hours  the delivery location eg  by region  the risk profile eg  forward or option  and the delivery period eg  by month and year 
consistent with our risk management practices  we have presented the information in the tables above based upon the ability to obtain reliable prices for components of the risks in our contracts from external sources rather than on a contract by contract basis 
thus  the portion of long term contracts that is valued using external price sources is presented under the caption prices provided by external sources 
this is consistent with how we manage our risk  and we believe it provides the best indication of the basis for the valuation of our portfolio 
since we manage our risk on a portfolio basis rather than contract by contract  it is not practicable to determine separately the portion of long term contracts that is included in each valuation category 
we describe the commodities  products  and delivery periods included in each valuation category in detail below 
the amounts for which fair value is determined using prices provided by external sources represent the portion of forward  swap  and option contracts for which price quotations are available through brokers or over the counter transactions 
the term for which such price information is available varies by commodity  region  and product 
the fair values included in this category are the following portions of our contracts forward purchases and sales of electricity during peak hours for delivery terms primarily through  but up to  depending upon the region  forward purchases and sales of electricity during off peak hours for delivery terms primarily through  but up to  depending upon the region  options for the purchase and sale of electricity during peak hours for delivery terms through  depending upon the region  forward purchases and sales of electric capacity for delivery terms through  forward purchases and sales of natural gas  coal and oil for delivery terms through  and options for the purchase and sale of natural gas  coal and oil for delivery terms through the remainder of the net mark to market energy asset is valued using models 
the portion of contracts for which such techniques are used includes standard products for which external prices are not available and customized products that are valued using modeling techniques to determine expected future market prices  contract quantities  or both 
modeling techniques include estimating the present value of cash flows based upon underlying contractual terms and incorporate  where appropriate  option pricing models and statistical and simulation procedures 
inputs to the models include observable market prices  estimated market prices in the absence of quoted market prices  the risk free market discount rate  volatility factors  estimated correlation of energy commodity prices  estimated volumes for customer requirements  which are influenced by customer switching behavior  impact of temperature on electric prices  and customer acquisition and servicing costs  estimated volumes for tolling contracts  and expected generation profiles of specific regions 
additionally  we incorporate counterparty specific credit quality and factors for market price and volatility uncertainty and other risks in our valuation 
the inputs and factors used to determine fair value reflect management s best estimates 
the electricity  fuel  and other energy contracts we hold have varying terms to maturity  ranging from contracts for delivery the next hour to contracts with terms of ten years or more 
because an active  liquid electricity futures market comparable to that for other commodities has not developed  the majority of contracts used in the origination and risk management operation are direct contracts between market participants and are not exchange traded or financially settling contracts that can be readily liquidated in their entirety through an exchange or other market mechanism 
consequently  we and other market participants generally realize the value of these contracts as cash flows become due or payable under the terms of the contracts rather than through selling or liquidating the contracts themselves 
consistent with our risk management practices  the amounts shown in the tables on the previous page as being valued using prices from external sources include the portion of long term contracts for which we can obtain reliable prices from external sources 
the remaining portions of these long term contracts are shown in the tables as being valued using models 
in order to realize the entire value of a long term contract in a single transaction  we would need to sell or assign the entire contract 
if we were to sell or assign any of our long term contracts in their entirety  we may not realize the entire value reflected in the tables 
however  based upon the nature of the origination and risk management operation  we expect to realize the value of these contracts  as well as any contracts we may enter into in the future to manage our risk  over time as the contracts and related hedges settle in accordance with their terms 
we do not expect to realize the value of these contracts and related hedges by selling or assigning the contracts themselves in total 
the fair values in the tables represent expected future cash flows based on the level of forward prices and volatility factors as of december  and could change significantly as a result of future changes in these factors 
additionally  because the depth and liquidity of the power markets varies substantially between regions and time periods  the prices used to determine fair value could be affected significantly by the volume of transactions executed 
management uses its best estimates to determine the fair value of commodity and derivative contracts it holds and sells 
these estimates consider various factors including closing exchange and over the counter price quotations  time value  volatility factors  and credit exposure 
however  future market prices and actual quantities will vary from those used in recording mark to market energy assets and liabilities  and it is possible that such variations could be material 
other in millions revenues fuel and purchased energy expenses revenues less fuel and purchased energy we analyze the revenues and fuel and purchased energy expenses of the final category of our merchant energy business below 
revenues our other merchant energy business revenues decreased in compared to mostly because we had lower revenues of million from our mid continent region facilities that commenced operations in mid summer of primarily due to lower output from these facilities because of a less favorable relationship between energy prices and gas costs 
in addition  we had lower revenues of million from our investments in qualifying facilities and domestic power projects 
we discuss our investments in qualifying facilities and domestic power projects in more detail on the next page 
our other merchant energy business revenues decreased in compared to mostly because of the following our merchant energy business had lower revenues of million from our investments in qualifying facilities and domestic power projects 
our merchant energy business terminated an operating arrangement and sold certain subsidiaries of constellation operating services inc cosi to orion in cosi ended its exclusive arrangement with orion to operate orion s facilities  and orion purchased from cosi the four subsidiary companies formed to operate power plants owned by orion 
our merchant energy business recognized a million gain on this sale in which had a positive impact on that year  and the absence of million of revenues during compared to due to the sale of these subsidiaries 
these lower revenues were partially offset by higher revenues of million from our mid continent region gas fired peaking facilities that commenced operations in mid summer of investments in qualifying facilities and domestic power projects our merchant energy business holds up to a ownership interest in operating domestic energy projects that consist of electric generation  fuel processing  or fuel handling facilities 
of these projects  are qualifying facilities that receive certain exemptions and pricing under the public utility regulatory policy act of based on the facilities energy source or the use of a cogeneration process 
earnings from our investments were million in  million in  and million in the decrease in revenues in compared to was due to a geothermal project generating at a lower capacity and lower revenues from our california projects as discussed below 
the decrease in revenues in compared to was primarily due to lower revenues from our california projects 
california power purchase agreements our merchant energy business has million invested in partnerships that own operating power projects of which our ownership percentage represents megawatts of electricity that are sold to pacific gas electric pge and to southern california edison sce in california under power purchase agreements 
our merchant energy business was not paid in full for its sales from these plants to the two utilities from november through early april at december   our portion of the amount due for unpaid power sales from these utilities was approximately million 
we recorded reserves of approximately of this amount in through the date of this report  we received the million for unpaid power sales plus interest 
we reversed all of our credit reserves that totaled million during the first quarter of as payments ensued following court approved restructuring agreements 
revenues from these projects  net of credit reserves  were million in  million in  and million in while california power prices were significantly lower during compared to  results were reduced by credit reserves established for our exposure in california 
these reserves were subsequently reversed in as discussed above  which had a positive impact in revenues decreased in compared to because of lower power prices in california during the second half of while energy rates were higher during the first half of  the higher rates were offset by reserves established for our exposure in california during that year 
the projects entered into agreements with pge through july and sce through april that provide for fixed price payments averaging per megawatt hour plus the stated capacity payments in the original agreements 
fuel and purchased energy expenses our other merchant energy business fuel and purchased energy expenses decreased in compared to mostly because we had lower fuel and purchased energy for our mid continent region facilities primarily due to lower demand for the output of these facilities 
operations and maintenance expenses our merchant energy business operations and maintenance expenses increased million in compared to mostly due to the following higher operations and maintenance expenses of million associated with the acquisitions of nine mile point in november and newenergy in september higher operations and maintenance expenses of million associated with new generating facilities that commenced operations beginning in mid and mid these increases were partially offset by the following lower costs of approximately million due to productivity initiatives associated with our corporate wide workforce reduction and other productivity programs 
lower origination and risk management operating expenses of million as a result of the absence of goldman sachs fees due to the termination of the power business services agreement in october the goldman sachs fees were million in this decrease was partially offset by an increase in expenses associated with the growth of the operation 
our merchant energy business operations and maintenance expenses increased million in compared to mostly due to the following higher operations and maintenance expenses of million mostly because reflects a full year s operation of the generation plants that were transferred from bge effective july higher operations and maintenance expenses of million associated with the acquisitions of nine mile point in november higher operations and maintenance expenses of million associated with new generating facilities that commenced operations beginning in mid higher origination and risk management operating expenses of million as a result of the growth of the operation and higher direct expenses primarily due to higher transaction volumes 
these increases were partially offset by the following the decrease in the goldman sachs fees of million due to the termination of the power business services agreement in october the goldman sachs fee was million in  which included the million  or 
per share  deregulation transition cost 
lower operations and maintenance expenses at cosi of million due to the sale of certain subsidiaries as previously discussed 
workforce reduction costs  impairment losses and other costs  contract termination related costs  and net loss on sales of assets our merchant energy business recognized the following in million of expenses associated with our workforce reduction efforts  million of impairment losses for the decline in value of certain investments in partnerships that have investments in qualifying facilities and domestic power projects  million loss on the sale of a steam turbine generator set  and million gain on the sale of cabazon  a wind powered independent power project located in california 
our merchant energy business recognized the following in million of expenses related to the termination of the power business services agreement with goldman sachs  million of expenses associated with our workforce reduction efforts  million of impairment losses of certain planned development projects that were terminated  and million loss on the impairment of a power project 
we discuss these special items in more detail in the significant events section and in note as a result of our workforce reduction programs and other process improvement initiatives  our merchant energy business expects to realize cost savings of approximately million partially offset by other increases in operating costs in depreciation and amortization expense merchant energy depreciation and amortization expense increased million in compared to mostly because of the depreciation and amortization associated with nine mile point and the new generating facilities 
merchant energy depreciation and amortization expense increased million in compared to mostly because includes a full year of expenses associated with the generation plants that were transferred from bge effective july  additionally  expenses include depreciation and amortization associated with the new generating facilities and nine mile point 
taxes other than income taxes merchant energy taxes other than income taxes increased million in compared to mostly because of taxes other than income taxes associated with nine mile point and the new generating facilities 
merchant energy taxes other than income taxes increased million in compared to mostly because of taxes other than income taxes associated with the generation plants that were transferred from bge effective july  additionally  expenses include taxes other than income taxes associated with nine mile point and the new generating facilities 
regulated electric business as previously discussed  our regulated electric business was significantly impacted by the july  implementation of customer choice 
these changes include bge s generating assets and related liabilities becoming part of our nonregulated merchant energy business on that date 
effective july   bge unbundled its rates to show separate components for delivery service  transition charges  standard offer services generation  transmission  universal service  and taxes 
bge s rates also were frozen in total except for the implementation of a residential base rate reduction totaling approximately million annually 
in addition  of the ctc revenues bge collects and the portion of its revenues providing for decommissioning costs  are included in revenues of the merchant energy business 
as part of the deregulation of electric generation  while total rates were frozen over the transition period  the increasing rates received from customers under the standard offer service are offset by declining ctc rates 
net income in millions revenues    fuel and purchased energy expenses   operations and maintenance expenses workforce reduction costs depreciation and amortization taxes other than income taxes income from operations net income net income before special items included in operations workforce reduction costs net income above amounts include intercompany transactions eliminated in our consolidated financial statements 
note provides a reconciliation of operating results by segment to our consolidated financial statements 
net income from the regulated electric business increased in compared to mostly because of the following increased distribution sales volumes due to warmer summer weather  increased usage per customer  and an increased number of customers  cost reductions resulting from our corporate wide workforce reduction programs and other productivity initiatives  and lower interest expense 
net income from the regulated electric business decreased in compared to mostly because of the july  deregulation of electric generation as discussed later in this section 
electric revenues the changes in electric revenues in and compared to the respective prior year were caused by in millions distribution sales volumes standard offer service fuel rate surcharge total change in electric revenues from electric system sales interchange and other sales other total change in electric revenues distribution sales volumes distribution sales volumes are sales to customers in bge s service territory at rates set by the maryland psc 
the percentage changes in our electric system sales volumes  by type of customer  in and compared to the respective prior year were residential commercial industrial in  we distributed more electricity to residential and commercial customers compared to due to warmer summer weather  increased usage per customer  and an increased number of customers 
we distributed about the same amount of electricity to industrial customers in compared to in  we distributed about the same amount of electricity to all customer classes compared to due primarily to milder winter weather offset by an increased number of customers 
standard offer service bge provides standard offer service for customers that do not select an alternative generation supplier as previously discussed 
standard offer service revenues decreased in compared to primarily as a result of large commercial and industrial customers leaving bge s standard offer service and electing other electric generation suppliers 
these decreased revenues were partially offset by increased sales to residential customers due to warmer summer weather and an increase in the standard offer service rate that bge charges its customers 
as a result of large commercial and industrial customers leaving bge s service  bge also had lower purchased energy expense as discussed in the electric fuel and purchased energy expenses section 
standard offer service revenues decreased in compared to mostly due to the annual residential rate reduction of million recorded through june   and million of higher ctc and decommissioning revenues that were transferred to the merchant energy business effective july these decreases were partially offset by the increase in the standard offer service rate that bge charges its customers and other net impacts of the rate restructuring previously discussed 
fuel rate surcharge prior to july   we deferred included as an asset or liability in our consolidated balance sheets and excluded from our consolidated statements of income the difference between our actual costs of fuel and energy and what we collected from customers under the fuel rate in a given period 
effective july   the fuel rate clause was discontinued as a result of the deregulation of electric generation 
in september  the maryland psc approved the collection of the million accumulated difference between our actual costs of fuel and energy and the amounts collected from customers that were deferred under the electric fuel rate clause through june  we collected this accumulated difference from customers over the twelve month period ended october interchange and other sales interchange and other sales are sales in the pjm energy market and to others 
pjm is a ferc approved rto that also operates a regional power pool with members that include many wholesale market participants  as well as bge and other utility companies 
prior to the implementation of customer choice  bge sold energy to pjm members and to others after it had satisfied the demand for electricity in its own system 
effective july   bge no longer engages in interchange sales  as these activities are included in our merchant energy business  which resulted in a decrease in interchange and other sales for compared to electric fuel and purchased energy expenses in millions actual costs   recovery of costs deferred under electric fuel rate clause total electric fuel and purchased energy expenses   actual costs as discussed in the business environment electric competition section  effective july   bge transferred its generating assets to  and began purchasing substantially all of the energy and capacity required to provide electricity to standard offer service customers from  the merchant energy business 
our actual costs of fuel and purchased energy decreased in compared to mostly because bge purchased less energy due to large commercial and industrial customers leaving bge s fixed price standard offer service and electing other electric generation suppliers 
our actual costs of fuel and purchased energy increased in compared to mostly because of the deregulation of electric generation 
the higher amount bge paid for purchased energy from our merchant energy business is offset by the absence of million in in fuel costs  and lower operations and maintenance  depreciation  taxes  and other costs at bge as a result of no longer owning and operating the transferred electric generation plants 
prior to july   bge s purchased fuel and energy costs only included actual costs of fuel to generate electricity nuclear fuel  coal  gas  or oil and electricity we bought from others 
electric operations and maintenance expenses regulated electric operations and maintenance expenses decreased million in compared to mostly due to cost reductions resulting from our corporate wide workforce reduction programs and other productivity initiatives 
regulated electric operations and maintenance expenses decreased million during compared to mostly because effective july   costs of million were no longer incurred by this business segment 
these costs were associated with the electric generation assets that were transferred to the merchant energy business 
workforce reduction costs bge s electric business recognized expenses associated with our workforce reduction efforts as previously discussed in the significant events section and in note as a result of our workforce reduction programs and other process improvement initiatives  our electric business expects to realize cost savings of approximately million partially offset by other increases in operating costs in electric depreciation and amortization expense regulated electric depreciation and amortization expense was about the same during compared to regulated electric depreciation and amortization expense decreased million during compared to mostly due to the absence of million of amortization expense recorded in associated with the million reduction of our generating plants as a result of the deregulation of electric generation  and million of expenses associated with the transfer of the generation assets to the merchant energy business effective july electric taxes other than income taxes regulated electric taxes other than income taxes were about the same during compared to regulated electric taxes other than income taxes decreased million during compared to mostly due to the absence of taxes other than income taxes associated with the generation assets that were transferred to the merchant energy business effective july  partially offset by fewer tax credits 
regulated gas business all bge customers have the option to purchase gas from other suppliers 
to date  customer choice has not had a material effect on our  or bge s  financial results 
net income in millions revenues gas purchased for resale expenses operations and maintenance expenses workforce reduction costs depreciation and amortization taxes other than income taxes income from operations net income net income before special items included in operations workforce reduction costs net income above amounts include intercompany transactions eliminated in our consolidated financial statements 
note provides a reconciliation of operating results by segment to our consolidated financial statements 
net income from our regulated gas business decreased during compared to mostly due to a million pre tax disallowed portion of a previously established regulatory asset as discussed in the gas cost adjustments section and a million pre tax decrease in the shareholders portion of the sharing mechanism under our gas cost adjustment clauses 
net income from our regulated gas business increased during compared to mostly due to a million pre tax increase in the shareholders portion of the sharing mechanism under our gas cost adjustment clauses and an increase in our base rates 
gas revenues the changes in gas revenues in and compared to the respective prior year were caused by in millions distribution sales volumes base rates weather normalization gas cost adjustments total change in gas revenues from gas system sales off system sales other total change in gas revenues distribution sales volumes the percentage changes in our distribution sales volumes  by type of customer  in and compared to the respective prior year were residential commercial industrial we distributed more gas to residential and commercial customers during compared to mostly due to increased usage per customer  slightly colder weather  and an increased number of customers 
we distributed less gas to industrial customers mostly because of a decreased number of customers 
we distributed less gas to residential customers during compared to mostly due to milder winter weather and lower usage per customer partially offset by an increased number of customers 
we distributed more gas to commercial customers mostly due to higher usage per customer 
we distributed less gas to industrial customers mostly because of lower usage due to customers switching to lower cost alternative fuel sources and lower business needs related to the general downturn in the economy  partially offset by an increased number of customers 
base rates base rate revenues decreased during compared to mostly because of a decrease in the rate approved by the maryland psc associated with the energy conservation surcharge program 
base rate revenues increased during compared to mostly because the maryland psc authorized a million annual increase in our base rates effective june  weather normalization the maryland psc allows us to record a monthly adjustment to our gas revenues to eliminate the effect of abnormal weather patterns on our gas system sales volumes 
this means our monthly gas revenues are based on weather that is considered normal for the month and  therefore  are not affected by actual weather conditions 
gas cost adjustments we charge our gas customers for the natural gas they purchase from us using gas cost adjustment clauses set by the maryland psc as described in note however  under market based rates  our actual cost of gas is compared to a market index a measure of the market price of gas in a given period 
the difference between our actual cost and the market index is shared equally between shareholders and customers 
the shareholders portion decreased million during compared to the shareholders portion increased million during compared to effective november  the maryland psc approved an order that modifies certain provisions of the market based rates incentive mechanism 
these provisions require that bge secure fixed price contracts for at least  but not more than  of forecasted system supply requirements for the november through march period 
these fixed price contracts are not subject to sharing under the market based rates incentive mechanism 
we do not expect these changes to have a material impact on our financial results 
delivery service customers are not subject to the gas cost adjustment clauses because we are not selling gas to them 
we charge these customers fees to recover the fixed costs for the transportation service we provide 
these fees are the same as the base rate charged for gas distributed and are included in gas distribution volumes 
gas cost adjustment revenues decreased during compared to mostly because the gas we sold to non delivery service customers was at a lower price  partially offset by more gas sold 
gas cost adjustment revenues increased during compared to mostly because the gas we sold to non delivery service customers was at a higher price  partially offset by less gas sold 
in the first half of  the revenue increase reflects the significant increase in natural gas prices 
in december  a hearing examiner from the maryland psc issued a proposed order related to our annual gas adjustment clause review proceeding that will allow us to recover million of a previously established regulatory asset of million for certain credits that were over refunded to customers through our market based rates 
bge reserved the remaining difference of million as disallowed fuel costs 
however  we appealed the proposed order 
as of the date of this report  the maryland psc has not acted on bge s appeal 
off system sales off system gas sales are low margin direct sales of gas to wholesale suppliers of natural gas outside our service territory 
off system gas sales  which occur after we have satisfied our customers demand  are not subject to gas cost adjustments 
the maryland psc approved an arrangement for part of the margin from off system sales to benefit customers through reduced costs and the remainder to be retained by bge which benefits shareholders 
revenues from off system gas sales decreased during compared to mostly because we sold less gas at a lower price 
revenues from off system gas sales increased during compared to mostly because the gas we sold off system was at a higher price partially offset by less gas sold 
in the first half of  the revenue increase reflects the significant increase in natural gas prices 
gas purchased for resale expenses gas purchased for resale expenses include the cost of gas purchased for resale to our customers and for off system sales 
these costs do not include the cost of gas purchased by delivery service customers 
gas costs decreased during as compared to because we purchased gas at a lower price partially offset by the million of disallowed fuel costs as previously discussed in the gas cost adjustments section 
gas costs increased during compared to mostly because gas we purchased was at a higher price partially offset by less gas purchased for both system and off system sales 
gas operations and maintenance expenses regulated gas operations and maintenance expenses were about the same during and compared to the respective prior year 
in  cost reductions resulting from our corporate wide workforce reduction programs and other productivity initiatives were offset by the amortization of gas regulatory assets established in related to these initiatives 
workforce reduction costs bge s gas business recognized expenses associated with our workforce reduction efforts as previously discussed in the significant events section and in note as a result of our workforce reduction programs and other process improvement initiatives  our gas business expects to realize cost savings of approximately million partially offset by other increases in operating costs in other nonregulated businesses net income in millions revenues operating expenses workforce reduction costs impairment losses and other costs depreciation and amortization taxes other than income taxes net gain on sales of investments and other assets income loss from operations net income loss before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net income loss net loss before special items included in operations net gain on sales of investments and other assets workforce reduction costs costs associated with exit of bge home merchandise stores impairment of real estate  senior living  and international investments reduction of financial investment net income loss before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net income loss above amounts include intercompany transactions eliminated in our consolidated financial statements 
note provides a reconciliation of operating results by segment to our consolidated financial statements 
net income from our other nonregulated businesses increased during compared to mostly because of the following we recognized a million pre tax gain on the sale of our investment in orion in we recorded impairment losses and other costs in that had a negative impact in that year 
we recognized a loss on the sale of our guatemalan operations in that had a negative impact in that year 
we had higher earnings due to the growth of our energy services business and improved results from our international portfolio 
these increases were partially offset by the following we recognized gains on the sale of securities in that had a positive impact in that year  including the million pre tax gain on the sale of one million shares of our orion investment and million pre tax gains on the sale of securities by our financial investments operation 
we recorded million of pre tax costs associated with the exit of bge home merchandise stores in we recorded impairment losses of million pre tax related to certain non core assets in net income from our other nonregulated businesses decreased during compared to mostly because of the following items our latin american operation recorded a loss of million pre tax on the sale of our guatemalan operations 
we recorded impairment losses of million pre tax related to certain non core assets 
our financial investments operation recorded a million pre tax reduction of its investment in an aircraft due to the decline in value of used airplanes as a result of the september  terrorist attacks and the general downturn in the aviation industry 
our financial investments operation had lower earnings due to lower gains on the sale of securities and declining equity values in compared to we discuss our special items further in the significant events section and in note in addition  we recognized an million after tax  or 
per share  gain for the cumulative effect of adopting sfas no 
in the first quarter of as previously discussed in the significant events section  we decided to sell certain non core assets and accelerate the exit strategies on other assets that we will continue to hold and own over the next several years 
these assets included approximately  acres of land holdings in various stages of development located in seven sites in the central maryland region  an operating waste water treatment plant located in anne arundel county  maryland  all of our senior living facilities and certain international power projects 
in  we sold approximately acres of land holdings  all of our senior living facilities  and a south american generating facility 
while our intent is to dispose of these remaining non core assets  market conditions and other events beyond our control may affect the actual sale of these assets 
in addition  a future decline in the fair value of these assets could result in additional losses 
our remaining projects are partially or substantially developed 
our strategy is to hold and in some cases further develop these projects to increase their value 
however  if we were to sell these projects in the current market  we may have losses that could be material  although the amount of the losses is hard to predict 
in addition  we initiated a liquidation program for our financial investments operation and expect to sell substantially all of our investments in this operation by the end of through february   we liquidated approximately of our investment portfolio since the beginning of consolidated nonoperating income and expenses other income other income increased million during compared to mostly because of interest income on the nuclear decommissioning trust fund transferred in connection with the acquisition of nine mile point and income on temporary cash investments 
other income was about the same in compared to other income for bge increased million during compared to mostly because of interest income on temporary cash investments in the constellation energy cash pool 
other income for bge decreased million during compared to mostly due to the absence of income on the calvert cliffs decommissioning trust fund that was transferred to our merchant energy business effective july  as a result of electric deregulation 
fixed charges total fixed charges increased million during compared to mostly because of a higher level of debt outstanding at higher interest rates and lower capitalized interest due to our new generating facilities commencing operations 
in  we issued billion of long term debt and used the proceeds to repay short term borrowings  to prepay the nine mile point sellers note  and to fund acquisitions 
total fixed charges decreased million during compared to mostly because of lower interest rates and higher capitalized interest associated with our construction of new generating facilities 
these decreases were offset partially by a higher average level of debt outstanding 
total fixed charges for bge decreased million during as compared to mostly because of a lower level of debt outstanding due to the repayment of maturing long term debt 
total fixed charges for bge decreased million during compared to mostly because of a lower level of debt outstanding primarily due to the transfer of debt to our merchant energy business effective july  due to the implementation of electric deregulation 
income taxes the differences in income taxes result from a combination of the changes in income and the effective tax rate 
we include an analysis of the changes in the effective tax rate in note financial condition cash flows cash provided by operations was  million in compared to million in and million in cash used in investing activities was million in compared to  million in and  million in the decrease in compared to was mostly due to the sale of orion and copt that generated million in cash proceeds  as well as the liquidation program associated with our investment portfolio and a decrease in capital spending due to the termination of all planned development projects 
this was partially offset by the acquisitions of newenergy net of cash acquired for million in september and of alliance net of cash acquired for million in december the increase in compared to was mostly due to increased purchases of property  plant and equipment and other capital expenditures including million relating to the net cash paid for the acquisition of nine mile point 
cash used in financing activities was million in compared to cash provided by financing activities of million in and million in the decrease in compared to was mostly due to higher repayment of debt in and the issuance of common stock in this was partially offset by higher issuance of debt during the increase in compared to was mostly due to increased proceeds from the issuance of common stock  an increase in proceeds from the net issuance of short term borrowings  and a million decrease in common stock dividends paid 
these items were partially offset by the issuance of less long term debt and higher repayments of our long term debt 
security ratings independent credit rating agencies rate constellation energy s and bge s fixed income securities 
the ratings indicate the agencies assessment of each company s ability to pay interest  distributions  dividends  and principal on these securities 
these ratings affect how much it will cost each company to sell these securities 
the better the rating  the lower the cost of the securities to each company when they sell them 
the factors that credit rating agencies consider in establishing constellation energy s and bge s credit ratings include  but are not limited to  cash flows  liquidity  and the amount of debt as a component of total capitalization 
all constellation energy and bge credit ratings have stable outlooks 
at the date of this report  our credit ratings were as follows standard poors rating group moody s investors service fitch ratings constellation energy commercial paper a p f senior unsecured debt bbb baa a bge commercial paper a p f mortgage bonds a a a senior unsecured debt bbb a a trust originated preferred securities and preference stock bbb baa a available sources of funding in  we decided to sell certain non core assets to focus on our core strategies 
during  we realized proceeds of over million from the sale of non core assets and used these funds to repay both short term and long term debt 
in addition  during  we issued billion of debt and established billion of credit facilities resulting in billion of total credit facilities 
we continuously monitor our liquidity requirements and believe that our facilities and access to the capital markets provide sufficient liquidity to meet our business requirements 
we discuss our available sources of funding in more detail below 
constellation energy in addition to the billion of debt issued in  constellation energy has a commercial paper program under which we can issue short term notes to fund our subsidiaries 
at december   we had approximately billion of credit under three facilities as discussed below 
in june  constellation energy arranged a million day revolving credit facility and a million three year revolving credit facility 
we use these two facilities to allow issuance of commercial paper and letters of credit along with our previously established million revolving credit facility that expires in june at december   we had million of outstanding letters of credit that results in approximately billion of unused credit facilities 
these three facilities can issue letters of credit up to approximately billion 
constellation energy also has access to interim lines of credit as required from time to time to support its outstanding commercial paper 
bge bge maintains million in annual committed credit facilities  expiring may through november  in order to allow commercial paper to be issued 
as of december   bge had no outstanding commercial paper  which results in million in unused credit facilities 
bge also has access to interim lines of credit as required from time to time to support its outstanding commercial paper 
other nonregulated businesses bge home products services maintains a program to sell up to million of receivables 
if we can get a reasonable value for our remaining real estate projects and other investments  additional cash may be obtained by selling them 
our ability to sell or liquidate assets will depend on market conditions  and we cannot give assurances that these sales or liquidations could be made 
capital resources our business requires a great deal of capital 
our actual consolidated capital requirements for the years through  along with the estimated annual amount for  are shown in the table below 
we will continue to have cash requirements for working capital needs  payments of interest  distributions  and dividends  capital expenditures  and the retirement of debt and redemption of preference stock 
capital requirements for and include estimates of spending for existing and anticipated projects 
we continuously review and modify those estimates 
actual requirements may vary from the estimates included in the table below because of a number of factors including regulation  legislation  and competition  bge load requirements  environmental protection standards  the type and number of projects selected for construction or acquisition  the effect of market conditions on those projects  the cost and availability of capital  and the availability of cash from operations 
our estimates are also subject to additional factors

as of the date of this report  we have not completed our capital budgeting process  but expect our capital requirements to be approximately million 
capital requirements merchant energy business our merchant energy business will invest in the following costs for replacing the steam generators at calvert cliffs 
in march  we received a license extension from the nrc that extends calvert cliffs operating licenses to for unit and for unit replacement of the steam generators will allow us to operate these units through our operating license periods 
the steam generator replacement for unit was completed at the end of june we expect the steam generator replacement to occur during the refueling outage for unit continuing requirements  including construction expenditures for improvements to generating plants  nuclear fuel costs  costs of complying with the environmental protection agency epa  maryland  and pennsylvania nitrogen oxides nox emissions regulations  and enhancements to our information technology infrastructure 
we discuss the nox regulations and timing of expenditures in note the table on the previous page does not include the financing for the high desert megawatt gas fired generation project in california  which is under an operating lease with a term through february under the terms of the lease  we are required to make payments that represent all or a portion of the lease balance if construction is terminated prior to completion or we default under the lease 
under certain circumstances  we may be required to either post cash collateral equal to the outstanding lease balance or we may elect to purchase the property for the outstanding lease balance 
at any time during the term of the lease we have the right to pay off the lease and acquire the asset from the lessor 
at december   the outstanding lease balance plus other committed expenses was approximately million 
our wholly owned subsidiary  high desert power project llc  is supervising the construction of  and leasing  the high desert project from high desert power trust  an independent special purpose entity spe created to own and lease the project to our subsidiary 
neither constellation energy nor any affiliate owns any equity or other interest in high desert power trust  which is owned by a consortium of banks and other financial institutions 
we provide a guaranty of high desert power project llc s obligations to the trust 
the high desert power project uses an off balance sheet financing structure through this spe and currently qualifies as an operating lease 
as an operating lease  we do not record any assets or debt associated with the project in our consolidated balance sheets 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  that will impact the accounting for  but not the cash flows associated with  our high desert operating lease and the related spe 
under the interpretation and current lease structure  we will be required to consolidate the spe in our consolidated balance sheets as of july   which is the effective date of fin had we consolidated this project at december   we would have recorded approximately million of development  construction  and capitalized financing costs as an asset and the related financial obligations as a liability in our consolidated balance sheets 
we discuss fin in more detail in note the lease with the trust contains several events of default that are commonly found in financings of this type  including failure to make all payments when due  failure to comply with all covenants  violation of material representations and warranties and change of control 
in addition  several events of default are applicable to us as guarantor  including defaults in other material financing agreements and failure to own of bge s common stock 
at the conclusion of the lease term in  we have the following options renew the lease upon approval of the lessors  elect to purchase the property for a price equal to the lease balance at the end of the term  or request the lessor to sell the property 
if the lessor sells the property  we guarantee the payment of any difference between the sale proceeds and the lease balance at the time of sale up to a maximum amount of approximately of such lease balance 
the lease balance at the end of the term is currently estimated to be million  which represents the estimated cost of the project  however  this may vary based on the ultimate cost of construction and interest incurred during the construction period 
regulated electric and gas regulated electric and gas construction expenditures primarily include new business construction needs and improvements to existing facilities 
funding for capital requirements merchant energy business funding for the expansion of our merchant energy business is expected from internally generated funds 
we also have available sources from commercial paper issuances  issuances of long term debt and equity  leases  and other financing activities 
the projects that our merchant energy business develops typically require substantial capital investment 
most of the projects recently constructed were funded through corporate borrowings by constellation energy 
many of the qualifying facilities and independent power projects that we have an interest are financed primarily with non recourse debt that is repaid from the project s cash flows 
this debt is collateralized by interests in the physical assets  major project contracts and agreements  cash accounts and  in some cases  the ownership interest in that project 
we expect to fund acquisitions with a mixture of debt and equity with an overall goal of maintaining a strong investment grade credit profile 
bge funding for utility capital expenditures is expected from internally generated funds 
during  we expect our regulated utility business to generate significant excess cash flows from operations 
if necessary  additional funding may be obtained from commercial paper issuances  available capacity under credit facilities  the issuance of long term debt  trust securities  or preference stock  and or from time to time equity contributions from constellation energy 
during  constellation energy made a million capital contribution to bge 
bge also participates in a cash pool administered by constellation energy as discussed in note other nonregulated businesses funding for our other nonregulated businesses is expected from internally generated funds  commercial paper issuances  issuances of long term debt of constellation energy  sales of securities and assets  and or from time to time equity contributions from constellation energy 
bge home products services can continue to fund capital requirements through sales of receivables 
our ability to sell or liquidate securities and non core assets will depend on market conditions  and we cannot give assurances that these sales or liquidations could be made

amounts related to capital expenditures are included for applicable years in our capital requirements table 
while the face amount of these guarantees is  million  we do not expect to fund the full amount as our calculation of the fair value of obligations covered by these guarantees was million at december  other guarantees in the above table are shown net of liabilities recorded at december  in our consolidated balance sheets 
the amount shown in the table primarily relates to the high desert lease 
while we included our contingent obligations in the table above  these amounts do not represent incremental consolidated constellation energy obligations  rather  they primarily represent guarantees from one constellation entity to another 
we do not expect to fund the full amounts under the letters of credit and guarantees 
specifically  the  million guarantees competitive supply represent the face amount of these guarantees 
however  we do not expect to fund the full amount  as our calculation of the fair value of obligations covered by these guarantees was million at december  lease payments under the high desert operating lease are reflected in other guarantees  net in the table on the previous page 
the lease balance at the end of the lease term is currently estimated to be million 
the table on the previous page does not include the fixed payment portions of our mark to market energy assets and liabilities primarily related to capacity payments under tolling contracts 
we discuss the expected settlement terms of these contracts in the competitive supply mark to market energy assets and liabilities section 
liquidity provisions we have certain agreements that contain provisions that would require additional collateral upon significant credit rating decreases in the senior unsecured debt of constellation energy 
decreases in constellation energy s credit ratings would not trigger an early payment on any of our credit facilities 
however  under counterparty contracts related to our origination and risk management operation  where we are obligated to post collateral  we estimate that we would have additional collateral obligations based on downgrades to the following credit ratings for our senior unsecured debt credit ratings downgraded level below current rating incremental obligations cumulative obligations in millions bbb baa bbb baa below investment grade at december   we had approximately billion of unused credit facilities and million of cash available to meet potential requirements 
however  based on market conditions and contractual obligations at the time of such a downgrade  we could be required to post collateral in an amount that could exceed the amounts specified above  and which could be material 
in many cases  customers of our origination and risk management operation rely on the creditworthiness of constellation energy 
a decline below investment grade by constellation energy would negatively impact the business prospects of that operation 
the credit facilities of constellation energy and bge have limited material adverse change clauses that only consider a material change in financial condition and are not directly affected by decreases in credit ratings 
if these clauses are violated  the lending institutions can decline making new advances or issuing new letters of credit  but cannot accelerate existing amounts outstanding 
the long term debt indentures of constellation energy and bge do not contain material adverse change clauses or financial covenants 
certain credit facilities of constellation energy contain a provision requiring constellation energy to maintain a ratio of debt to capitalization equal to or less than 
at december   the debt to capitalization ratios as defined in the credit agreements were no greater than 
a bge credit facility of million that expires in august requires bge to maintain a ratio of debt to capitalization equal to or less than 
at december   the debt to capitalization ratio for bge as defined in the credit agreement was 
at december   no amount is outstanding under this facility 
failure by constellation energy  or bge  to comply with these covenants could result in the maturity of the debt outstanding under these facilities being accelerated 
the credit facilities of constellation energy contain usual and customary cross default provisions that apply to defaults on debt by constellation energy and certain subsidiaries over a specified threshold 
certain bge credit facilities also contain usual and customary cross default provisions that apply to defaults on debt by bge over a specified threshold 
the indentures pursuant to which bge has issued and outstanding mortgage bonds and subordinated debentures provide that a default under any debt instrument issued under the relevant indenture may cause a default of all debt outstanding under such indenture 
constellation energy also provides credit support to calvert cliffs and nine mile point to ensure these plants have funds to meet expenses and obligations to safely operate and maintain the plants 
we discuss our short term borrowings in note  long term debt in note  lease requirements in note  and commitments and guarantees in note market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in interest rates  certain commodity prices  credit risk  and equity prices 
to manage our market risk  we may enter into various derivative instruments including swaps  forward contracts  futures contracts  and options 
in this section  we discuss our current market risk and the related use of derivative instruments 
interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of financing through our issuance of variable rate and fixed rate debt 
we may use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate risks 
the following table provides information about our debt obligations that are sensitive to interest rate changes principal payments and interest rate detail by contractual maturity date thereafter total fair value at dec 
 dollar amounts in millions short term debt variable rate debt average interest rate long term debt variable rate debt average interest rate fixed rate debt a average interest rate a amount excludes million of long term debt that contains certain put options under which lenders could potentially require us to repay the debt prior to maturity and is classified as current portion of long term debt in our consolidated balance sheets 
commodity risk we are exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the price and transportation costs of electricity  natural gas  coal  and other commodities 
these risks arise from our ownership and operation of power plants  the load serving activities of bge standard offer service and our competitive supply activities  and our mark to market origination and risk management activities 
we discuss these risks separately for our merchant energy and our regulated businesses below 
merchant energy business our merchant energy business is exposed to various risks in the competitive marketplace that may materially impact its financial results and affect our earnings 
these risks include changes in commodity prices  imbalances in supply and demand  and operational risk 
commodity prices commodity price risk arises from the potential for changes in the price of  and transportation costs for  electricity  natural gas  coal  and other commodities  the volatility of commodity prices  and changes in interest rates 
a number of factors associated with the structure and operation of the electricity markets significantly influence the level and volatility of prices for energy commodities and related derivative products 
we use such commodities and contracts in our merchant energy business  and if we have not hedged the associated financial exposure  this price volatility could affect our earnings 
these factors include seasonal daily and hourly changes in demand  extreme peak demands due to weather conditions  available supply resources  transportation availability and reliability within and between regions  procedures used to maintain the integrity of the physical electricity system during extreme conditions  and changes in the nature and extent of federal and state regulations 
these factors can affect energy commodity and derivative prices in different ways and to different degrees 
these effects may vary throughout the country as a result of regional differences in weather conditions  market liquidity  capability and reliability of the physical electricity and gas systems  and the nature and extent of electricity deregulation 
supply and demand risk we are exposed to the risk that available sources of supply may differ from the amount of power demanded by our customers under fixed price load serving contracts 
during periods of high demand  our power supplies may be insufficient to serve our customers needs and could require us either to generate power using plants with more costly fuel or to purchase additional energy at higher prices 
alternatively  during periods of low demand  our power supplies may exceed our customers needs and could result in us selling that excess energy at lower prices 
either of those circumstances could have a negative impact on our earnings 
operational risk operational risk is the risk that a generating plant will not be available to produce energy and the risks related to physical delivery of energy to meet our customers needs 
for  we expect to use the majority of the generating capacity controlled by our merchant energy business to provide standard offer service to bge or to serve the load requirements of the sellers of nine mile point 
beginning in july  approximately  megawatts of industrial customer load moved from bge s standard offer service to market based rates 
going forward  our merchant energy business will supply of the standard offer service to bge through june  and from july  through june  as a result of declines in bge s standard offer service load and the  megawatts of natural gas fired peaking and combined cycle generating facilities recently constructed  we have a substantial amount of generating capacity that is subject to future changes in wholesale electricity prices and have fuel requirements that are subject to future changes in coal  natural gas  and oil prices 
our power generation facilities purchase fuel under contracts or on the spot market 
fuel prices may be volatile and the price that can be obtained from power sales may not change at the same rate as changes in fuel costs 
additionally  if one or more of our generating facilities is not able to produce electricity when required due to operational factors  we may have to forego sales opportunities or fulfill fixed price sale commitments through the operation of other more costly generating facilities or through the purchase of energy in the wholesale market at higher prices 
our nuclear plants produce electricity at a relatively low marginal cost 
as a result  the costs of replacement energy associated with outages at these plants can be significant 
if an unplanned outage were to occur during the summer or winter when demand was at a high level  the replacement power costs could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
calvert cliffs experienced an extended outage to replace the steam generators for unit during a refueling outage in the spring of  and will experience another extended outage to replace the steam generators for unit during a refueling outage in the spring risk management as part of our overall portfolio  we manage the commodity price risk of our competitive supply activities and our electric generation facilities  including power sales  fuel and energy purchases  emission credits  weather risk  and the market risk of outages 
in order to manage these risks  we may enter into fixed price derivative or non derivative contracts to hedge the variability in future cash flows from forecasted sales of electricity and purchases of fuel and energy  including forward contracts  which commit us to purchase or sell energy commodities in the future  futures contracts  which are exchange traded standardized commitments to purchase or sell a commodity or financial instrument  or to make a cash settlement  at a specific price and future date  swap agreements  which require payments to or from counterparties based upon the differential between two prices for a predetermined contractual notional quantity  and option contracts  which convey the right to buy or sell a commodity  financial instrument  or index at a predetermined price 
the objectives for entering into such hedges include fixing the price for a portion of anticipated future electricity sales at a level that provides an acceptable return on our electric generation operations  fixing the price of a portion of anticipated fuel purchases for the operation of our power plants  and fixing the price for a portion of anticipated energy purchases to supply our load serving customers 
the portion of forecasted transactions hedged may vary based upon management s assessment of market  weather  operational  and other factors 
while some of the contracts we use to manage risk represent commodities or instruments for which prices are available from external sources  other commodities and certain contracts are not actively traded and are valued using other pricing sources and modeling techniques to determine expected future market prices  contract quantities  or both 
we use our best estimates to determine the fair value of commodity and derivative contracts we hold and sell 
these estimates consider various factors including closing exchange and over the counter price quotations  time value  volatility factors  and credit exposure 
however  it is likely that future market prices could vary from those used in recording mark to market energy assets and liabilities  and such variations could be material 
we monitor and manage our risk exposures through separate  but complementary financial  operational  and credit reporting systems 
constellation energy s board of directors establishes parameters for the risks that we can undertake and risk levels are monitored daily by management and our chief risk officer 
in addition  we maintain segregation of duties  with credit review and risk monitoring functions performed by groups that are independent from revenue producing groups 
we measure the sensitivity of our mark to market energy contracts to potential changes in market prices using value at risk 
value at risk is a statistical model that attempts to predict risk of loss based on historical market price volatility 
we calculate value at risk using a variance covariance technique that models option positions using a linear approximation of their value 
additionally  we estimate variances and correlation using historical commodity price changes over the most recent rolling three month period 
our value at risk calculation includes all mark to market energy assets and liabilities  including contracts for energy commodities and derivatives that result in physical settlement and contracts that require cash settlement 
the value at risk calculation does not include market risks associated with activities that are subject to accrual accounting  primarily our generating facilities and our competitive supply load serving activities 
we manage these risks by monitoring our fuel and energy purchase requirements and our estimated contract sales volumes compared to associated supply arrangements 
we also engage in hedging activities to manage these risks 
we describe those risks and our hedging activities earlier in this section 
the value at risk amount represents the potential pre tax loss in the fair value of mark to market energy assets and liabilities over a one day holding period 
based on the confidence levels in the table below  we would expect a one day change in fair value greater than or equal to the daily value at risk at least once per year 
our value at risk was as follows confidence level confidence level year ended december  in millions year end average high low the high value at risk amount for the year represents certain hedge contracts entered into in anticipation of closing an offsetting transaction 
when the offsetting transaction closed within several days  the value at risk amount returned to a level more representative of the average for the year 
due to the inherent limitations of statistical measures such as value at risk  the relative immaturity of the competitive market for electricity and related derivatives  and the seasonality of changes in market prices  the value at risk calculation may not reflect the full extent of our commodity price risk exposure 
additionally  actual changes in the value of options may differ from the value at risk calculated using a linear approximation inherent in our calculation method 
as a result  actual changes in the fair value of mark to market energy assets and liabilities could differ from the calculated value at risk  and such changes could have a material impact on our financial results 
regulated electric business effective july   bge s residential rates are frozen for a six year period  and its commercial and industrial rates are frozen for four to six years 
bge entered into standard offer service arrangements with our origination and risk management operation and allegheny energy supply company to provide the energy and capacity required to meet its standard offer service obligations through june  regulated gas business our regulated gas business may enter into gas futures  options  and swaps to hedge its price risk under our market based rate incentive mechanism and our off system gas sales program 
we discuss this further in note at december  and  our exposure to commodity price risk for our regulated gas business was not material 
credit risk we are exposed to credit risk  primarily through our merchant energy business 
credit risk is the loss that may result from a counterparty s nonperformance 
we use credit policies to manage our credit risk  including utilizing an established credit approval process  monitoring counterparty limits  employing credit mitigation measures such as margin  collateral  or prepayment arrangements  and using master netting agreements 
we measure credit risk as the replacement cost for open energy commodity and derivative positions both mark to market and accrual plus amounts owed from counterparties for settled transactions 
the replacement cost of open positions represents unrealized gains  net of any unrealized losses  where we have a legally enforceable right of setoff 
recently  several major participants in the energy markets suffered severe declines in their credit ratings or declared bankruptcy 
however  as of december   approximately of our credit portfolio was rated at least investment grade by the major rating agencies  with rated below investment grade and not rated 
of the portion not rated  primarily represents governmental entities  municipalities  cooperatives  power pools  or other load serving entities that we assess are equivalent to investment grade based on internal credit ratings 
due to the possibility of extreme volatility in the prices of energy commodities and derivatives  the market value of contractual positions with individual counterparties could exceed established credit limits or collateral provided by those counterparties 
if such a counterparty were then to fail to perform its obligations under its contract for example  fail to deliver the electricity our origination and risk management operation had contracted for  we could sustain a loss that could have a material impact on our financial results 
additionally  if a counterparty were to default and we were to liquidate all contracts with that entity  our credit loss would include the loss in value of mark to market contracts  the amount owed for settled transactions  and additional payments  if any  we would have to make to settle unrealized losses on accrual contracts 
equity price risk we are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets primarily through our financial investments operation  our pension plan assets  and our nuclear decommissioning trust funds 
we are required by the nrc to maintain an externally funded trust for the costs of decommissioning our nuclear power plants 
we discuss our nuclear decommissioning trust funds in more detail in note a hypothetical decrease in equity prices would result in an approximate million reduction in the fair value of our financial investments that are classified as trading or available for sale securities 
in  the value of our defined benefit pension plan assets decreased by approximately million due to declines in the markets in which plan assets are invested 
we describe our financial investments in more detail in note  and our pension plans in note item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the information required by this item with respect to market risk is set forth in item of part ii of this form k under the heading market risk
