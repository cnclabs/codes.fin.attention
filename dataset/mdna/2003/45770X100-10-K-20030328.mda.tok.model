critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  sales returns  bad debts  intangible assets  and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these 
table of contents estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue recognition rules for software companies are complex 
we follow specific and detailed guidelines in measuring revenue  however  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue policy 
revenue results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could result in future operating losses 
we record revenue in accordance with statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by sop no 
 software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  and related interpretations including technical practice aids 
license revenue consists principally of revenue earned under fixed term and perpetual software license agreements and is generally recognized upon shipment of the software after execution of a non cancelable signed license agreement or receipt of a definitive purchase order as appropriate  if collection of the resulting receivable is probable  the fee is fixed or determinable  undelivered elements are not deemed essential  and vendor specific objective evidence exists for all undelivered elements 
revenues under such arrangements  which may include several different software products and services sold together  are allocated based on the residual method in accordance with sop no 
under the residual method  the fair value of the non essential undelivered elements is deferred and subsequently recognized when earned 
we have established vendor specific objective evidence for professional services  training and support services 
in addition  we have established vendor specific objective evidence for maintenance related to most of our products 
vendor specific objective evidence is based on the price charged when an element is sold separately or  in case of an element not yet sold separately  the price established by authorized management  if it is probable that the price  once established  will not change before market introduction 
in the event that vendor specific objective evidence may not be established for maintenance  and maintenance is the only remaining element of an arrangement  then all revenue associated with the arrangement is recognized ratably starting the month after installation or acceptance  whichever occurs later  to the end of the maintenance period 
standard terms for license agreements typically call for payment within days 
probability of collection is based upon the assessment of the customer s financial condition through the review of their current financial statements or credit reports 
for existing customers  prior payment history is also used to evaluate probability of collection 
we provide for estimated returns at the time of sale 
we require our customers to purchase one year maintenance contracts on most of our products 
maintenance fees  which include unspecified product upgrades on a when and if available basis  are based on a percentage of the current list price of the licensed software products as determined by the price the customer would pay for maintenance renewal 
maintenance renewals are optional 
in accordance with sop  maintenance revenues are recognized ratably over the service period 
we offer optional consulting and training services 
consulting revenues include deployment assistance  project management  integration with existing customer applications and related services performed on a time and materials basis under separate service arrangements 
revenues from consulting and training services are recognized as services are performed 
standard terms for renewal of customer support contracts  consulting services and training call for payment within days 
fees from licenses sold together with consulting are generally recognized upon shipment of the software  provided that the above criteria are met  payment of the license fees is not dependent upon the performance of the services  and the consulting services are not essential to the functionality of the licensed software 
if the services are essential to the functionality of the software  or payment of the license fees is dependent upon the performance of the services  both the software license and consulting fees are recognized under the percentage of completion method of contract accounting 
all sales made through indirect channels including value added resellers  or vars  and distributors are accounted for using the sell through method 

table of contents if the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer 
if an acceptance period is required  revenues are recognized upon the earlier of customer acceptance or the expiration of the acceptance period 
amounts received in advance for maintenance agreements are recorded as deferred revenue on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
revenue from professional services as well as funded research under government grants is generally recognized as the work is performed under time and materials contracts 
however  under fixed bid contracts  we use the percentage of completion method of accounting 
in so doing  we make important judgments in estimating revenue and cost and in measuring progress toward completion 
revenue and cost estimates are revised periodically based on changes in circumstances  and any losses on contracts are recognized immediately 
sales returns we provide an estimated returns and allowances reserve for return rights at the time of sale 
we offer our customers a day return policy on all of our products 
refunds are provided to customers upon return to us of the complete product package  including all original materials  cd rom or other media 
our provision for sales returns is estimated based on historical returns experience and our judgment of future return risk 
bad debts we are required to estimate the collectibility of our trade receivables 
a considerable amount of judgment is required when we assess the ultimate realization of receivables including assessing the aging of the amounts  the current credit worthiness of each customer  economic conditions and historic experience 
impairment of intangible assets our business acquisitions have resulted in  and future acquisitions typically will result in  the recording of goodwill  which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired as well as capitalized technology and other definite lived intangible assets 
these assets are periodically reviewed for potential impairment indicators 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions and operational performance of the acquired business 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill or other long lived assets are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and operating results 
in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we adopted sfas no 
on january  sfas no 
supercedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions relating to the disposal of a segment of a business in accounting principles board opinion no 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the carrying value of intangible assets  other than goodwill  and other long lived assets is reviewed on a regular basis for the existence of facts or circumstances  both internal and external that may suggest impairment 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired 
before december   goodwill resulting from acquisitions competed prior to june  was amortized on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life 
at december   of goodwill remained from acquisitions completed prior to june  with the required adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  beginning january  we no longer amortize goodwill to earnings 
instead  goodwill is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis or on an interim basis if circumstances change or if events occur that reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
we determine fair value using the market value 
table of contents method or the present value method of measurement of future cash flows 
the transitional impairment test as prescribed by sfas was completed with a january  measurement date and no impairment was indicated at that time 
in the fourth quarter of we performed our annual impairment analysis 
based on an analysis of discounted expected future cash flows  an impairment of the goodwill associated with our acquisition of predict ag was indicated and we recorded a loss from impairment of  in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangible assets  we made assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
our future cash flows are based on current volume and pricing levels with anticipated rates of growth and change 
if our estimated future cash flow or their related assumptions were to change  we would be required to record impairment charges for these assets for which the carrying value is not supported by the future cash flows 
separable intangible assets that do not have indefinite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
contingencies we are engaged in legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of possible losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies are made after careful analysis of each individual matter 
the required reserves  if any  may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach  such as a change in settlement strategy for a particular matter 
discontinued operations on june   we incorporated freescholarships 
com  inc fsc as a wholly owned subsidiary 
fsc began web based operations in february as an internet company providing information and assistance to a broad consumer market focused on funding the costs of education 
during  we discontinued the operations of fsc 
in connection with this discontinuation  we recorded a million loss from discontinued operations 
on january   we sold the operations of our engineering and education products division eepd for cash proceeds of  resulting in a gain of  including  recorded in and  recorded in the gain on disposal of discontinued operations recorded in resulted from the favorable resolution of certain contingencies relating to the transaction during the second and third quarters of we believe that all significant contingencies relating to the discontinued operations have now been resolved 
components of the net gain are included in the table below 
as of december   other accrued liabilities included approximately  related to a contingency resulting from the disposition 
the contingency was resolved during reducing other accrued liabilities from  to  and income taxes from  to  resulting in a gain of cash proceeds net assets transferred employee severance and termination benefits transaction costs other accrued liabilities taxes income from discontinued operations 
table of contents components of loss from discontinued operations are as follows years ended december  revenues costs and expenses income loss from discontinued operations acquisitions on september   we completed the acquisition of predict ag predict 
the transaction was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
this acquisition provides us with a european professional services headquarters consisting of a multi lingual team of business and technical experts in analytic crm  business intelligence  data mining  data warehousing  predictive modeling  and statistical analysis 
the aggregate consideration paid was  consisting of  cash  common stock valued at  and direct transaction costs of  the value of the  shares of common stock issued was determined based on the average market price of our common stock over a three day period before and after the date of acquisition 
we recorded intangible assets for the value allocated to non compete agreements and customer relationships totaling  which are being amortized on a straight line basis over a two year period  representing the expected life of the non compete agreements that we acquired 
we recorded  for the value allocated to deferred stock based compensation in connection with restrictions on  shares of common stock otherwise issuable as part of the acquisition  which is being amortized over a three year vesting period using a graded vesting approach 
the difference between the purchase price and the fair value of the assets acquired in the amount of  was recorded as goodwill 
during the continued decline in the market for it software and services prompted a re assessment of all key assumptions underlying our goodwill valuation judgments  including those related to short and longer term growth rates 
in the fourth quarter of  using an october  measurement date  we performed our annual impairment analysis as required under fas and determined that a loss from impairment of goodwill of  was required because the forecasted undiscounted cash flows were less than the book value of predict 
due to uncertain market conditions and potential changes in our strategy and product portfolio  it is possible that forecasts used to support our intangible assets may change in the future  which could result in additional non cash charges that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
on july   we completed the acquisition of a data analysis consulting business from waratah corporation

table of contents revenues total revenues consist of software license  software maintenance  and professional services revenues 
total revenues increased from  in to  in  an increase of  and decreased to  in  a decrease of from software license revenues  consisting of software licenses and subscriptions  accounted for of total revenues in and in software license revenues decreased from  in to  in  a decrease of  to  in  a decrease of 
the decrease is primarily due to lower desktop license sales in international regions 
the decrease was primarily due to the dampened demand in the second half of and in caused by the economic slowdown  which adversely affected corporate spending on information technology in many of the industries we serve 
software maintenance revenues accounted for of total revenues in and in software maintenance revenues increased from  in to  in  an increase of  to  in  an increase of 
these increases were due to an increase in our installed base and ongoing maintenance renewals 
professional services revenues generated from consulting and training activities increased from  in to  in  an increase of  to  in  a decrease of from in the revenue growth in professional services was primarily due to worldwide expansion of our consulting resources through the acquisition of two data analysis businesses in the united states north carolina and europe switzerland 
in the revenue decrease was primarily due to generally weak economic conditions  resulting in fewer available projects and a reduction in our consulting headcount  particularly in our swiss office 
revenues from international operations increased from  in to  in  an increase of  to  in  an increase of 
these increases resulted from our international expansion through acquisition  resulting in the formation of a french subsidiary in july  a swiss subsidiary in september and a german subsidiary in january the purpose of the company s aggressive expansion in europe was to enhance growth and reduce our exposure to the north american economy 
we expect our license and maintenance revenues to grow in  subject to the successful launch of new products and worldwide economic recovery  as we continue to increase our sales and marketing resources 
however  we continue to expect our professional services revenues to remain flat or decrease until demand for it services becomes more robust 
cost of revenues total cost of revenues increased from  in to  in  an increase of  and decreased to  in  a decrease of from the increase in total cost of revenues was primarily due to a product mix shift toward more cost intensive revenues such as consulting while the decrease was primarily due to a shift back towards lower cost software related products 
the cost of software related revenue  which consists of royalties for third party software  product media  product duplication  manuals and costs of maintenance  decreased as a percentage of total software related revenues from in  to in  to in the decrease was primarily due to an  increase in maintenance revenue  which carries a low cost of sales as compared to software license and consulting services revenues 
the decrease was primarily due to an  increase in maintenance revenues as well as to revenues from new products which carry lower royalty costs 
we are a worldwide licensee of the s programming language from lucent technologies inc under the license  we have the right to use  sublicense and support the s language in exchange for royalties  which are included in the cost of software licenses 
we expect that the cost of software will continue to fluctuate modestly in relation to both changes in demand for our software products and to the extent that our products incorporate the s programming language 

table of contents the cost of professional services includes primarily the salaries  and other operating costs of employees who provide consulting services and product training 
the cost of professional services as a percentage of professional services revenues increased from in  to in and to in these increases were primarily due to increased investment in professional services resources  including acquired businesses  to help the company scale and leverage additional product sales  as well as to lower services revenues 
we expect the cost of professional services to remain flat or decrease slightly and for our services margin to gradually improve as utilization of existing resources grows 
operating expenses sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  travel  facility costs for sales and marketing personnel  promotional activities  and costs of advertising and trade shows 
sales and marketing increased from  in to  in  an increase of from  to  in  an increase of 
as a percentage of total revenues  sales and marketing expenses increased from in to in and in these increases were primarily due to additions to the sales force to expand our sales opportunities  including the addition of our french  swiss and german subsidiaries 
we expect our sales and marketing expenses to increase as we add more sales and marketing headcount in research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits  equipment for software developers  facility costs  and payments to outside contractors 
funded research amounts represent funding received primarily from us federal government agencies for work performed by our research and development department under cost reimbursement arrangements 
net research and development expenses increased from  in to  in  a increase  to  in  a further increase 
net research and development increased as a percentage of total revenues from in to in  and to in in the increase in net research and development expenses was primarily due to increased investment in the s plus product lines  and offset partially by the increase in research funding 
in this increase was primarily due to increased investment in new product offerings such as insightful miner and infact and to a decrease in funded research 
funded research  which consists primarily of government grants for research projects  increased from  in to  in  an increase of  and decreased to  in  a decrease of 
the change in funded research is attributable to the amount of awarded contracts 
we expect our gross research and development expenses to decrease as compared to based on previous business restructuring and for funded research to continue to fluctuate based on contract awards 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs associated with finance  accounting  investor relations  human resources  administration and facilities activities 
general and administrative expenses increased from  in to  in  an increase of  to  in  a decrease of 
as a percentage of total revenues  general and administrative expenses increased from in to in and in the increase in general and administrative costs in was primarily due to costs associated with divesting the mathsoft engineering and educations products division and migrating the corporate headquarters from cambridge  massachusetts to seattle  washington  and professional fees associated with general corporate matters and corporate expansion 
we expect future increases in general and administrative expenses resulting from higher legal  accounting  and insurance costs associated with being a publicly listed company 
amortization of stock based compensation expense consists of amounts related to common stock issued in acquisitions  which are subject to cancellation related to employee termination 
amortization of deferred stock based compensation was  in and  in in  stock based compensation expense was included in the functional operating expense categories as follows  for sales and marketing   for cost of professional services revenues  and  for research and development

table of contents in  we recorded a loss from impairment of  resulting from a write down of the carrying value of goodwill for predict ag as computed under fas this was due to both the continued decline in the market for it software and services from the september date of acquisition of predict and to our july restructuring  which resulted in the termination of nearly of the headcount in our swiss office 
restructuring related charges in november and july we implemented workforce reductions in order to better align our costs with our revenues 
the restructuring totaled  and resulted in the reduction of approximately employees  or of our employee base at the time 
as of december   all severance and termination benefits related to this workforce reduction were paid 
the restructuring totaled  and resulted in a workforce reduction of employees  or of our employee base at the time 
all of the restructuring charges related to employee severance and termination benefits 
as of december    of the severance and termination benefits had been paid and  remained accrued on that date 
these remaining benefits will be paid by january interest income and expense interest and other income increased from  in to  in  but decreased to  in the increase in was due to an increase in cash and cash equivalents upon which we earn interest while the decrease in was due to a decrease in average balances of cash and cash equivalents and to a decrease in prevailing interest rates 
interest expense decreased from  in to  in  and increased to  in the higher expense in was due to borrowings of  under the equipment term loan  offset somewhat by lower prevailing interest rates 
income taxes as of december  the company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  and research and development and other tax credit carryforwards of approximately  utilization of net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to certain limitations under section of the internal revenue code 
deferred tax assets  which have arisen primarily as a result of these net operating losses and other tax credits also reflect the effect of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the corresponding financial statement amounts 
due to the uncertainty of the company s ability to utilize its deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance has been established for financial reporting purposes equal to the amount of the net deferred tax assets 
income tax expense of  in and  in primarily reflect the provision for foreign income taxes associated with our international operations 
the income tax benefit in of  primarily relates to a reversal of income taxes payable and a tax refund on completion of a tax audit at one of our international operations

mr 
alaiyan seeks an unspecified amount of damages 
we deny mr

an evaluation of the likelihood of an adverse outcome cannot be expressed with sufficient certainty at this time 
an unfavorable outcome could have a material effect on our operating position  results of operations  and cash flows

in march  we entered into a million working capital revolving line of credit and security agreement with silicon valley bank  or svb  that is secured by our accounts receivable

a total of  was available under this facility at december  in march  we also entered into an equipment term loan and security agreement with svb  which provides up to million to finance the purchase of equipment and fixtures 
this facility allows us to take advances on the cost of eligible equipment less than days old and is secured by the underlying equipment 
advances bear interest at the prime rate  which was as of december   plus 
these credit facilities contain covenants that require us to maintain a certain level of net income 
in july of  we renegotiated these covenants to exclude the restructuring charge we incurred as a result of the july reduction in our workforce 
in january of we renegotiated these covenants to exclude the impairment loss from goodwill that we incurred as a result of applying the provisions of fas to the carrying value of goodwill that we recorded as part of the acquisition of predict 
these credit facilities may be utilized to finance future capital investments  including technology necessary to support our new product lines 
these credit facilities expand our liquid resources and ability to maintain an adequate balance of cash on hand

table of contents as of december  we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  and research and development and other tax credit carryforwards of approximately  the net operating loss and credit carryforwards will expire at various dates through  if not used 
under the provisions of the internal revenue code  substantial changes in our ownership may limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that could be utilized annually in the future to offset taxable income 
a full valuation allowance has been established in our financial statements to reflect the uncertainty of our ability to use available tax loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents  investments and available bank borrowings will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  if during that time market conditions worsen  or if other unforeseen events should occur  we would likely deem it necessary to seek additional funds through public or private equity financing or from other sources in order to fund our operations and pursue our growth strategy 
we have no commitment for additional financing  and we may experience difficulty in obtaining funding on favorable terms  if at all 
any financing we obtain may contain covenants that restrict our freedom to operate our business or may require us to issue securities that have rights  preferences or privileges senior to our common stock and may dilute your ownership interest in insightful 
business outlook we provide our customers with useful and innovative software and services to derive intelligence from the data they collect 
today  organizations collect far more data  of varied forms  than they actually analyze and meaningfully apply 
the analysis of this data can lead to significant improvements in the quality and efficacy of products built  marketed  and sold 
furthermore  there are large amounts of additional information that organizations will collect in the future to drive higher return on investment 
overall  as recognized by industry analysts  this implies significant long term potential for data analysis companies such as insightful 
throughout our history  we have  to varying degrees  tailored our data analysis solutions to the needs of the following industries securities and banking  life sciences  manufacturing  telecommunications  environmental  and defense intelligence 
we also serve the academic community  though our objective there is not to drive short term increased revenues but rather seed for future commercial sales 
the present and future outlook for spending on software solutions in the industries we serve varies based on macro and micro economic factors 
competition for the reduced software budgets which organizations have available within these industries has been fierce 
in addition  we re seeing more of our customers explore and adopt open source data analysis technologies  instead of purchasing commercial software products 
as a result of these factors and others  our software license and service revenues have declined  despite the significant returns that our data analysis solutions can provide 
to compensate  we are focusing our resources in on higher value initiatives in the three industries that currently account for the majority of our revenues life sciences  securities and banking  and defense intelligence 
to broaden the type of data analysis problems that our products can handle  we undertook initiatives to expand our portfolio of products beyond statistics to encompass data mining and knowledge access 
as a result  in the first half of  we ve augmented s plus with the newly released insightful miner and infact  to address the emerging need to analyze structured numerical and unstructured linguistic and textual data sets 
initial sales for these new products  though encouraging  have not met our objectives 
we will continue to invest in both our existing and new products  as well as in expanding our sales and marketing efforts  but at slower pace than historical levels 
looking forward  we expect that our professional services revenue will remain at its current depressed levels until there is a sustained economic recovery for it spending 
however  we anticipate that growth will resume for our software license and maintenance revenues  and will be predominantly driven by increased resources and efficiency of our sales and marketing efforts worldwide  and subject to our efficiency in closing deals and winning new customers for our products 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost that is associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
it supersedes the guidance in eitf issue no 
under eitf  an entity recognized a liability for an exit cost on the date that the entity committed itself to an exit plan 
under sfas  an entity s commitment to a plan does not  by itself  create a present obligation to other parties that meets the definition of a liability 
sfas also establishes that fair value is the objective for the initial measurement of the liability 
sfas will be effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  in november  the fasb s emerging issues task force finalized eitf issue no 
eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf addresses how to determine whether an arrangement involving multiple deliverables contains more than one unit of accounting 
eitf also addresses how arrangement consideration should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting in the arrangement 
however  it does not address when the criteria for revenue recognition are met or provide guidance on the appropriate revenue recognition convention for a given unit of accounting 
eitf is effective for all revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june   and early application is permitted 
upon adoption  entities may elect to either apply eitf prospectively or report the change in accounting as a cumulative effect adjustment 
the adoption of eitf is not expected to have a significant impact on us 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
  and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
fin elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees  including loan guarantees such as standby letters of credit and warranty obligations 
it also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee  a company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value of the obligations it assumes under that guarantee and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements 
the provisions of fin relating to initial recognition and measurement must be applied on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  we do not expect the adoption of the initial recognition and measurement provisions in the first quarter of to have a significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
the disclosure requirements of fin  which are effective for both interim and annual periods that end after december   were adopted by us for the year ended december  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting and annual disclosure provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years ending after december  in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
we will continue to account for stock based compensation to employees under apb opinion no 
and related interpretations 
we adopted the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
as of december  in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin is required to be applied to preexisting entities of the company as of the beginning of the first quarter after june  fin is required to be applied to all new entities with which the company becomes involved beginning february  we currently believe the adoption of fin will not have a significant impact on the company 
we believe the interpretive accounting guidance necessary for fin will continue to evolve 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we develop products in the united states and sell them worldwide 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
since our sales are currently priced in us dollars and translated into local currency amounts  a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
we operate in the united kingdom  germany  france and switzerland and incur expenses denominated in those local currencies 
however  we do not believe that these operating expenses will harm our results of operations 
interest income and expense are sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the company s investments are in short term instruments 
based on the short term nature and current levels of our investments and debt  however  we do not believe that there is any material market risk or exposure 
our general investing policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting credit and market risk 
we currently invest in highly liquid money market accounts and short term investments 
all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents
