goodwill and other intangibles on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
with the adoption of statement  we implemented the necessary reclassifications in order to conform to the new criteria in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  for recognition of intangible assets apart from goodwill 
statement requires that companies no longer amortize goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives  but instead test goodwill impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
statement also requires completion of a two step transitional goodwill impairment test 
in connection with completion of the first step of our transitional analysis  we identified two reporting units with goodwill  large systems and small systems  these reporting units are also reportable segments 
we then determined the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including existing goodwill and other intangible assets  to these reporting units as of the date of adoption 
completion of the first step of our analysis indicated impairment in the carrying amount of our goodwill 
our goodwill was primarily associated with our large systems segment which consists primarily of uninterruptible power supply ups  dc power systems  and precision cooling products for data centers  facilities  and communication applications 
conditions contributing to the goodwill impairment included the ongoing softness in it and communications market segments coupled with lower corporate investment for these types of applications 
in connection with completion of the second step of our transitional analysis  we compared the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill with the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill  both of which were measured as of the date of adoption 
the implied fair value of goodwill was determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with the provisions of statement the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
based on this second step  we recorded a non cash charge equal to the goodwill balance associated with our large systems segment of approximately million approximately million on an after tax basis 
this charge was recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle net of income taxes  included in apc s results as of january   and had no effect on our liquidity 
our remaining goodwill is associated with our small systems segment 
we evaluate each of our reporting units with goodwill during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
statement also provides for other intangible assets with definite useful lives to be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values and to be reviewed for impairment in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 impairment on disposal of long lived assets 
our other intangible assets consist principally of technology and licensed patent rights relating to uninterruptible power supply technology 
with the adoption of statement  we reduced the estimated useful lives of our other intangible assets with definite useful lives from a weighted average life of approximately years to a weighted average life of approximately years 
there are no expected residual values related to these intangible assets 
long lived assets on january   we adopted statement  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
statement retains the requirements of statement to recognize an impairment loss only if the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable from its undiscounted cash flows  and to measure an impairment loss as the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset 
an impairment loss is recognized only if the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
the carrying amount of a long lived asset is deemed not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
that assessment is based on the carrying amount of the asset at the date it is tested for recoverability 
we evaluate our long lived assets if impairment indicators arise 
statement also sets forth criteria to determine when a long lived asset is to be deemed held for sale 
such criteria specify that the asset must be available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such assets 
in addition  the sale of the asset must be probable  and its transfer expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale  generally within one year 
in  we announced our decision to consolidate our philippines based manufacturing operations resulting in the closing of apc s manufacturing facility in the province of laguna 
in connection with this action as well as the closure of manufacturing facilities in the us and us  we recorded million of asset impairment charges related to buildings and equipment of which million and million were classified in cost of goods sold and operating expenses  respectively 
these impairment charges have not been allocated to our operating segments  but rather have been classified as indirect operating expenses for segment reporting consistent with our classification for our internal financial reporting 
at december   a building and equipment held for sale with an aggregate value of million are stated at the lower of their fair values less estimated selling costs or carrying amounts  and depreciation is no longer recognized 
we expect to complete our sale of these assets  located in the philippines  in comparison of the years ended december   and the following table sets forth key data  expressed as a percentage of net sales  for the years ended december   and net sales cost of goods sold gross profit marketing  selling  general administrative expenses special charges research development operating income other income  net earnings before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change earnings before cumulative effect of accounting change net income revenues net sales in fiscal year decreased by to  million from  million in fiscal year which was lower than  million in fiscal year net sales in each year included sales attributable to acquisitions  also refer to acquisitions below 
our fiscal year net revenue continued to be impacted by softness in it and communications market segments 
our small systems business  which provides power protection  uninterruptible power supply ups  and management products for the pc  server  and local area networking markets  was negatively impacted in fiscal years  and by industry softness in the it markets  weakening global economies  and maturing markets 
the rate of growth in the large systems segment  consisting primarily of ups  dc power systems  and precision cooling products for data centers  facilities  and communication applications  was negatively impacted in fiscal years and by the significant reduction in corporate investment for these types of applications  particularly in the second half of and again in this negative impact was partially offset for fiscal year by the inclusion of incremental revenue activity attributable to the acquisitions of advance power and networkair  formerly airflow company  which were acquired in the second and fourth quarters of  respectively 
despite decreased net sales in and  sales of new products contributed to overall net sales in and sales of products introduced during  and represented approximately   and  respectively  of net sales in those years 
on a geographic basis  the americas north and latin america represented   and of total net sales for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the americas decreased in from  and decreased in from europe  the middle east and africa emea represented   and of total net sales for fiscal years  and  respectively 
emea increased in from  and decreased in from finally  asia was   and of total net sales for fiscal years  and  respectively 
asia decreased in from  and decreased in from in fiscal year  on a constant currency basis  emea decreased and asia decreased from in fiscal year  on a constant currency basis  emea decreased and asia increased from total sales to unaffiliated customers outside the us  primarily in europe  the far east  south america  and canada  in fiscal year were million or of net sales compared to million or of net sales in fiscal year and million or of net sales in fiscal year also refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold was million or of net sales in fiscal year compared to million or of net sales in fiscal year and million or of net sales in fiscal year gross margins for fiscal year were of net sales  approximately basis points higher than in fiscal year  for fiscal year  gross margins were of net sales  approximately basis points lower than in fiscal year the gross margin improvement was associated with gross margin improvements in both the small and large system segments 
the gross margin improvement in the small systems segment over was primarily attributable to and driven by product cost reduction efforts 
these cost reductions were achieved through a combination of product transitions to low cost manufacturing locations and material cost reductions from apc s supplier base 
also contributing to the overall improvement was favorable product mix in the underlying product lines to higher margin products 
the gross margin improvement in the large systems segment over was primarily the result of a continual lowering of product costs achieved through factory consolidations and capacity rationalization efforts that were begun in late in addition  to a lesser extent  the improvement over was assisted by the favorable pricing impact of a weakening us dollar  particularly in europe 
the gross margin erosion was associated with product mix shifts to lower margin products  principally the continued growth of our lower gross margin large system segment in  the effect of pro active small systems consumer product price cuts in and  and manufacturing inefficiencies from continued global capacity expansion prior to our capacity rationalization efforts which commenced during the second half of fiscal year gross margins included the effects of a fourth quarter charge for estimated costs associated with the product recall of back ups cs and models of approximately million  a fourth quarter charge for impairment of assets held for sale of approximately million  and first quarter charges for restructuring costs of approximately million 
these charges have not been allocated to our operating segments  but rather have been classified as indirect operating expenses for segment reporting consistent with our classification for our internal financial reporting 
these charges were the result of events or assessments that occurred during the respective quarters of our restructuring costs and asset impairment charges were associated with our decision to consolidate our philippines based manufacturing operations  resulting in the closing of apc s manufacturing facility in the province of laguna  as well as the closure of manufacturing facilities in the us and us our restructuring actions were announced and substantially completed during we anticipate the final settlements of our restructuring actions to be completed by no later than the end of due to the timing of the facilities closures and contractual or regulatory obligations to certain workers  the financial benefits of these actions did not commence until the second quarter of with most of the full benefit being realized by the close of the fiscal year 
also refer to notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
additionally  fiscal year gross margins included the effects of third quarter charges for excess inventory of million and restructuring costs of million 
these charges have not been allocated to our operating segments  but rather have been classified as indirect operating expenses for segment reporting consistent with our classification for our internal financial reporting 
these charges were the result of events or assessments that occurred during the third quarter of the charge for excess inventory related to specifically identified finished goods and raw materials inventories 
the inventories subject to the write off were categorized as follows million of residual  unusable quantities located at facilities impacted by downsizing actions  million of unusable or unsaleable quantities related to declining and changing demand requirements  and million of custom finished goods impacted by canceled sales orders  primarily from customers in the telecom and internet infrastructure industries 
there were no additional inventory charges  other than apc s standard provisioning  during the fourth quarter of or during fiscal year as of december   approximately million of inventories included in the third quarter charge were physically disposed 
disposition of the remaining inventories has continued into  we anticipate that all excess inventory will be physically disposed by no later than the end of our restructuring costs were associated with manufacturing downsizing actions in denmark and the uk and included the effects of employee terminations  facilities closures  and the related impairment of tangible and intangible assets 
our restructuring actions were announced and substantially completed in the third quarter of  and the final settlements of such restructuring actions were completed during due to the timing of the facilities closures and contractual or regulatory obligations to certain workers  the financial benefits of these actions did not commence until the fourth quarter of and continued to phase in gradually during also refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
total inventory reserves at december  were million compared to million at december  this increase was due primarily to routine provisioning that was necessary as a result of applying apc s inventory reserve methodology throughout the year 
apc s reserve estimate methodology involves quantifying the total inventory position having potential loss exposure 
loss exposure generally results from several business factors  including product or component discontinuance  unplanned changes in demand  product design changes  and factory transitions 
quantifying such loss exposure is the result of combining the cost of inventories specifically identified as having little or no opportunity for sale or use thus available for physical disposition plus the cost of inventories having a high risk of no future sale or use based upon an analysis of on hand quantities compared to historical and anticipated future sale or use 
apc maintains an on going business process for the physical disposition of inventories previously identified 
inventory write offs occur at the time of physical disposition 
inventories  once reserved  are not written back up as such reserve adjustments are considered to be a permanent decrease to the cost basis of the excess or obsolete inventory 
segment results also refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report for important information regarding apc s reportable segments net sales for products in the small systems segment  which provides power protection  ups  and management products for the pc  server  and local area networking markets  decreased in fiscal year by from  and decreased in fiscal year by from the overall decreases in and were impacted by industry softness in the it markets  weakening global economies  and maturing markets 
profits as a percentage of net sales for the small systems segment improved in over the prior year levels primarily reflecting product cost reduction efforts 
these cost reductions were achieved through a combination of product transitions to low cost manufacturing locations and material cost reductions from apc s supplier base 
also contributing to the overall improvement was favorable product mix in the underlying product lines to higher margin products 
profits as a percentage of net sales for the small systems segment declined in from comparable levels in as a result of pro active price reductions in combined with a mix shift within the segment toward lower margin products 
net sales for products in the large systems segment  consisting primarily of ups  dc power systems  and precision cooling products for data centers  facilities  and communication applications  decreased in fiscal year compared to  and increased in fiscal year over the decline in and rate of growth during were negatively impacted by the significant reduction in corporate investment for these types of applications  particularly in and the second half of losses for the large systems segment declined in reflecting a continual lowering of product costs achieved through factory consolidations and capacity rationalization efforts that were begun in late this segment reported losses in compared to profits in due to cost inefficiencies resulting from global capacity expansion  coupled with declining sales volumes  particularly in the second half of also contributing to losses were the continued investment in product and business development initiatives for this business segment in  as well as the restructuring costs discussed above associated with manufacturing downsizing actions in denmark and the uk which included the effects of employee terminations  facilities closures  and the related impairment of tangible and intangible assets 
in the fourth quarter of  we acquired select inventory and related technology associated with outside plant  networking power product lines from arris group  inc for million paid in cash 
the product lines were acquired from arris energylink family of power supplies  enclosures and equipment for network broadband power  including the tsp total system power line 
the product lines are designed for outdoor use  commonly installed on utility poles or adjacent to fiber nodes  and provide back up power for broadband cable applications 
the combination of the arris product line and apc s powershield products provide a comprehensive broadband power product line 
beginning in  both offerings are included in the large systems segment 
prior to  our powershield products were classified in the small systems segment 
in  the powershield products were reclassified to the large systems segment along with the other broadband solutions from the arris acquisition which share similar product applications and economic characteristics more closely matching the large systems segment 
operating expenses marketing  selling  general  and administrative sg a expenses in fiscal year were million or of net sales compared to million or of net sales in fiscal year and million or of net sales in fiscal year the decrease in total spending from to reflects focused efforts to control expenses while improving the productivity and efficiency of our global resources 
reduced spending in compared to resulted primarily from lower advertising  promotional  and other operating costs of our marketing and selling functions combined with decreased investment in it support  partially offset by increased investment in administrative support 
reduced spending in compared to resulted principally from lower spending on administrative support  partially offset by increased investment in sales personnel and distribution costs as well as increased investment in it support 
during the third and second quarters of  we agreed to license worldwide patent rights relating to uninterruptible power supply technology for lump sum cash payments of million and million  respectively 
these license fees were paid from operating cash during the third and second quarters of apc evaluated the portion of the license fees that represented payment for prior use of the subject technology and the portion that represented payment for future use 
considering each of our markets and the historical and projected revenue realized in markets utilizing the licensed technology  we estimated the present value of royalty payments  basing this calculation on an appropriate royalty rate and the technology s contribution to the overall value of affected products 
separate present values were calculated for both historic and projected product sales  the historic values were expensed and the projected values were capitalized 
accordingly  write offs of the fully paid up portions of the patent licenses were recognized in our consolidated statements of income for the third and second quarters of as special charges to pre tax earnings of million and million  respectively  including direct expenses of million and million  respectively 
the remaining balances of million and million have been classified on the consolidated balance sheet as long term assets and are being amortized on a straight line basis over three years and nine years  respectively  the estimated remaining economic lives of the patent licenses 
the allowance for bad debts was of gross accounts receivable at december  compared to at december  accounts receivable balances outstanding over days represented of total receivables at december  compared to at december  this decrease reflects a product mix shift away from our large systems business  which typically carries longer sales cycles and collection cycles  along with an increased collection effort  offset in part by a growing portion of our business originating in areas where longer payment terms are customary  including a growing contribution from international markets 
we continue to experience strong collection performance 
write offs of uncollectable accounts represent less than of net sales 
while a majority of international customer balances continue to be covered by receivables insurance  the amount of covered receivables outside the us declined in from comparable levels in r d expenditures were million or of net sales in fiscal year  million or of net sales in fiscal year  and million or of net sales in fiscal year the increases in total r d spending primarily reflects increased numbers of software and hardware engineers and other costs associated with new product development and engineering support  combined with costs incremental in attributable to advance power and networkair  formerly airflow company  which were acquired in the second and fourth quarters of  respectively 
other income  net and income taxes other income is comprised principally of interest income combined with a million gain in fiscal year on the sale of a building in billerica  massachusetts 
although average cash balances available for investment rose during fiscal years and  interest income decreased substantially from to due to lower short term interest rates continuing throughout and at december   apc had million of total cash and investments  all of which are stated at fair value 
we manage apc s cash and investment balances to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing our return on the total investment portfolio 
we diversify our investment portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities with multiple investment brokers 
based on apc s investment portfolio and interest rates at december   a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would have resulted in an increase or decrease of approximately million in our annual interest income 
our effective income tax rates were approximately   and in  and  respectively 
the decrease from to is due to the tax savings from an increasing portion of taxable earnings being generated from apc s operations in jurisdictions currently having lower income tax rates than the present us statutory income tax rate 
this shift resulted partially from our product transitions to lower cost  lower tax  manufacturing locations 
effects of inflation management believes that inflation has not had a material effect on apc s operations 
liquidity and financial resources working capital at december  was million compared to million at december  apc has been able to increase its working capital position as the result of continued positive operating results and despite internally financing the capital investment required to expand its operations 
our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments position increased to million at december  from million at december  worldwide inventories were million at december   down from million at december  during  our finished goods planning better aligned inventory levels with anticipated demand resulting in lower finished goods inventories  principally ups and surge products 
the decreases in finished goods inventories were partially offset by increases in on hand raw materials to support current and anticipated demand for our three phase systems including powerstruxure and other related products 
there were no inventory charges  other than apc s standard provisioning  during fiscal year inventory levels as a percentage of quarterly sales were in the fourth quarter of  up slightly from in the third quarter of and down from in the fourth quarter of we announced a product recall of back ups cs and models in early due to potential safety issues 
apc has received eight reports worldwide of units overheating  resulting in the melting of the unit s outer casing  six of which occurred in the united states 
three of the reported incidents resulted in minor property damage  no injuries have been reported 
the total number of affected devices being recalled worldwide is approximately million with approximately  devices recalled in the united states 
the recall is limited to two specific models in apc s back ups cs product line  the back ups cs and the back ups cs  in both volt and volt models 
the affected units were manufactured between november and december and were sold primarily through computer and electrical distribution  catalog and retail outlets worldwide 
our methodology for estimating costs associated with this product recall involved estimating future costs to be incurred to replace the recalled products based on expected returns and the costs to conduct the recall  particularly repair and transportation costs 
our repair and transportation cost estimates include costing for component parts and inside labor  we also obtained third party cost quotes for outside labor and freight 
the expected percentage of units to be returned out of the total population of units is an important assumption 
our current assumption is that approximately of domestic units in the hands of end users and approximately of international units will be exchanged 
to help understand the relative impact of the return rate assumption  a percentage point increase in the worldwide return rate would increase the estimated recall costs from million to million 
we have accrued a current liability and recognized additional warranty expense which is classified in cost of goods sold 
we expect apc s cash outlays associated with this product recall to be financed from operating cash 
actual amounts may differ materially from our current estimates 
at december  and  we had available for future borrowings million under an unsecured line of credit agreement at a floating interest rate equal to the bank s cost of funds rate plus and an additional million million in under an unsecured line of credit agreement with a second bank at similar interest rates 
no borrowings were outstanding under these facilities during fiscal years  and  or at december  and apc had no significant financial commitments  other than those required in the normal course of business  during fiscal years  and  or at december  and apc has several non cancelable operating leases  primarily for warehousing and office space  expiring at various dates through these leases contain renewal options for periods ranging from one to nine years and require apc to pay its proportionate share of utilities  taxes  and insurance 
future minimum lease payments under these non cancelable leases are million  million  million  million  million  and million thereafter 
during and  our capital expenditures  net of capital grants  amounted to approximately million and million  respectively  consisting primarily of manufacturing and office equipment  buildings and improvements  and purchased software applications 
capital spending in decreased from prior year levels  reflecting our focused efforts to control and reduce capital spending and rationalize our overall production capacity which included our first quarter decision to consolidate our philippines based manufacturing operations in the province of cavite 
capital spending in focused on improving manufacturing capabilities  principally in brazil and india  as well as funding it related capital equipment and software purchases to support business process improvement initiatives  capital spending during included large systems segment global capacity expansion into lower cost locations closer to local end user customers and markets 
substantially all of apc s net capital expenditures were financed from available operating cash 
we had no material capital commitments during fiscal years  and  or at december  and apc has agreements with the industrial development authority of ireland  otherwise known as the ida 
under these agreements  we receive grant monies for costs incurred for machinery  equipment  and building improvements for our galway and castlebar facilities 
these grants are equal to and  respectively  of such costs up to a maximum of million for galway and million for castlebar 
such grant monies are subject to apc meeting certain employment goals and maintaining operations in ireland until termination of the respective agreements 
under separate agreements with the ida  we receive direct reimbursement of training costs at our galway and castlebar facilities for up to  and  respectively  per new employee hired 
also refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
we believe that current internal cash flows together with available cash  available credit facilities or  if needed  the proceeds from the sale of additional equity  will be sufficient to support anticipated capital spending and other working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
acquisitions in the fourth quarter of  apc acquired privately held airflow company  a maryland based manufacturer of precision cooling equipment primarily used in data center  internet  and telecommunications applications  for million in cash plus expenses  of which million will be paid in in the event no indemnity claims arise 
early in the second quarter of  apc acquired privately held advance power ltd  a uk based manufacturer of dc based power solutions used in communications and internet applications  for million in cash plus expenses 
also early in the second quarter of  apc acquired privately held abl electronics corporation abl  a north american provider of computer and network cables  switches  and other connectivity products  for million paid in a combination of cash and stock  plus expenses 
apc s cash outlays associated with these acquisitions were financed from operating cash 
at december  and  the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the tangible net assets acquired was included in large systems goodwill for the airflow and advance power acquisitions and small systems goodwill for the abl acquisition  and was being amortized on a straight line basis over years 
in connection with its adoption in of statement  apc recorded a non cash charge equal to the goodwill balance associated with its large systems segment 
this charge was recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle net of income taxes  included in apc s results as of january   and had no effect on apc s liquidity 
also effective january   in accordance with the provisions of statement  goodwill associated with apc s small systems segment is no longer being amortized but instead tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise  also refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
these acquisitions have been accounted for as purchases and  accordingly  the acquired companies results of operations are included in apc s consolidated financial statements from the respective dates of acquisition 
in the fourth quarter of  we acquired select inventory and related technology associated with outside plant  networking power product lines from arris group  inc for million paid in cash 
the product lines were acquired from arris energylink family of power supplies  enclosures and equipment for network broadband power  including the tsp total system power line 
our cash outlays associated with this purchase were financed from operating cash 
foreign currency activity we invoice our customers in various currencies 
realized and unrealized transaction gains or losses are included in the results of operations and are measured based upon the effect of changes in exchange rates on the actual or expected amount of functional currency cash flows 
transaction gains and losses were not material to the results of operations in  and at december   apc s unhedged foreign currency accounts receivable  by currency  were as follows in thousands foreign us currency dollars european euros   japanese yen   swiss francs   british pounds   apc also had non trade receivables denominated in irish pounds of approximately us million  liabilities denominated in various european currencies of approximately us million  and liabilities denominated in japanese yen of approximately us million 
we continually review our foreign exchange exposure and consider various risk management techniques  including the netting of foreign currency receipts and disbursements  rate protection agreements with customers vendors and derivatives arrangements  including foreign exchange contracts 
we presently do not utilize rate protection agreements or derivative arrangements 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the us securities and exchange commission has defined critical accounting policies as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and which require our most difficult  complex or subjective judgments or estimates 
based on this definition  we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for all financial statement periods presented  there have been no material modifications to the application of these critical accounting policies 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  also refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
on an on going basis  we evaluate the judgments and estimates underlying all of our accounting policies  including those related to revenue recognition  product returns  bad debts  inventories  impairment of long lived assets  deferred tax valuation allowances  restructuring reserves and contingencies  and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
materially different results in the amount and timing of our actual results for any period could occur if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition we follow very specific and detailed guidelines in measuring revenue  however  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue policy 
revenue results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
in general  revenue is recognized when title has passed at the time of delivery of product for all of our operating segments as stipulated by the delivery terms for the sales transactions 
in addition  prior to revenue recognition  we require persuasive evidence of the arrangement  that the price is fixed or determinable  and that collectibility is reasonably assured 
installation is not applicable for small systems and other segment products based on the nature of the products sold 
generally  revenue associated with large systems sales is also recognized at the time of delivery pursuant to the delivery terms  as we do not perform installation 
delivery terms vary  but often include origin based terms eg  fob shipping point and ex works and destination based terms eg  ddu ddp delivered duty unpaid delivered duty paid 
certain large systems product lines and  at times  one product line included in the small systems segment require electrical hardwire installation or duct installation which is performed by the customer or their contracted licensed contractor electrician 
since we do not perform the installation  revenue recognition at the time of delivery is proper as customer acceptance of the unit is not required 
also  payment by the customer is not contingent upon installation of the product 
we offer additional services to customers depending on the type of product the customer has purchased  including on site services  installation consulting services  remote monitoring services  power audit services  and network integration services 
revenue is recognized at the time services are provided or is deferred and recognized over the service period where applicable 
the fair value of these services are based upon the rates that we charge customers in separately negotiated transactions and such services are not essential to the functionality of the delivered product 
for all sales  except those completed over the internet  we use a binding purchase order as evidence of an arrangement 
for sales over the internet  we use a credit card authorization as evidence of an arrangement 
sales through certain customers are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with binding purchase orders on a transaction by transaction basis 
our arrangements do not generally include acceptance clauses 
however  if an arrangement includes a customer specified acceptance provision  acceptance generally occurs at our factory prior to delivery 
as we introduce new products in  we anticipate that installation and customer acceptance provisions may become more common  and therefore increasingly significant for determining delivery and performance and consequently our entitlement to recognize revenue 
in consideration of guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board s emerging issues task force in issue no 
 vendor income statement characterization of consideration paid to a reseller of the vendor s products  issue no 
 accounting for certain sales incentives  and issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products  certain customer promotional payments  rebates and other discounts formerly classified as operating expenses have been retroactively re classified as a reduction of revenue 
these changes reduced net sales and also reduced marketing  selling  general and administrative expenses by million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
this accounting change had no impact on reported profit from operations  net income or earnings per share for any of the periods presented 
estimating valuation allowances and accrued liabilities allowances for sales returns  doubtful accounts  inventory obsolescence and product recall  and assessment of the probability of the outcome of our current litigation significant management judgments that affect the application of our revenue policy also include estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue 
we analyze historical returns  current economic trends  and channel inventories when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and other allowances 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
we provide limited rights of return to distributors and retailers for our small systems product lines 
we provide appropriate reserves for returns at the time that related revenue is recognized  based on historical patterns of returns and contractual provisions in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  and us securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
returns of large systems products generally do not occur 
historically  returns have represented of gross sales and have not differed significantly from prior estimates 
similarly  we must make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts receivables 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable balances in view of customer credit worthiness  customer concentrations  historical bad debts  current economic trends  and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
while the amount of covered receivables outside the us declined in from comparable levels in  a majority of international customer balances are covered by receivables insurance 
our inventory reserve estimate methodology involves quantifying the total inventory position having potential loss exposure 
loss exposure generally results from several business factors  including product or component discontinuance  unplanned changes in demand  product design changes  and factory transitions 
quantifying such loss exposure is the result of combining the cost of inventories specifically identified as having little or no opportunity for sale or use thus available for physical disposition plus the cost of inventories having a high risk of no future sale or use based upon an analysis of on hand quantities compared to historical and anticipated future sale or use 
we maintain an on going business process for the physical disposition of inventories previously identified 
inventory write offs occur at the time of physical disposition 
inventories  once reserved  are not written back up as such reserve adjustments are considered to be a permanent decrease to the cost basis of the excess or obsolete inventory 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
in early  we announced a product recall of back ups cs and models 
our methodology for estimating costs associated with this product recall involved estimating future costs to be incurred to replace the recalled products based on expected returns and the costs to conduct the recall  particularly repair and transportation costs 
our repair and transportation cost estimates include costing for component parts and inside labor 
we also obtained third party cost quotes for outside labor and freight 
the expected percentage of units to be returned out of the total population of units is an important assumption 
our current assumption is that approximately of domestic units in the hands of end users and approximately of international units will be exchanged 
to help understand the relative impact of the return rate assumption  a percentage point increase in the worldwide return rate would increase the estimated recall costs from million to million 
we have accrued a current liability and recognized additional warranty expense which is classified in cost of goods sold 
actual amounts may differ materially from our current estimates 
we are  and may in the future become  involved in litigation involving our business  products or operations 
for pending claims for which there is an estimatable range of loss greater than zero  we record the best estimate of liability within the range 
if no point within the range is considered the best estimate  we record the minimum estimated liability 
because of uncertainties related to the identifiable range of loss on any pending claims  we may be unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability related to our pending claims and revise our estimates 
such revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operation and financial position 
the litigation process is uncertain and includes the risk of an unexpected  unfavorable result 
we may be materially adversely impacted by any such litigation 
valuation of long lived tangible and intangible assets including goodwill we assess the impairment of long lived tangible and intangible assets including goodwill on an ongoing basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
should our assessment suggest impairment  we would determine recoverability based on an estimate of future undiscounted cash flows resulting from our use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
factors we consider that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  and significant technological changes  which would render equipment and manufacturing process  obsolete 
on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
with the adoption of statement  we implemented the necessary reclassifications in order to conform to the new criteria in statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  for recognition of intangible assets apart from goodwill 
statement requires that companies no longer amortize goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives  but instead test goodwill impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
statement also requires completion of a two step transitional goodwill impairment test 
in connection with completion of the first step of our transitional analysis  we identified two reporting units with goodwill  large systems and small systems  these reporting units are also reportable segments 
we then determined the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including existing goodwill and other intangible assets  to these reporting units as of the date of adoption 
completion of the first step of our analysis indicated impairment in the carrying amount of our goodwill 
our goodwill was primarily associated with our large systems segment which consists primarily of uninterruptible power supply ups  dc power systems  and precision cooling products for data centers  facilities  and communication applications 
conditions contributing to the goodwill impairment included the ongoing softness in it and communications market segments coupled with lower corporate investment for these types of applications 
in connection with completion of the second step of our transitional analysis  we compared the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill with the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill  both of which were measured as of the date of adoption 
the implied fair value of goodwill was determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with the provisions of statement the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
based on this second step  we recorded a non cash charge equal to the goodwill balance associated with our large systems segment of approximately million approximately million on an after tax basis 
this charge was recognized as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle net of income taxes  included in apc s results as of january   and had no effect on our liquidity 
our remaining goodwill is associated with our small systems segment 
we evaluate each of our reporting units with goodwill during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
expectations about future taxable income incorporate numerous assumptions about actions  elections and strategies to minimize income taxes in future years 
our ability to take such actions  make preferred elections and implement tax planning strategies may be adversely impacted by enacted changes in tax laws and or tax rates  as well as successful challenges by tax authorities resulting from differing interpretations of tax laws and regulations 
to the extent we believe that recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statements of income 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
at december  and  we provided a valuation allowance on certain of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of net operating losses generated in and for the start up of brazilian operations  because of uncertainty regarding their realizability 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
recently issued accounting standards in november  the emerging issues task force reached a consensus on issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
this consensus addresses several issues including how to determine when a multiple arrangement exists and the proper accounting treatment 
the guidance in this consensus is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  adoption of the guidance in this consensus is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in november  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including guarantees of indebtedness of others 
disclosures related to this interpretation are effective for and the accounting requirements are effective january  the implementation of this interpretation is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
statement is required to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december   we will adopt this statement on january  the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in august  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   we will adopt this statement on january  the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
factors that may affect future results this document contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including the risks faced by us described below and elsewhere in this document 
we caution readers not to place undue reliance on any such forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date they are made 
we disclaim any obligation to publicly update or revise any such statements to reflect any change in our expectations or in events  conditions  or circumstances on which any such statements may be based  or that may affect the likelihood that actual results will differ from those set forth in the forward looking statements 
our annual and quarterly results are likely to be volatile 
our annual and quarterly operating results may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors  including costs incurred for the recent product recall are greater than or less than currently anticipated  ramp up  expansion and rationalization of global manufacturing capacity  our ability to effectively align operating expenses and production capacity with the current demand environment  volatility in general world economic conditions  and  in particular  the possibility that the pc and related markets decline more dramatically than currently anticipated  the growth rates in the power protection industry and related industries  including but not limited to the pc  server  networking  telecommunications and enterprise hardware industries  competitive factors and pricing pressures  product mix changes and the potential negative impact on gross margins from such changes  changes in the seasonality of demand patterns  inventory risks due to shifts in market demand  component constraints  shortages  and quality  risks of nonpayment of accounts receivable  timing of orders from  and shipments to  customers  timing of new product introductions and the market acceptance of those products  changes in manufacturing costs  factors associated with international operations  natural disasters  and labor disputes  acts of terrorism  war and political instability 
we currently compete with several firms providing power protection and related products and services and expect competition to increase in the future  which could affect our revenue and profitability 
we believe that we are one of less than ten global companies providing a full range of ups products and services worldwide 
the ups  power protection and related industries  however  are highly competitive on both a worldwide basis and a regional geographic basis 
we compete  and will continue to compete  with several us and foreign firms  both on a worldwide basis and in various geographical regions  and within individual product and application niches 
we expect competition to increase in the future from existing competitors and a number of companies that may enter our existing or future markets 
increased competition could adversely affect our revenue and profitability through price reductions and loss of market share 
the principal competitive factors in our products include product performance and quality  marketing and access to distribution channels  customer services  and product design and price 
some of our current and potential competitors may have substantially greater financial  technical  sales and marketing resources than we have 
we may not be able to continue to compete successfully with our existing competitors or with new competitors 
technological innovation  or failure to alter our products to meet the demands of technological innovation  could seriously harm our business 
the market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and frequent new product introductions 
current competitors or new market entrants may develop new products with features that could adversely affect the competitive position of our products 
we may not be successful in selecting  developing  manufacturing and marketing new products or enhancing our existing products or in responding effectively to technological changes  new standards or product announcements by competitors 
the timely availability of new products and enhancements  and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success 
delays in such availability or a lack of market acceptance could have an adverse effect on our business 
additionally  there may be technological innovation that eliminates or reduces the need for our products 
defects in our products could seriously harm our business 
our products may have defects despite testing internally or by current or potential customers 
these defects could result in product returns or recalls and loss or delay in market acceptance  which could have a material adverse effect upon our business  operating results  or financial condition 
in early  apc announced a product recall of back ups cs and models  due to potential safety issues 
apc has received eight reports worldwide of units overheating  resulting in the melting of the unit s outer casing  six of which occurred in the united states 
three of the reported incidents resulted in minor property damage  no injuries have been reported 
the total number of affected devices being recalled worldwide is approximately million with approximately  devices recalled in the united states 
the recall is limited to two specific models in apc s back ups cs product line  the back ups cs and the back ups cs  in both volt and volt models 
the affected units were manufactured between november and december and were sold primarily through computer and electrical distribution  catalog and retail outlets worldwide 
we have accrued a current liability and recognized additional warranty expense  classified in cost of goods sold  of million 
actual amounts may differ materially from our current estimates 
loss of any of our key personnel could seriously harm our business 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continuing contributions of key management  sales  marketing  research and development and manufacturing personnel  many of whom we would have difficulty replacing 
we believe that our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled hardware and software engineers  and management  sales  and marketing personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
failure to attract and retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  or financial condition 
because we depend on foreign operations and revenues  we are exposed to currency fluctuations  import barriers and other risks related to conducting foreign operations 
we manufacture and market our products worldwide through several foreign subsidiaries  distributors  and resellers 
our worldwide operations are subject to the risks normally associated with foreign operations including  but not limited to customer and vendor financial instability  volatility in general world economic conditions  the disruption of markets  changes in export or import laws  restrictions on currency exchanges  potentially negative tax consequences  longer payment terms  acts of war  terrorism  and political instability natural disasters  and the modification or introduction of government policies with potentially adverse effects 
international sales  which are both direct and indirect sales to customers outside the us  accounted for approximately   and of our net sales in  and  respectively 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue 
we invoice our customers in various currencies 
to date  we do not use any rate protection agreements or derivative agreements to hedge any foreign exchange exposure 
accordingly  we may be exposed to exchange losses based upon currency exchange rate fluctuations  which losses could have a materially adverse effect on our operating results 
a significant portion of products in our small systems and large systems reportable operating segments are manufactured in foreign locations  particularly developing countries such as brazil  china  india  and the philippines  which subject apc to a number of economic and other risks 
the small systems have particular exposure to the philippines  a country which is experiencing political and financial instability 
disruption of manufacturing efforts in these international facilities could materially adversely impact our ability to fulfill customer orders and potentially result in the loss of business 
because our business relies upon a variety of computer systems to operate effectively  the failure or disruption of  or latent defects in these systems could have a material adverse effect on our business 
apc is a highly automated company whose efficient and effective operation relies on a variety of information systems  including e mail  enterprise resource planning  electronic data interchange  customer resource management and e commerce systems 
disruption in the operation of these systems  or difficulties in maintaining or upgrading these systems  could have an adverse effect on our business 
in january  we upgraded our enterprise resource planning system 
difficulties that we have encountered  or may encounter  in connection with our implementation and use of our computer systems  including human error or our reliance on  or a failure or disruption of  or latent defects in such systems  could adversely affect our order management and fulfillment  financial reporting and supply chain management processes  and any such difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our reliance on sole source suppliers may result in product delays or price increases 
we currently obtain certain components of our products and certain finished products from sole sources 
in the future  our suppliers may not be able to meet our demand for components and products in a timely and cost effective manner 
our inability to secure and qualify alternative sources of supply in a timely manner may disrupt our ability to fulfill customer orders 
we generally purchase these sole source components and products using purchase orders and have no guaranteed supply arrangements with the suppliers 
in addition  the availability of many of these components and products is dependent in part on our ability to provide the suppliers with accurate forecasts of our future requirements 
however  our operating results and customer relationships could be materially adversely affected by either an increase in prices for  or an interruption or reduction in supply of  any key components and products 
we have a limited ability to protect our intellectual property rights  others could infringe on or misappropriate our propriety rights and information 
our success will depend  to a large extent  on our ability to protect our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of contractual rights  trade secrets  patents  and copyrights to protect our proprietary rights 
although we own certain patents  and we have applied  and in the future we may apply  for patents  our intellectual property protection may not be sufficient to prevent competitors from developing similar technology 
moreover  in the absence of patent protection  our business may be adversely affected by competitors which independently develop functionally equivalent technology 
our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of others 
we attempt to ensure that our products and processes do not infringe upon third party patents and other proprietary rights  but from time to time third parties have alleged  and in the future may allege  such infringement 
if third parties allege or determine infringement  we may not prevail in such a challenge 
furthermore  if infringement is determined  we may not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to identify and successfully integrate acquisitions  our ability to expand and our financial results could suffer 
we have limited experience in integrating acquired companies or technologies into our operations 
we may from time to time pursue the acquisition of other companies  assets  products or technologies 
we may not be able to integrate successfully products  technologies  distribution channels  key personnel and businesses of acquired companies into our business or product offerings 
in addition  the integration of acquired companies may adversely affect our business  operating results  or financial condition 
further  these acquired companies  assets  products or technologies may not contribute significantly to our sales or earnings  and the sales and earnings from acquired businesses may be adversely affected by the integration process or other factors 
if we are not successful in the integration of such acquired businesses  our financial results could be adversely impacted 
in addition  we may not be able to identify and consummate suitable acquisition transactions in the future 
our stock price could be volatile  which could cause you to lose part or all of your investment 
the market price of our common stock has been  and may continue to be  extremely volatile 
the trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  announcements of technological innovations or new products developed by us or our competitors  and labor disputes  acts of war  terrorism and political instability and other events or factors 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations which have particularly affected the market price for many high technology companies and which often have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our tax rate depends on earnings derived from certain foreign manufacturing operations 
our tax rate is heavily dependent upon the proportion of earnings that we derive from our ireland and philippines manufacturing operations and our ability to reinvest those earnings permanently outside the united states 
if the earnings of these operations as a percentage of our total earnings were to decline significantly from anticipated levels  or should our ability to reinvest these earnings be reduced  our effective tax rate would exceed the currently estimated rate for in addition  should our intercompany transfer pricing with respect to our ireland or philippines manufacturing operations require significant adjustment due to audits or regulatory changes  our overall effective tax rate could increase 
we are  and may become  involved in litigation  which could materially harm our business 
we are  and may in the future become  involved in litigation involving our business  products or operations 
the litigation process is uncertain and includes the risk of an unexpected  unfavorable result 
we may be materially adversely impacted by any such litigation
