goodwill and core deposit intangible assets of  and  respectively  were recorded in connection with this transaction 
the acquisition was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting  and accordingly  the consolidated financial statements include the assets and liabilities and results of operations from the acquisition date forward 
pro forma disclosures of the effects of this acquisition have not been presented as the amounts involved in this transaction were not material to the corporation s financial results 
critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of the corporation conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and general practices within the financial services industry 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgements are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgements 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgements and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
the corporation considers its critical accounting policies to include the following critical accounting policies continued allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents management s best estimate of probable losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for losses  on losses charged to expense and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
the provision for loan losses is determined based on management s assessment of several factors actual loss experience  changes in composition of the loan portfolio  evaluation of specific borrowers and collateral  current economic conditions  trends in past due and non accrual loan balances  and the results of recent regulatory examinations 
loans are considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable the corporation will not be able to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms 
the measurement of impaired loans is generally based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the historical effective interest rate stipulated in the loan agreement  except that all collateral dependent loans are measured for impairment based on the fair value of the collateral  less estimated cost to liquidate 
in measuring the fair value of the collateral  management uses assumptions and methodologies consistent with those that would be utilized by unrelated third parties 
changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers  in economic conditions  in historical loss experience and in the conditions of the various markets in which the collateral may be liquidated may all affect the required level of the allowance for loan losses and the associated provision for loan losses 
estimation of fair value the estimation of fair value is significant to several of the corporation s assets  including loans held for sale  investment securities available for sale  mortgage servicing rights  other real estate owned  as well as fair values associated with derivative financial instruments and goodwill and other intangibles 
these are all recorded at either fair value or the lower of cost or fair value 
fair values are determined based on third party sources  when available 
furthermore  accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require disclosure of the fair value of financial instruments as a part of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
fair values are volatile and may be influenced by a number of factors  including market interest rates  prepayment speeds  discount rates and the shape of yield curves 
fair values for securities available for sale are based on quoted market prices 
if a quoted market price is not available  fair values are estimated using quoted market prices for similar securities 
the fair values for loans held for sale are based upon quoted market values while the fair values of mortgage servicing rights are based on discounted cash flow analysis utilizing dealer consensus prepayment speeds and market discount rates 
the fair values of other real estate owned are typically determined based on appraisals by third parties  less estimated costs to sell 
the fair values of derivative financial instruments are estimated based on current market quotes

the corporation completed the loan sale during the corporation began a leverage program in in which medium and long term mortgage backed securities and agency and trust preferred securities were acquired with long term federal home loan bank advances and long term national market repurchase agreements 
during  the corporation announced that it was terminating the leverage program  reduced its dependency on non core funding sources and began taking other steps to reduce its sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
these steps included selling fixed rate  longer maturity  mortgage backed securities and reinvesting the proceeds in shorter maturity securities with a more stable and predictable cash flow 
gains from securities sales were used to cover the costs associated with prepaying million in long term debt and expenses incurred from the loan sale

changes in net interest income for the last two years are presented in the following schedule 
the change in net interest income not solely due to changes in volume or rates has been allocated in proportion to the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each

most of the proceeds were used to prepay  of term repurchase agreements  at a net cost of  the corporation recorded expenses of  in related to the loan sale project 
the writedown was precipitated primarily by the rapid deterioration in one commercial loan and lower than anticipated prices were realized on the remaining loans held for sale 
the loan sale project was completed in amortization of intangible assets was  in compared to  and  in and  respectively 
the decrease in  resulted from the corporation adopting sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill and certain other intangible assets having indefinite lives are no longer amortized to earnings  but rather are subject to testing for impairment 
the corporation completed this testing in and found no impairment 
the purchase of webster bancorp  inc in january and the full year effect of the branch purchase completed in november account for the increase in during the fourth quarter of  the corporation adopted sfas no 
 acquisitions of certain financial institutions  and  as required  reversed approximately of pre tax amortization expense incurred during the first nine months of other non interest expenses were  in  decreasing  or  from the prior year

financial condition total assets at december   were  compared to  at december  changes in the balance sheet mix from december  to december  were impacted by the selling of fixed rate  longer maturity  mortgage backed securities 
the proceeds were used to repay million of long term debt and remaining funds were reinvested in shorter duration  more predictable securities  completing the loan sale and commercial loan growth 
management believes these changes contributed to having a stronger balance sheet at year end short term investments the corporation maintained a short term liquidity position in anticipation of a high concentration of time deposits maturing in the first half of federal funds sold and other short term investments totaled at december  compared to  one year prior 
securities portfolio total investment securities  which are all classified as available for sale  comprised of earning assets at december  compared to at december  they represent the second largest earning asset component after loans 
securities decreased  to  at december  from one year prior 
the portfolio has continued to shift toward investments in mortgage backed securities  which generally have higher yields than comparable us government agencies 
inherent in mortgage backed securities is prepayment risk  which occurs when borrowers prepay their obligations due to market fluctuations and rates 
prepayment rates generally can be expected to increase during periods of lower interest rates as some of the underlying mortgages are refinanced at lower rates  which occurred in mortgage backed securities represented of the investment portfolio at december  as compared to and at december  and  respectively 
management repositioned a portion of the portfolio late in in order to reduce the exposure to unanticipated premium write downs going forward 
the corporation s present investment strategy focuses on shorter duration securities with predictable cash flows in a variety of interest rate scenarios 
december  securities portfolio at fair value us government agencies    mortgage backed securities    state political subdivisions    other securities    total    loans loans  net of unearned income at december  totaled  compared to  at year end  reflecting an increase of  as of december   the corporation identified  of performing and non performing loans which it intended to sell 
this portfolio consisted of  of commercial loans   of residential mortgage loans and of consumer loans 
the loans identified for sale in were written down to fair value  resulting in charge offs totaling  prior to being reclassified from the loan portfolio into loans held for sale 
during  the corporation sold approximately  of the loans held for sale and transferred  of performing loans back into the loan portfolio  as the corporation no longer had the intent to sell these loans 
in addition  during the same period the corporation wrote down the held for sale portfolio by a total of  this additional writedown was necessitated due to the rapid deterioration of a significant commercial credit in the portfolio  lower realization on the loans sold and lower estimated realization on the remaining loans held for sale 
net activity  including payments and disbursements  on these loans totaled in the loan sale was completed in loans continued loan portfolio at year end real estate loans      commercial  industrial and agricultural loans      economic development loans and other obligations of state and political subdivisions      consumer loans      direct lease financing      leveraged leases      other loans     total loans      less unearned income loans  net of unearned income      different types of loans are subject to varying levels of risk 
management mitigates this risk through portfolio diversification as well as geographic diversification 
the corporation concentrates its lending activity in the geographic market areas that it serves  primarily indiana  illinois  kentucky and southwestern ohio 
the loan portfolio is diversified by type of loan and industry 
the corporation lends to customers in various industries including manufacturing  agricultural  health and other related services  transportation  and mining 
there is no concentration of loans in any single industry exceeding of the portfolio nor does the portfolio contain any loans to finance speculative transactions  such as large  highly leveraged buyouts or loans to foreign countries 
loan maturities and rate sensitivities at december  on agricultural  commercial  and tax exempt loans after year within but within over rate sensitivities year years years total fixed rate loans     variable rate loans    subtotal     percent of total nonaccrual loans  total loans  non performing assets non performing assets consist primarily of nonaccrual loans  restructured loans  loans past due days or more and other real estate owned 
nonaccrual loans are loans on which interest recognition has been suspended because of doubts as to the borrower s ability to repay principal or interest 
loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status after becoming days past due if the ultimate collectibility of the loan is in question 
loans which are current  but as to which serious doubt exists about repayment ability  may also be placed on nonaccrual status 
restructured loans are loans for which the terms have been renegotiated to provide a reduction or deferral of principal or interest because of the borrower s financial position 
loans days or more past due are loans that are continuing to accrue interest  but which are contractually past due days or more as to interest or principal payments 
other real estate owned represents properties obtained for debts previously contracted 
management is not aware of any loans which have not been disclosed as non performing assets that represent or result from unfavorable trends or uncertainties which management reasonably believes will materially adversely affect future operating results  liquidity or capital resources  or represent material credits as to which management has serious doubt as to the ability of such borrower to comply with loan repayment terms 
a municipal bond non performing assets continued with an approximate value of million is in default 
management expects a full recovery to be realized after a rate issue is resolved by the courts 
non performing assets at year end non performing loans nonaccrual      restructured  days past due      total non performing loans      defaulted municipal securities  other real estate owned    total non performing assets      includes non performing loans classified as loans held for sale 
nonaccrual  restructured and past due loans were and of loans  net of unearned income at the end of and  respectively 
the improvement in the non performing loan to total loan ratio is due to the combination of aggressive management of non performing loans and the effect of the loan sale 
the interest recognized on nonaccrual loans was approximately  and  in  and  respectively 
in addition to those loans classified as non performing  the corporation recognizes accruing potential problem loans of approximately   and  as of december   and  respectively 
these potential problem loans have well defined weaknesses that are not believed to impair the ultimate collection of principal and interest 
credit management the corporation utilizes a centralized credit administration function and loan policies supervised by the board of directors 
board oversight of the lending function is the responsibility of the board s credit and risk management committee  which meets monthly 
the committee monitors credit quality through its review of information such as delinquencies  problem loans and charge offs 
the lending policies address risks associated with each type of lending  including collateralization  loan to value ratios  loan concentrations  insider lending and other pertinent matters and are regularly reviewed to ensure that they remain appropriate for the current lending environment 
in addition  the credit risk functions are monitored by integra bank credit review personnel  outsourced loan review  regulatory agencies and internal audit  for compliance as well as loan quality 
the allowance for loan losses is that amount which  in management s opinion  is adequate to absorb probable inherent loan losses as determined by management s ongoing evaluation of the loan portfolio 
the evaluation by management is based upon consideration of various factors including growth of the portfolio  an analysis of individual credits  adverse situations that could affect a borrower s ability to repay  prior and current loss experience  the results of recent regulatory examinations and economic conditions 
loans that are deemed to be uncollectible are charged to the allowance  while recoveries of previously charged off amounts are credited to the allowance 
a provision for loan losses is charged to operations at levels deemed necessary to provide assurance that the allowance for loan losses is sufficient to absorb probable losses based on management s ongoing evaluation of the loan portfolio 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based on ongoing quarterly assessments of the probable losses inherent in the credit portfolios 
the methodology for assessing the adequacy of the allowance establishes both an allocated and unallocated component 
the allocated component of the allowance for commercial loans is based on a review of specific loans as well as delinquency and historic charge offs for pools of non reviewed loans 
for consumer loans  the allocated component is based on loan payment status and historical loss rates 
a review of selected loans based on loan type and size is conducted to identify loans with heightened risk or probable losses 
the primary responsibility for this review rests with management assigned accountability for the credit relationship 
this review is supplemented with reviews by the credit review function and regulatory agencies 
these reviews provide information which assist in the timely identification of problems and potential problems and in deciding whether the credit represents a probable loss or risk which should be recognized 
where appropriate  an allocation is made to the allowance for individual loans based on management s estimate of the borrower s ability to repay the loan given the availability of collateral  other sources of cash flow and legal options available to the corporation 
credit management continued included in the review of individual loans are those that are impaired as provided in sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
loans are considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable the corporation will not be able to collect all amounts due in accordance with the contractual terms 
the allowance established for impaired loans is generally based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the historical effective interest rate stipulated in the loan agreement  except that all collateral dependent loans are measured for impairment based on the fair value of the collateral  less estimated cost to liquidate 
historical loss ratios are applied to other loans not subject to specific allowance allocations 
homogeneous pools of loans  such as consumer installment and residential real estate loans  are not individually reviewed 
an allowance is established for each pool of loans based upon historical loss ratios  based on the net charge off history by loan category 
in addition  the allowance reflects other risks affecting the loan portfolio  such as economic conditions in the corporation s geographic areas  specific industry financial conditions and other factors 
the unallocated portion of the allowance is determined based on management s assessment of economic conditions and specific economic factors in the individual markets in which the corporation operates 
during  the factors used to evaluate homogenous loans in accordance with the sfas no 
accounting for contingencies were updated  resulting in improved allocation of specific reserves 
the provision for loan losses is the amount necessary to adjust the allowance for loan losses to an amount that is adequate to absorb estimated loan losses as determined by management s periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio 
this evaluation by management is based upon consideration of actual loss experience  changes in composition of the loan portfolio  evaluation of specific borrowers and collateral  current economic conditions  trends in past due and non accrual loan balances and the results of recent regulatory examinations 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is reviewed on a quarterly basis and presented to the audit committee of the board of directors for approval 
the accounting policies related to the allowance for loan losses are significant policies that involve the use of estimates and a high degree of subjectivity 
management believes that they have developed appropriate policies and procedures for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses that reflect the assessment of credit risk after careful consideration of known relevant facts 
in developing this assessment  management must rely on estimates and exercise judgement regarding matters where the ultimate outcome is unknown such as economic factors  developments affecting companies in specific industries or issues with respect to single borrowers 
depending on changes in circumstances  future assessments of credit risk may yield different results  which may require an increase or decrease in the allowance for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses totaled  in  a decrease of  from the  provided in at december   the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans was as compared to as of year end during  the corporation s ratio of net charge offs to average loans was basis points compared to basis points in excluding the impact of the loan sale project 
the allowance for loan losses to non performing loans at december was in and in credit management continued summary of loan loss experience analysis of the allowance for loan losses allowance for loan losses  january      allowance associated with purchase acquisitions    writedowns related to loans transferred to loans held for sale  loans charged off commercial     real estate mortgage     consumer      direct lease financing total      recoveries on charged off loans commercial  real estate mortgage  consumer  direct lease financing total      net charge offs      provision for loan losses      allowance for loan losses  december      total loans at year end  net of unearned income      average loans      total non performing loans      net charge offs to average loans provision for loan losses to average loans allowance for loan losses to loans allowance for loan losses to non performing loans includes loans classified as held for sale

securities sold under agreements to repurchase are collateralized transactions acquired in national markets as well as from the corporation s commercial customers as a part of a cash management service 
repurchase agreements generally provide the corporation with a lower interest cost than similar sources of funds 
the corporation had repurchase agreements outstanding of  and  at december  and  respectively 
during  the reliance on this funding source was decreased mainly due to the prepayment of the longer term national market repurchase agreements

no repurchases were made in the average equity to average asset ratio was and for and  respectively 
though there were no material commitments for capital expenditures as of december   the possibility exists that capital expenditures may be incurred in to enhance our retail distribution network 
capital resources continued the corporation and the banking industry are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can elicit certain mandatory actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on the corporation s financial statements 
capital adequacy in the banking industry is evaluated primarily by the use of ratios that measure capital against assets and certain off balance sheet items 
certain ratios weight these assets based on risk characteristics according to regulatory accounting practices 
at december   the corporation and integra bank exceeded the regulatory minimums and integra bank met the regulatory definition of well capitalized 
liquidity liquidity of a banking institution reflects the ability to provide funds to meet loan requests  to accommodate possible outflows in deposits and other borrowings  and to take advantage of interest rate market opportunities 
funding loan requests  providing for liability outflows  and managing interest rate fluctuations require continuous analysis in order to match maturities of specific categories of short term and long term loans and investments with specific types of deposits and borrowings 
bank liquidity is normally considered in terms of the nature of mix of the banking institution s sources and uses of funds 
for integra bank  the primary sources of short term asset liquidity have been federal funds sold  commercial paper  interest bearing deposits and us government and agency securities available for sale 
in addition to these sources  short term asset liquidity is provided by maturing loans and securities 
the balance between these sources and needs to fund loan demand and deposit withdrawals is monitored under the corporation s asset liability management program 
when these sources are not adequate  the corporation may use federal funds purchased  brokered deposits  repurchase agreements  securities sales and its line with the fhlb as alternative sources of liquidity 
additionally  the corporation s underwriting standards for its mortgage loan portfolio comply with standards established by government housing agencies  as a result  a portion of the mortgage loan portfolio could be sold to provide additional liquidity 
at december  and  respectively  federal funds sold and other short term investments were and  additionally  at december   the corporation had  available from unused federal funds lines and in excess of  in unencumbered securities available for repurchase agreements 
liquidity for the corporation is provided by dividends from integra bank  cash balances  line of credit availability and access to the capital markets 
banking regulations impose restrictions on the ability of integra bank to pay dividends to the corporation 
the amount of dividends that could be paid is further restricted by management to maintain prudent capital levels 
as of december   integra bank was unable to pay dividends to the corporation without prior regulatory approval 
during  integra bank paid  in dividends to the corporation 
during  integra bank paid no dividends to the corporation 
the corporation has a  unsecured line of credit with an unaffiliated commercial bank that may be used from time to time to supplement the corporation s cash requirements 
the line was not in use at december  at december   the corporation was not in compliance with the return on assets debt covenant  however  the agreement for the line was amended subsequent to year end and effective december  and the corporation is in compliance with the financial covenants contained in the agreement as amended 
liquidity for the corporation is required to support operational expenses of the corporation  pay taxes  meet the outstanding debt and trust preferred securities obligations of the corporation  provide dividends to common shareholders and other general corporate purposes 
management believes that funds to fulfill these obligations for will be available from currently available cash and marketable securities  accessing the corporation s line of credit  requesting prior regulatory approval for integra bank to pay dividends to the corporation  or other sources that management expects to be available during the year 
while management believes that maintaining the current dividend level is important to the corporation s shareholders  the board of directors will determine on a quarterly basis whether to pay dividends and the amount of the dividend after taking into account the availability of funds  the results of current operations and prospects for future operations  and the need to maintain prudent capital levels at the corporation and integra bank

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk is the exposure of earnings and capital to changes in interest rates 
fluctuations in rates affect earnings by changing net interest income and other interest sensitive income and expense levels 
interest rate changes affect capital by altering the underlying value of assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments 
the interest rate risk management program for the corporation  which was redesigned and implemented during the second quarter of  is comprised of several components 
the components include board of directors oversight  senior management oversight  risk limits and control  risk identification and measurement  risk monitoring and reporting and independent review 
it is the objective of the corporation s interest rate risk management processes to manage the impact of interest rate volatility on bank earnings and capital 
at the corporation  interest rate risk is managed through the corporate asset and liability committee corporate alco with oversight through the alco committee of the board of directors board alco 
the board alco meets monthly and is responsible for the establishment of policies  risk limits and authorization levels 
the corporate alco meets at least monthly and is responsible for implementing policies and procedures  overseeing the entire interest rate risk management process and establishing internal controls 
interest rate risk is measured and monitored on a proactive basis by utilizing a simulation model 
the corporation uses the following key methodologies to measure interest rate risk 
earnings at risk ear 
ear is considered management s best source of managing short term interest rate risk one year time frame 
this measure reflects the dollar amount of net interest income that will be impacted by changes in interest rates 
the corporation uses a simulation model to run immediate and parallel changes in interest rates from a base scenario using implied forward rates 
the standard simulation analysis assesses the impact on net interest income over a month horizon by shocking the implied forward yield curve up and down   and basis points 
additional yield curve scenarios are tested from time to time to assess the risk to changes in the slope of the yield curve and changes in basis relationships 
these interest rate scenarios are executed against a balance sheet utilizing projected growth and composition 
additional simulations are run from time to time to assess the risk to earnings and liquidity from balance sheet growth occurring faster or slower than anticipated as well as the impact of faster or slower prepayments in the loan and securities portfolio 
this simulation model projects the net interest income forecasted under each scenario and calculates the percentage change from the base interest rate scenario 
the board alco has approved policy limits for changes in one year ear from the base interest rate scenario of minus percent to a basis point rate shock in either direction 
at december   the corporation would experience a negative change in ear  if interest rates moved downward basis points 
if interest rates moved upward basis points  the corporation would experience a positive change in net interest income 
both simulation results are within the policy limits established by the board alco 
prior to december  the corporation used the simulation model to calculate these changes assuming that rates and balance sheet composition remain unchanged 
the changes in ear using the unchanged rate and balance sheet composition assumptions produced risk measures that are materially the same as the risk measures produced by the current assumptions 
estimated change in ear from the flat interest rate scenario basis points basis points december  september  june  march  december  economic value of equity eve 
management considers eve to be its best analytical tool for measuring long term interest rate risk 
this measure reflects the dollar amount of net equity that will be impacted by changes in interest rates 
the corporation uses a simulation model to evaluate the impact of immediate and parallel changes in interest rates from a base scenario using implied forward rates 
the standard simulation analysis assesses the impact on eve by shocking the implied forward yield curve up and down   and basis points 
additional yield curve scenarios are tested from time to time to assess the eve risk to changes in the slope of the yield curve 
this simulation model projects the estimated economic value of assets and liabilities under each scenario 
the difference between the economic value of total assets and the economic value of total liabilities is referred to as the economic value of equity 
the simulation model calculates the percentage change from the base interest rate scenario 
the board alco has approved policy limits for changes in eve 
the variance limit for eve is measured in an environment when the base interest rate scenario is shocked up or down basis points 
the corporation uses a graduated monitoring system in determining the appropriate course of action for a given level of risk 
effective january   the board of directors updated and approved a policy that allows corporate alco to manage eve risk to a basis point rate shock within a range of plus or minus 
the discretionary limit prior to january  had been 
if eve risk to a basis point rate shock is greater than  but less than  management must present an explanation of reasons and causes of the variance and present alternative strategies or actions to reduce risk exposure to acceptable levels over time 
if eve risk to a basis point rate shock is greater than  management must bring board alco recommendations on specific actions to reduce the risk exposure to below by a specific date 
the policy limit prior to january  had been 
upon review and approval of board alco the action plan is implemented 
subsequent risk measurement will assess the effectiveness of the action plan and report to board and corporate alco significant deviations in updated risk measures compared to the action plan s anticipated results 
at december   the corporation would experience a negative change in eve if interest rates moved downward basis points 
if interest rates moved upward basis points  the corporation would experience a negative change in eve 
both of these measures are within board approved policy limits 
the impact of a basis point rate increase on eve has been significantly decreased in largely due to the balance sheet restructuring activities during the year 
prior to december  the corporation used the simulation model to calculate these changes assuming that rates remain unchanged 
for eve calculations  future balance sheet composition is not a factor 
the changes in eve using unchanged rates and balance sheet composition assumptions produced risk measures that are materially the same as the risk measures produced by the current assumptions 
estimated change in eve from the flat interest rate scenario basis points basis points december  september  june  march  december  the assumptions in any of these simulation runs are inherently uncertain 
any simulation cannot precisely estimate net interest income or economic value of the assets and liabilities or predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income or on the economic value of the assets and liabilities 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to the timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes  the difference between actual experience and the characteristics assumed  as well as changes in market conditions and management strategies 
during the first quarter of  the corporation entered into interest rate swap agreements totaling  notional amount to convert a portion of its liabilities from fixed rate to variable rate 
for purposes of the december  simulation modeling  the effect of the swap agreements was not included in the ear and the eve analysis 
the impact of the swaps was estimated to reduce one year ear to a basis point rate increase by percent 
the swaps were estimated to increase eve risk to a basis point rate increase by percent
