item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
you should read the cautionary statements made in this report as applying to related forward looking statements wherever they appear in this report 
our actual results may be materially different from the results we discuss in the forward looking statements due to various factors  including those discussed in the risk factors and other sections of this report 
overview we are a leading global designer  manufacturer and distributor of a broad range of plastic and glass eyeglass lenses and hold a leading manufacturing and technology position in the fast growing plastic lens segment of the global spectacle lens market 
we have sales offices in countries worldwide and operate in most major regions of the world 
we believe that we hold a top three market position in terms of volume of plastic eyeglass lenses sold in each major region where we operate north america  europe and rest of world consisting primarily of australia  asia and south america 
we focus our efforts on products with advanced design characteristics  lens coatings and treatments and thin and light weight materials 
we market our spectacle lens products globally under the brands sola and american optical ao and distribute them globally through four primary channels direct to national retail chains  direct to retail outlets  wholesale distributors eg  independent processing laboratories  and managed care organizations in the united states 
our business is organized into three primary markets north america  europe and rest of world 
for the fiscal year ended march   we generated approximately of our net sales from north america  from europe and from rest of world 
our business is somewhat seasonal  with fiscal third quarter results generally weaker than the other three quarters 
fiscal fourth quarter results are generally the strongest 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our estimates  judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience  however  actual amounts could differ from those estimates 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for losses that we estimate will arise from our customers inability to make required payments 
we make our estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable by analyzing historical bad debts  specific customer credit worthiness  transaction history with the customer and current economic trends 
at march   the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and  at march   it was million 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
in fiscal  our bad debt expense was million compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal valuation of inventory we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketablility 
the amount of such writedown is equal to the difference between cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand  selling prices and market conditions 
our inventories include components that may be subject to rapid technological obsolescence and that are sold in a highly competitive industry 
if actual product demand or selling prices are less favorable than we estimate  we may be required to record additional inventory write downs in the future 
significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological development could have a material and significant impact on the future value of our inventory and reported operating results 

table of contents accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that it is more likely than not that some or all of such assets will not be realized  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must reflect this adjustment within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of march   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain foreign net operating losses carried forward 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance  which could impact our financial position and results of operations 
the net deferred tax assets less deferred tax liabilities as of march  was million  net of a valuation allowance of million 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets at march   goodwill amounted to million and identifiable intangible assets amounted to million 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable  or at least annually in the case of goodwill 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
if we were to determine that the carrying value of intangibles or goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we would measure an impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
in fiscal  we elected to adopt statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  as a result  we ceased to amortize our goodwill 
we had recorded million of amortization on these amounts during fiscal in lieu of amortization  we performed an initial impairment review of our goodwill in fiscal and perform an impairment review annually 

table of contents retirement benefits our employee pension benefit costs and obligations are dependent on our assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include discount rates  inflation  salary growth  long term return on plan assets  retirement rates  mortality rates and other factors 
we base the discount rate assumptions on investment yields available at year end on corporate long term bond yields 
our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators 
the salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience  the near term outlook  and assumed inflation 
retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience 
actual results that may differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect our recognized expense and recorded obligation in those future periods 
while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions would affect our pension benefits costs and obligations 
see note of notes to our consolidated financial statements for more information regarding costs and assumptions for employee retirement benefits 
effective march   we discontinued any further accruals to the participants of its pension plan and all benefit levels as of a normal retirement date were frozen for all participants 
determining functional currencies for the purpose of consolidation in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to translate the financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries from the currency in which they keep their accounting records  generally the local currency  into united states dollars 
this process results in exchange gains and losses  which  under the relevant accounting guidance  are either included within the statement of operations or as a separate part of our net equity under the caption accumulated other comprehensive loss 
under the relevant accounting guidance  the treatment of these translation gains or losses is dependent upon our determination of the functional currency of each subsidiary 
the functional currency is determined based on management s judgment and involves consideration of all relevant economic facts and circumstances affecting the subsidiary 
generally  the currency in which the subsidiary transacts a majority of its transactions  including billings  financing  payroll and other expenditures would be considered the functional currency  but any dependency upon the parent and the nature of the subsidiary s operations must also be considered 
if any subsidiary s functional currency is deemed to be the local currency  then any gain or loss associated with the translation of that subsidiary s financial statements is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
however  if the functional currency is deemed to be the united states dollar or a currency other than the local currency  then any gain or loss associated with the translation of these financial statements would be included within our statement of operations 
if we dispose of any of our subsidiaries  any cumulative translation gains or losses included in accumulated other comprehensive loss would be realized into our statement of operations 
if we determine that there has been a change in the functional currency of a subsidiary from the local currency to the united states dollar  any translation gains or losses arising after the date of change would be included within our statement of operations 
based on our assessment of the factors discussed above  we generally consider the relevant subsidiary s local currency to be the functional currency for our international subsidiaries 
accordingly  we had cumulative translation losses of approximately million and million that were included in accumulated other comprehensive loss within our balance sheet at march  and  respectively 
during fiscal  and  translation adjustments of million  million and million  respectively  were included in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
had we determined that the functional currency of our subsidiaries was the united states dollar or a currency other than the local currency  these losses would have increased our net income loss for each of the years presented 
the magnitude of these gains or losses is dependent upon movements in the exchange rates of the foreign currencies in which we transact business against the united states dollar 
these currencies include the japanese yen  euro  pound sterling and australian and canadian dollars 
any future translation gains or losses could be significantly higher than those noted in each of these years 
in addition  if we determine that a change in the functional currency of one of our subsidiaries has occurred  we would be required to include any translation gains or losses from the date of change in our statement of operations 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenue pursuant to applicable accounting standards  including securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab  as amended  summarizes certain of the sec staff s views in applying generally accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition in financial statements and provides guidance on revenue recognition issues in the absence of authoritative literature addressing a specific arrangement or a specific industry 
our policy is to recognize revenue from sales to customers when the rights and risks of ownership have passed to the customer  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
under specific conditions  we permit our customers to return or exchange products 
the provision for estimated returns is recorded as a reduction of revenue concurrently with the recognition of revenue 
we analyze historical sales returns and analysis of credit memo data when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns allowances in any accounting period 
financial risk management and derivatives the purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect us from the risk that the eventual cash flows resulting from interest payments on our euro denominated debt will be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates 
in addition  we seek to manage the impact of foreign currency fluctuations related to the repayment of intercompany transactions  including intercompany borrowings 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
it is our policy to utilize derivative financial instruments to reduce foreign exchange risks where internal netting strategies cannot be effectively employed 
fluctuations in the value of hedging instruments are offset by fluctuations in the value of the underlying exposures being hedged 
in addition  we use forward exchange contracts to hedge certain purchases and sales commitments and the related payables and receivables  including other third party or intercompany foreign currency transactions 
hedged transactions are denominated primarily in european currencies  australian dollar and japanese yen 
gains and losses due to rate fluctuations on these transactions are recognized in the same period as the items being hedged and are recorded as a foreign currency gain or loss 
cash flows related to these gains and losses are reported as operating or financing activities in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows depending on the nature of the hedged item 
the counterparties to these contracts are substantial and credit worthy multinational commercial banks 
the risks of counterparty nonperformance associated with these contracts are not considered to be significant 
contingent liabilities we establish reserves for estimated loss contingencies when it is management s assessment that a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
revisions to contingent liabilities are reflected in income in the period in which circumstances change or different facts or information become known that affect the previous assumptions with respect to the likelihood or amount of loss 
reserves for contingent liabilities are based upon management s assumptions and estimates  as well as the advice of legal counsel or other third parties regarding the probable outcomes of the matter 
should the outcome differ from the assumptions and estimates  revisions to the estimated reserves for contingent liabilities would be required

our net sales were million in fiscal  reflecting an increase of million or from million in fiscal using constant exchange rates  net sales increased by 
the increase in net sales was primarily in our european and north american regions 
net sales in the european region increased primarily due to growth from our prescription laboratory network in france  italy and spain that was partially offset by weaker results from our wholesale businesses in germany and the uk 
the increase in north america was primarily due to our sales and marketing initiatives  improved product portfolio and increased prescription laboratory presence 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in net sales to the rest of world region 
a net sales increase in south america was offset by sales declines in asia  including japan  and the middle east due largely to current economic and political conditions 
net sales performances by region were as follows north america increased by million or  europe increased by million or  and rest of world decreased by million or 
using constant exchange rates  the regional performances were as follows north america increased by  europe increased by  and rest of world increased by 

table of contents gross profit and gross margin 
our gross profit totaled million for fiscal compared to gross profit of million for fiscal  an increase of million or 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales or gross margin increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase in gross margin for fiscal resulted primarily from improved overhead absorption due to our decision to selectively increase global inventory balances to improve customer service levels and to an increase of higher margin value added sales in north america and europe 
operating expenses 
our operating expenses in fiscal totaled million compared to million for fiscal research and development expenses were million or of net sales in fiscal and were million or of net sales for fiscal the decrease of million or in our research and development expenses was due in part to headcount reductions associated with the transfer of research and development activities from petaluma  california to lonsdale  australia

as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses decreased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal the decrease in general and administrative expenses is the result of lower costs associated with the consolidation of our corporate functions  as well as consolidating our north american commercial activities into one primary location 
net interest expense and foreign currency gain loss 
our net interest expense totaled million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  an increase of million 
the increase was due primarily to the impact of the euro us dollar exchange rates between periods 
in fiscal  we recorded a net foreign exchange loss of million compared to a million net foreign exchange gain for fiscal included in the million foreign exchange loss recorded in fiscal were exchange losses on external and intercompany notes of million 
the exchange losses on external and intercompany notes were due primarily to the weakening of the us dollar to the euro and the impact this had on our euro denominated notes 
provision for income taxes 
our combined state  federal and foreign tax rate was for fiscal compared to for fiscal we have net deferred tax assets less deferred tax liabilities on our balance sheet as of march  of million 
the utilization of these net deferred tax assets less deferred tax liabilities depends upon our ability to generate taxable income in the future 
minority interest 
our minority interest loss totaled million for fiscal compared to minority interest income of million for fiscal  a decrease of million 
the decrease was due primarily to increased income during fiscal from several of our joint venture entities whose results are included in the consolidated statements of operations 
management assessment of operating results 
management believes that fiscal and operating results are best understood when costs associated with non cash currency rate fluctuations are excluded from recorded operating results 
in the following paragraph  we present net income loss as adjusted to exclude the impact of foreign currency gain loss on net long term euro denominated debt  net of tax 
we consider these measures to be useful as they provide a better representation of true operating results because the re measurement into us dollars of the principal amount of our euro denominated debt has no near term impact on our cash flows or our ability to conduct business and can cause reported results to fluctuate significantly from period to period 
however  these measures are not indicators of performance under generally accepted accounting principles and may not be comparable to information reported by other companies 
further  these measures do not replace net income loss as indicators of our operating performance 

table of contents net income loss 
in fiscal  excluding the unrealized translation effect of foreign currency on our net long term euro denominated debt  adjusted net income for fiscal amounted to million compared to million for fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
our net sales were million in fiscal  reflecting a decrease of million or from million in fiscal using constant exchange rates  net sales increased by 
the decrease in net sales was primarily due to reduced sales in the rest of world and north america regions 
net sales in the rest of world region decreased due to our efforts to concentrate on higher margin value added sales 
the decrease in north america was due primarily to decreased sales to laboratory customers that are owned and aligned with two principal competitors 
net sales performances by region were as follows north america decreased by million or  europe increased by million or  and rest of world decreased by million or 
using constant exchange rates  the regional performances were as follows north america decreased by  europe increased by  and rest of world increased by 
gross profit and gross margin 
our gross profit totaled million for fiscal compared to gross profit of million for fiscal  an increase of million or 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales or gross margin increased to for fiscal from for fiscal fiscal gross profit was adversely impacted by lower sales levels while fiscal gross profit included inventory write offs of million 
operating expenses 
our operating expenses in fiscal totaled million compared to million for fiscal operating expenses included special charges of million in fiscal research and development expenses were million or of net sales in fiscal and were million or of net sales for fiscal the decrease of million or in our research and development expenses was due in part to headcount reductions associated with the strategic initiatives 
selling and marketing expenses were million or of net sales in fiscal and were million or of net sales in fiscal the decrease in selling and marketing expenses was primarily due to lower costs as a result of centralizing product management and marketing activities 
our general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal and million in fiscal  a decrease of million or 
as a percentage of net sales  general and administrative expenses decreased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal the decrease in general and administrative expenses was the result of lower costs associated with the consolidation of our corporate functions  as well as consolidating our north american administrative activities into one primary location 
included in general and administrative expenses for fiscal were charges resulting from the devaluation of the brazilian real of million 
included in operating expenses for fiscal was goodwill amortization of million 
due to early adoption of sfas no 
in fiscal  we are no longer required to amortize goodwill as a charge to earnings  however  we are required on an annual basis to review goodwill for potential impairment 
if an impairment is found to exist  a charge will be recorded against earnings 
primarily as a result of our strategic initiatives  which commenced in the third quarter of fiscal  during fiscal  we recorded net pretax special charges comprised of million associated with additional facility closure costs  offset by a gain on the sale of land in north america of million  also associated with facility closures 

table of contents we recorded pretax special charges of million in fiscal we incurred million of expense associated with workforce reductions in north america  europe and australia 
included in the workforce reductions were employees from manufacturing  employees from sales and marketing  employees from administration  and employees from research and development 
at march   million cash had been paid related to workforce reductions incurred since fiscal the special charges included million related to the write off of molds  which were discontinued as a result of our efforts to standardize product specifications on a global basis 
also  we continued to transfer high volume production to low cost manufacturing locations and to consolidate manufacturing expertise into fewer production facilities 
as a result  we incurred special charges of million related to redundant equipment write offs and facility closure costs in fiscal additionally  as a result of our discontinuation of the development of the polycarbonate matrix product line  we incurred million in asset write offs  including equipment million and related commitments million 
we recognized a gain on the sale of land in north america of million associated with facility closures in fiscal also included in special charges is million related to the impairment of goodwill associated with a prior acquisition of a lens manufacturing business

operating expenses in fiscal declined by million from fiscal additionally  unit costs decreased significantly from fiscal net interest expense and foreign currency gain loss 
our net interest expense totaled million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  an increase of million 
the increase was due primarily to increased average borrowing rates and increased borrowing levels in fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal  we recorded a net foreign exchange gain of million compared to a million net foreign exchange loss for fiscal exchange gains on external and intercompany notes of million were recorded in fiscal due primarily to the strengthening of the us dollar to the euro and the weakening of the us dollar to the brazilian real and the impact this had on our euro denominated senior notes and us dollar denominated notes with our brazilian subsidiary 
provision for income taxes 
our combined state  federal and foreign tax rate was approximately for fiscal compared to for fiscal we had net deferred tax assets less deferred tax liabilities on our balance sheet as of march  amounting to approximately million 
the utilization of these net deferred tax assets less deferred tax liabilities depends upon our ability to generate taxable income in the future 
minority interest 
our minority interest income totaled million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  an increase of million 
the increase was due primarily to increased losses during fiscal from several of our joint venture entities whose results are included in the consolidated statements of operations 
extraordinary item 
in june  we purchased million of our senior notes prior to their scheduled maturity in as a result  we recorded an extraordinary gain of million  net of tax of million  resulting from the difference between the carrying value of the notes and the purchase price 
the purchase was funded by our credit facility and resulted in a decline in net borrowings 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our operating activities generated million in cash in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in cash flows from operations in fiscal resulted primarily from improved operating performance in fiscal included in net income for fiscal was an unrealized million foreign currency loss on net long term euro denominated debt and cash reserves net of tax 
cash flow from operations was not impacted by this currency loss since it was non cash in nature and  as a result  has been added back to net income for cash flow reporting purposes 
our inventories as a percentage of annualized net sales for fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal were   and  respectively 
inventories at march  increased million when compared to the previous year end 
this increase was due to our decision to selectively increase global inventory balances to improve customer service levels as well as the impact of exchange rates 
the decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal was a result of the strategic initiatives implemented during fiscal to reduce inventory levels 
accounts receivable as a percentage of annualized net sales for fiscal  fiscal  and fiscal were   and  respectively

partially offsetting these expenditures was million of net proceeds received from the sale of land in petaluma  california 
we anticipate capital expenditures  including molds  of approximately to million in fiscal our net cash used by financing activities amounted to million in fiscal this was primarily comprised of net payments on long term debt 
our net cash provided by financing activities amounted to million in fiscal  primarily as a result of the net impact of our issuance of senior notes  the proceeds of which were primarily used to repay our credit facility 
net cash provided by financing activities amounted to million in fiscal  primarily from borrowings on our credit facilities 
cash outflows in fiscal included million related to a stock buy back under our stock repurchase program 
additionally  in the first quarter of fiscal  we purchased million of our senior notes due for million  resulting in an extraordinary gain of million  net of tax 
on april   we completed the sale of million million at date of sale of senior notes due march  through a private placement to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to rule a and to persons outside of the united states in compliance with regulation s 
the notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of our existing and future unsecured debt 
interest on the notes is payable semi annually on each september and march we may redeem these senior notes in whole or in part  at any time  on or after march   at a redemption price equal to of their principal amount plus a premium declining ratably to par plus accrued and unpaid interest and liquidation damages  if any 
prior to march   we may redeem up to of the original aggregate principal amount of these senior notes with the proceeds of qualified equity offerings at a redemption price of of their principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest and liquidation damages  if any 
the indenture governing the notes contains certain covenants that  among other things  limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness or liens  make investments  sell assets  pay dividends or make other distributions 
in addition to our outstanding senior notes and senior notes  our foreign subsidiaries maintain local credit facilities to provide credit for overdraft  working capital and some fixed asset investment purposes 
as of march   the total borrowing capacity available to our foreign subsidiaries under such local facilities was approximately million  of which million had been utilized 

table of contents on october   we entered into a three year million secured revolving credit facility 
this credit agreement replaced the previous million credit agreement 
the new credit agreement contains a number of covenants substantially similar to the prior credit agreement including  among others  covenants restricting us and our subsidiaries with respect to the incurrence of indebtedness  the creation of liens  the making of certain investments and loans  the payment of dividends  and the ability to enter into certain transactions with affiliates 
in addition  the new credit agreement requires us to maintain certain interest coverage  net worth and leverage ratios and places certain restrictions on capital expenditures 
interest on the new credit agreement is payable at a rate based upon the london interbank offered rate libor plus per annum 
as of march   we were in compliance with all covenants and there were no debt outstanding under this agreement 
in order to continue our operations and meet our significant liquidity requirements  we must achieve profitable operations or obtain additional funds through equity or debt financing  bank financing  and other sources 
we believe that our existing cash balances  foreign credit facilities  internally generated funds and other potential financing alternatives will be sufficient to meet our capital  operating and debt service requirements for at least the next twelve months 
if we are unable to generate adequate cash flow from sales of our products  we may need to seek additional sources of capital 
however  we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we could be required to delay development or commercialization of certain products  or reduce the marketing  customer support  or other resources devoted to product development 
accordingly  our failure to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at march   and the effect these obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years in thousands notes payable long term debt  including capital leases senior notes operating leases total contractual obligations as of march   we had no debt outstanding under our bank credit agreement 
we have issued a million standby letter of credit maturing on april  to guarantee third party debt 
we have recourse provisions that would enable us to recover fixed assets with an estimated net book value of approximately million in the event that the obligor defaults on its payment obligation that is subject to our standby letters of credit 
currency exchange rates as a result of our worldwide operations  currency exchange rate fluctuations tend to affect our results of operations and financial position 
the principal effect of currency exchange rates on our results of operations and financial position is the impact on our euro denominated debt and translation adjustments for subsidiaries where the local currency is the functional currency 
translation adjustments for functional local currencies have been recorded to stockholders equity 
certain countries were determined to be hyperinflationary in fiscal and fiscal as defined under the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
d  determining a highly inflationary economy under fasb statement no 
and eitf issue no 
d  accounting for a change in functional currency and deferred taxes when an economy becomes highly inflationary 
accordingly  the results of our entities located in those countries are being accounted for in accordance with the provisions of these pronouncements 
because a portion of our debt and associated interest is non us dollar denominated  we may hedge against certain currency fluctuations by entering into currency swaps or forward contracts 
as of march   we have several foreign exchange contracts outstanding to hedge portions of our accounts payable and accounts receivable exposure 
during fiscal  we had various contracts in place to hedge the semi annual interest payments on our euro denominated third party debt 
we do not hold derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 

table of contents seasonality our business is somewhat seasonal  with fiscal third quarter results generally weaker than the other three quarters 
fiscal fourth quarter results are generally the strongest 
inflation inflation continues to affect our cost of the goods and services that we use 
the competitive environment in many markets limits our ability to recover higher costs through increased selling prices  and we are subject to price erosion in many of our standard product lines 
we seek to mitigate the adverse effects of inflation through cost containment and productivity and manufacturing process improvements 
for a description of the effects of inflation on our reported revenues and profits and the measures taken by us in response to inflationary conditions  see currency exchange rates above 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in november  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf issue no 
provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
the provisions of eitf issue no

fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin is effective immediately for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  we believe that the adoption of this standard will have no material impact on our financial statements

while it is impossible to identify all relevant factors  factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those estimated by us include  but are not limited to  those factors or conditions described below  as well as changes in the regulation of the spectacle lens industry at either or both of the federal and state levels  competitive pressures in the spectacle lens industry and our response to these factors  and general conditions in the economy and capital markets 

table of contents all subsequent written and oral forward looking statements attributable to sola and persons acting on our behalf are qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained in this section and elsewhere in this report 
risks relating to sola and the industry we operate in the highly competitive spectacle lens industry  and we may not be able to compete effectively with entities with more established operating histories and greater financial resources 
we operate in the highly competitive spectacle lens industry 
we compete primarily on the basis of customer service  quality and breadth of product offerings  innovation and price 
the spectacle lens industry is characterized by price competition  which can be severe in some of our markets  particularly for standard products 
we attempt  to the extent possible  to counter competition on the basis of price by focusing on providing a rapid response to orders  maintaining high fill rates  developing differentiated new products and educating processing laboratories and eyecare practitioners on the benefits of our lenses and coatings 
our competitors may develop products or services that are more effective or less expensive than our products or that could render certain of our products less competitive 
since recently developed products comprise a substantial portion of our sales  our performance and future growth are dependent upon our continuing ability to develop and market new products 
some of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources than we do to fund expansion and research and development 
within a particular market  certain of our competitors may enjoy a home country advantage over foreign competition 
we also face competition from a number of our principal competitors  such as essilor and hoya  that are vertically integrated with processing laboratories to a greater extent than we are 
this integration limits the number of independent processing laboratories to which we can market products 
since their acquisition by essilor and hoya  these laboratories have decreased the purchase of our products 
our sales to essilor and hoya owned laboratories were approximately of net sales in fiscal and in fiscal we are subject to certain risks associated with our foreign operations 
we have manufacturing and distribution sites in three major regions north america including mexico  europe and rest of world comprised primarily of australia  asia and south america 
approximately of our net sales in the fiscal year ended march  were derived from the sale of products outside the united states 
as a result  a significant portion of our sales and operations are subject to the risks inherent in international operations  including developments in the foreign political and economic environment may have an adverse effect on operations in those countries  tax rates in certain foreign countries may exceed those in the united states and foreign earnings may be subject to withholding requirements or the imposition of tariffs  exchange controls or other restrictions  we may find it difficult to manage a large organization spread throughout various countries  including staffing and managing foreign operations  we may have difficulty enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems  foreign customers may have longer payment cycles than customers in the united states  and we may find it difficult to comply with a variety of foreign laws and regulations 
as we continue to expand our business globally  our success will be dependent  in part  on our ability to effectively manage these and other risks 
these and other factors could have a material adverse effect on our international operations or our business as a whole 
our cash flow is comprised of a variety of currencies 
although we may enter into currency swap agreements with financial institutions to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency values relative to our debt obligations  these hedging transactions  if entered into  will not eliminate that risk entirely 
as a result of our worldwide operations  currency exchange rate fluctuations tend to affect our results of operations and financial position 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations currency exchange rates and inflation 

table of contents we may not be able to continually reduce manufacturing costs 
to maintain and or strengthen our competitive position within the spectacle lens industry  we must continually reduce our product manufacturing costs and operating expenses 
in addition to normal cost reduction activities  we have initiated product migration and standardization activities and reduced the number of people employed worldwide 
these reductions were necessary to help offset price decreases  inflationary pressures and changes in product and regional mix 
to the extent our cost reduction activities are unsuccessful  in part or in full  our ability to compete may be significantly impacted 
we concentrate a large part of our manufacturing operations in tijuana  mexico 
currently  approximately of our manufacturing operations are based in three facilities in tijuana  mexico 
a fire  flood  earthquake  war  work stoppage  supply shortage or disruption  adverse government action or other disaster or condition could result in a loss of production capabilities and  accordingly  impede our ability to meet our customers requirements 
the risks of these events are partially mitigated by various efforts  in particular our global specifications standardization program  which increasingly allows access to inventory around the world  and our program to ensure dual or multi manufacturing site production of key products with planned stand by capacity 
we must continue to develop new and enhanced products 
we are continually developing new and enhanced products in an effort to develop incremental sales and improved gross margins 
our ability to develop new and enhanced products successfully will be a significant factor in our ability to grow and remain competitive 
some of our products may become obsolete  and we may not achieve the technological advances necessary for us to remain competitive 
we are also subject to the risks generally associated with new product introductions  such as lack of market acceptance and delays in product development 
our results may be affected by our ability to generate sales from new products as anticipated and the costs of such introductions 
we compete against alternative technologies and treatments that provide a substitute for spectacle lenses 
spectacle lenses compete with other methods of vision correction  including laser surgery and contact lenses 
as these technologies evolve  they may provide more competition to the spectacle lens business and lead to declines in our net sales 
we conduct all of our foreign operations through subsidiaries and the payment of dividends by these entities may be restricted 
we conduct all of our foreign operations through subsidiaries 
these operations contribute significantly to our sales and profitability 
the payment of dividends and the making of loans and advances to us by our subsidiaries are in many instances subject to statutory restrictions  are contingent upon the results of operations of those subsidiaries and are subject to various business considerations 
dividends and other payments to us from subsidiaries in certain jurisdictions are subject to legal restrictions and may have adverse tax consequences to us 
management reviews the need for cash distributions to us from our foreign subsidiaries on a case by case basis 
although it is management s intention that all undistributed earnings of non us subsidiaries be reinvested indefinitely  if the need for cash distributions from the subsidiaries should arise in the future  there can be no assurance that the subsidiaries will be permitted to make such cash distributions without legal restrictions or adverse tax consequences to us 
we are dependent on a small number of suppliers for raw materials 
most of the raw materials used in our products are readily available from a number of suppliers at competitive prices  and we have not experienced any significant shortages in obtaining raw materials 
while there are currently multiple suppliers of polycarbonate and monomer raw materials  we purchase over of those materials from three suppliers 
the loss of any of these suppliers  or a significant decrease in the supply of polycarbonate or monomer  would require us to obtain these raw materials elsewhere 
if we were unable to obtain polycarbonate or monomer from other suppliers at acceptable prices  we might realize lower margins and experience difficulty in meeting our customers requirements 
in addition  our photochromic lenses are processed by a third party using technology that is proprietary to it 

table of contents we are dependent upon the north american chain retail channel 
distribution to national chain retail  super optical retail stores and retail buying groups is a growing distribution channel for spectacle lenses 
we believe this distribution channel will continue to be important to sustain growth and profitability 
while we are currently well positioned in this distribution channel through relationships with key retailers  these relationships could terminate or these retailers could choose one or more of our competitors to provide them with lenses in the future 
additionally  these retailers could choose to process and distribute lenses themselves rather than purchasing the lenses from us or any other third party 
we may be adversely affected by environmental and safety regulations to which we are subject 
we must comply with us and foreign environmental laws and regulations concerning emissions to the air  waste water discharges and the generation  handling  storage  transportation and disposal of hazardous wastes  and with other federal  state and foreign laws and regulations 
we believe that we possess all material permits and licenses necessary for the continuing operation of our business and believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with the terms of all applicable environmental laws 
we cannot assure you that we will operate at all times in complete compliance with all such requirements 
we could be subject to potentially significant fines and penalties for any noncompliance that may occur 
it is impossible to predict accurately what effect these laws and regulations will have on us in the future 
our success depends on our key personnel and we may not be able to retain sufficient qualified personnel 
our success depends in part on our ability to attract personnel with spectacle industry experience 
we may face competition in recruiting this personnel and accordingly experience difficulty in growing and succeeding 
the loss of the services of this personnel or the ability to retain such personnel in the future could hinder the implementation of our business strategy 
we do not carry key man insurance on our senior management team 
our substantial level of indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition 
we have substantial indebtedness that may limit our ability to respond to market conditions including our ability to satisfy capital expenditure requirements or to meet our contractual or financial obligations 
in addition  the debt instruments governing our indebtedness are subject to covenants that could limit our ability to conduct our business 
furthermore  our ability to satisfy our obligations depends on our future performance 
our future performance is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  including factors beyond our control 
interest on our million aggregate principal amount of senior notes and million aggregate principal amount of senior notes is payable in cash semi annually through and including march  the senior notes are both payable in full on march  although we believe that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet all of our debt service requirements and to fund our capital expenditure requirements  we cannot guarantee that this will be the case 
our charter and by laws contain antitakeover provisions that could make the acquisition of sola more difficult 
certain provisions of delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and by laws could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire  control of sola 
for example  our by laws include advance notice procedures for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors as well as to submit proposals for consideration at stockholders meetings 
we have also adopted a shareholder rights plan that could have the effect of delaying or hindering a possible takeover of sola 
in addition  we are subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of sola 

table of contents risks relating to our common stock the public market for our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile 
the market price of our common stock is highly volatile and could fluctuate significantly in response to various factors  including actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results  announcements of new products by us or our competitors  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  trends in our business environment  including competitive and pricing pressures  and general market conditions and other factors 
in addition  the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of equity securities 
these fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance 
these broad market factors may materially affect the trading price of our common stock 
general economic  political and market conditions like recessions and interest rate fluctuations may also have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
our quarterly operating results may vary 
our quarterly operating results have varied in the past  and we expect that our quarterly operating results will continue to vary in future periods depending on a number of factors  including seasonal variances in demand for our products  the cost of product introductions  changes in product mix  our ability to control costs  capital expenditures  working capital requirements and other factors described in this risk factors section of this report 
for example  all other factors aside  our results are generally weakest in the third quarter as a result of lower sales during the holiday season and strongest in the fourth quarter 
for these and other reasons  we may not meet the earnings estimates of securities analysts or investors  and our stock price could suffer 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative disclosures we are exposed to market risks inherent in our operations  primarily related to interest rate risk and currency risk 
these risks arise from transactions and operations entered into in the normal course of business 
interest rate risk 
we are subject to interest rate risk on our existing long term debt and any future financing requirements 
during fiscal  fixed rate debt consisted primarily of outstanding balances on senior notes 
the following table presents the future principal cash flows and weighted average interest rates expected on our existing long term debt instruments 
fair values have been determined based on quoted market prices as of march  expected maturity date as of march  fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fair thereafter total value dollars in thousands long term debt fixed rate debt weighted average interest rate long term debt variable rate debt weighted average interest rate 
table of contents currency rate risk 
we are exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations on our million senior notes  due as well as accounts receivable and accounts payable of our subsidiaries denominated in currencies other than their local currencies 
our subsidiaries primarily operate in foreign markets and predominantly have their local currencies as their functional currencies 
these subsidiaries do not have third party borrowings in currencies other than their local currencies 
accordingly  there are no quantitative disclosures related to borrowings by our subsidiaries 
the following table presents the future principal cash flows and weighted average interest rates expected on the million senior notes  due as well as the contract amount and weighted average settlement price of the outstanding forward exchange contracts 
fair values have been determined based on quoted market prices as of march  expected maturity date as of march  fiscal fiscal total fair value dollars in thousands long term debt fixed rate debt weighted average interest rate forward exchange contracts contract amounts due april contract amounts due may contract amounts due june contract amounts due july contract amounts due august contract amounts due september contract amounts due october contract amounts due november contract amounts due december contract amounts due january contract amount due february contract amount due march weighted average settlement price qualitative disclosures interest rate risk 
our primary interest rate risk exposures relate to our ability to pay or refinance long term borrowings at maturity at market rates  the impact of interest rate movements on our ability to meet interest expense requirements and financial covenants  and the impact of interest rate movements on our ability to obtain adequate financing to fund future operations or business acquisitions 
we manage interest rate risk on our outstanding long term borrowings through the use of fixed rate debt 
while we cannot predict our ability to refinance existing debt  or the impact interest rate movements might have on existing debt  we evaluate our financial position on an ongoing basis 
because the majority of our debt is fixed rate in nature  an increase of in interest rates would not have a material increase in our net income for the next months 

table of contents currency rate risk 
our primary currency rate risk exposures relate to our global operations  whereby approximately of our revenues are derived from operations outside the united states  denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  the ability of our operations to satisfy cash flow requirements of predominantly euro and us dollar denominated long term debt without the need to repatriate earnings and profits  which are denominated in currencies other than the euro and us dollar  our investments in foreign subsidiaries being primarily directly from the us parent  resulting in us dollar investments in foreign currency functional companies  and the location of our operating subsidiaries in a number of countries that have seen significant exchange rate changes against the us dollar  primarily downward in recent years  such as brazil  mexico  venezuela and certain asian countries 
we manage our currency rate risks through a variety of measures 
in certain limited instances  subsidiaries  after obtaining direction and approval from our head office  will enter into forward exchange contracts in connection with inter company purchases and sales of products 
these contracts do not extend longer than one year 
subsidiaries operating in high inflation environments protect margins by methods that include increasing prices monthly at a rate appropriate to cover anticipated inflation  compounding interest charges on sales invoices daily and holding cash balances in us dollar denominated accounts where possible 
we disclose constant exchange rate net sales performances in the aggregate  as well as by region  in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations
