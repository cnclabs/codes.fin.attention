results of operations vs 
financial results our net loss for was  compared with  for  an improvement of  our operating results improved  from a loss of  for to  for as discussed below 
revenues our total revenues for were  which was  higher than in retained royalty settlement revenues of  in were from the sale of  of our potential award in the materna lawsuit discussed below 
excluding this  revenues increased over in   of our revenues were from four technologies  from ethyol tm   from the sale discussed above   from the homocysteine assay  and  from gallium arsenide semiconductors 
ethyol s royalty base is higher since october when the licensee began selling ethyol directly in the united states rather than through a distributor 
our retained royalties from ethyol reached our  per calendar year maximum for calendar in fiscal in the future  we expect to receive and record our total  per calendar year ethyol retained royalties in our third and fourth fiscal quarters 
effective may   ctt sold to lawfinance group  inc a portion of its potential million from the patent infringement judgment against american cyanamid company in the materna tm lawsuit 
ctt received  cash recognized in retained royalty settlement revenue in exchange for the first  plus court awarded interest thereon from may  of ctt s share of the potential award 
ctt has no financial obligation to repay lawfinance or to return any portion of the  received from lawfinance  accordingly  ctt recorded this amount as revenue 
if ctt s share of a final award is less than the amount sold to lawfinance  the entire amount received would be paid to lawfinance and lawfinance would be deemed paid in full 
ctt granted lawfinance a security interest in ctt s share of the potential award 
at july   ctt retains the remaining anticipated approximately  proceeds from this potential award in addition to the  already received 
the increase in homocysteine assay royalties includes amounts for assays performed in several quarters by labcorp  under a stipulated order in the labcorp litigation and other clinical laboratories  under license agreements made in the second quarter of 
labcorp has appealed the judgment in favor of ctt 
if the judgment is reversed on appeal  labcorp s ability to recover amounts paid to ctt will depend on the extent of and reason for the reversal 
ctt s management believes the probability that labcorp will recover such amounts is very unlikely

the exclusive licensee terminated its license for the electrochromic display during the third quarter of fiscal as a result  we recognized  previously deferred revenue on this license and  in license termination fees 
the last vitamin b patent expired in november as a result  our revenues which include final royalty payments under these licenses declined  from our royalties

general and administrative expenses for were  which was  higher than in expenses that increased were corporate legal expenses directly related to the sec investigation increased  see note to consolidated financial statements  financing increased  and investor relations increased 
we had expected to charge  of financing costs incurred since october against the proceeds of a debt or equity financing in we expensed them in the fourth quarter of since the placement memorandum was no longer current and we have not yet obtained funding 
reversal of accounts payable exchanged for contingent note payable on october   the company signed an agreement making future payments to our former patent litigation counsel in the fujitsu matter completely contingent on future receipts from fujitsu 
this contingent promissory note payable is for  plus simple interest at the annual rate of from the agreement date  at july  payable only from future receipts in a settlement or other favorable outcome of the litigation against fujitsu  if any 
accordingly  in the first quarter of  we reversed from accounts payable  that was accrued at july  this one time reversal constituted other operating income in the first quarter of and increased shareholders interest

results of operations vs 
our total revenues for fiscal were  which was  lower than for fiscal for fiscal  retained royalties were  which was  lower than for fiscal in fiscal  approximately  of our retained royalties were from four technologies  from gallium arsenide patents including a laser diode technology used in optoelectronic storage devices and another technology that improves semiconductor operating characteristics   from ethyol a chemotherapeutic mitigation agent   from the vitamin b assay  and  from the homocysteine assay 
retained royalties from the gallium arsenide semiconductor inventions which include laser diode applications for fiscal were approximately  compared with approximately  for fiscal  a decline of approximately   
this reflects lower telecom industry sales partially offset by higher dvd product sales 
most of our royalties from these inventions are reported semi annually in the second and fourth fiscal quarters 
retained royalties were also lower because a licensee which had previously been paying  minimum pre market annual retained royalties in prior fiscal years terminated its license and therefore paid no minimum in fiscal also lower were retained royalties from homocysteine and expiring vitamin b assay patents our last vitamin b assay patent expired in november 
a homocysteine licensee that had been paying certain royalties in fiscal began withholding those royalties in fiscal  taking a position similar to labcorp s position 
retained royalty increases from other technologies partially offset these reductions 
royalties from ethyol in fiscal increased approximately  over fiscal other increases included higher minimum royalties on licenses of our sunless tanning technology and a treatment for sexual dysfunction  one time royalties from a retin a tm royalty audit and earned royalties from a new license in licensees of our endoscopic ligator have withheld royalties since the third quarter of fiscal our retained royalties from the endoscopic ligator were approximately  for fiscal we believe we are entitled to all withheld and future royalties for use of our patented technology 
however  we cannot predict when  if ever  licensees will resume remitting royalties for this technology 
other changes in retained royalty revenues reflect changes in the timing of royalties reported by licensees and in licensees sales of licensed products 
historically  the company s royalty revenues in its second and fourth fiscal quarters have been higher than in its first and third fiscal quarters 
in fiscal we employed people full time equivalents compared with in fiscal we increased our professional staff and reduced consultants compared with fiscal recruiting expenses in fiscal to search for a new president and chief executive officer were higher than those for professional staff hired in fiscal corporate legal expenses were higher due in part to legal expenses related to an sec investigation  see note to consolidated financial statements and increased legal services related to certain contractual matters with a client 
patent enforcement expenses  net of reimbursements  in fiscal were  which was  lower than in fiscal patent enforcement expenses were principally for outside litigation counsels services in the three patent litigations fujitsu  labcorp and materna  two of which were active in fiscal in which our clients and or we have sued to enforce their and our patent rights 
the level of activity in these two cases was lower in fiscal than in fiscal in fiscal we paid a client  as reimbursement of certain of our previously deducted patent enforcement expenses 
we included this charge in patent enforcement expenses in fiscal if and when the related enforcement action is settled  we are entitled to reimbursement of these and additional litigation expenses we have then incurred from any recovery we receive as a result of the litigation and from subsequent income from the related patents 
personnel and other direct expenses relating to revenue were  for  which was  higher than in this increase principally reflects increased costs for salaries and recruiting expenses 
it also includes approximately  of intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal see note to consolidated financial statements 
general and administrative expenses for were  which was  lower than in reductions in acquisition costs  audit and tax fees  directors fees and expenses and depreciation were partially offset by increases in legal expenses directly related to the sec investigation see note to consolidated financial statements

in the third quarter of fiscal  ctt recorded a recovery of  of its secured bridge financing advances to micro asi  inc at july   ctt reduced its carrying value for all its investments and advances to micro asi to zero because of micro asi s bankruptcy filing in august we are unable to predict the timing or amount of ctt s potential future recoveries of our advances to micro asi  if any see note to consolidated financial statements 
interest income of  for fiscal was  lower than in fiscal our average invested balance was approximately lower and our weighted average interest rate was approximately per annum compared with approximately per annum in fiscal other expenses in fiscal were legal expenses incurred in connection with a suit brought against ctt  some of its subsidiaries and directors

financial condition and liquidity at july   the company had no outstanding debt or available credit facility 
effective october   ctt agreed with unilens corp 
usa and unilens vision inc unilens to settle all prior claims  to terminate all prior agreements between them and for unilens to pay ctt an aggregate of  in quarterly installments of the greater of  or an amount equal to of the royalties received by unilens from one licensee 
unilens paid the first  installment on october  installments are due each march  june  september and december beginning december  unilens granted ctt a security interest in all unilens real and personal property that is subordinate to a security interest held by uniinvest holding ag in respect of  plus interest owed by unilens to uniinvest holding ag

uop to unilens corp 
usa 
due to unilens financial condition and the uncertainty of its payments on this obligation  the company will record revenue from continuing operations when payments all of which are in excess of the fair value assigned to the original obligations are received 
the company will also record certain related contingent expenses when incurred 
on august   the district court judge in the materna lawsuit awarded the plaintiffs approximately million plus certain interest from january  the defendant has posted a million bond 
on september   a three judge panel of the us court of appeals for the federal circuit cafc unanimously affirmed the august  judgment 
the defendant has filed an appeal requesting a rehearing or a rehearing en banc before the full bench 
based on the language of the september  judgment  management believes there is a reasonable possibility ctt will receive its share of damages finally awarded  approximately million at july   plus its proportionate share of interest 
however  we cannot predict when these will occur 
we have recorded no potential judgment proceeds in ctt s financial statements to date 
ctt will record revenue for judgment proceeds when it receives them 
we have included details of progress and status in this case in note to consolidated financial statements 
at july   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of  were  lower than cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of  at july  during  the company sold  of short term investments  while cash and cash equivalents increased  to  operating activities used  of cash during  primarily as a result of the net loss  partially offset by collection of  of accounts receivable

the company s net loss for included noncash charges of  comprising  for the impairment loss on our investment in ntru cryptosystems  inc   for depreciation and amortization   for stock compensation and  for impairment of intangible assets 
in addition  the reversal of accounts payable of  exchanged for a contingent note payable was a noncash credit

we are currently exposed to potential indemnification claims in connection with the sec investigation and with complaints filed by certain former employees alleging discriminatory employment practices in violation of section of the corporate and criminal fraud accountability act of see note to consolidated financial statements 
we seek to limit and reduce our potential financial obligations for indemnification by carrying directors and officers liability insurance subject to deductibles 
the company has several agreements with third parties to assist it in licensing specific technologies or to audit licensees royalty reports 
under these agreements  the third parties are compensated only from the new revenues generated by their efforts 
under the terms of one of the company s agreements which the company may terminate on ninety days written notice  it has committed to pay minimum annual license fees of  on each january  beginning january  in addition  the company has agreed to reimburse patent expenses of  as of july  from future royalty receipts before retaining any revenue 
under another agreement  the company has agreed to pay  per technology portfolio when a candidate transferee demonstrates firm interest in two technology portfolios 
ctt and vector vision  inc vvi  a ctt consolidated subsidiary  have contingent obligations to repay up to  and  respectively  three times total grant funds received in consideration of grant funding received in and ctt is obligated to pay at the rate of of its revenues  if any  from transferring rights to inventions supported by the grant funds 
vvi is obligated to pay at rates of of its net sales of supported products or of its revenues from licensing supported products  if any 
these obligations are recognized when any such revenues are recognized 
during fiscal and  respectively  ctt charged and  in related royalty expenses to operations 
ctt s and vvi s remaining contingent obligations were  and  respectively  at july  and  and  respectively  at july  in october  we retained an investment banker to advise and assist the company in obtaining additional debt and or equity funding 
under this retainer as extended july   which either party currently may terminate at any time  the company committed to pay  per month plus out of pocket expenses through january  plus certain fees payable only if ctt completes a financing transaction 
we expensed  of financing costs incurred since october in the fourth quarter of and will expense such costs in the future 
the company will use the net proceeds of any completed financing transaction for working capital and other general corporate purposes including funding ctt s technology commercialization strategy 
we cannot assure you that a financing transaction will be completed 
at july   we had net working capital of  which was  less than at july  our accounts payable at july   included  of invoices we reversed in october  as discussed above under reversal of accounts payable exchanged for contingent note payable 
the company has incurred substantial operating and net losses in the three years ending july  net patent enforcement expenses related to the fujitsu and labcorp litigations have been substantial 
during fiscal  the company has focused its efforts and resources on increasing revenues to replace revenues from expiring licenses  however  these efforts and resources have not yet increased revenues sufficiently 
in addition  the company has incurred  cumulatively through july  for professional advice related to the ongoing sec investigation see note to consolidated financial statements 
the amounts and timing of the company s future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the results of the materna  fujitsu and labcorp lawsuits  the company s marketing efforts  the pending sec investigation and the company s fund raising efforts 
to achieve profitability  the company must successfully license technologies with current and long term revenue streams substantially greater than its operating expenses 
to sustain profitability  the company must continually add such licenses 
the time required to reach profitability is highly uncertain and we cannot assure you that the company will be able to achieve profitability on a sustained basis  if at all 
management has taken certain steps to reduce future cash operating expenses including fourth quarter fiscal staff reductions  to defer payment of certain liabilities  to make payment of certain obligations contingent upon receipt of revenues  and to sell additional portions of its share of the potential materna award 
in addition to seeking debt and or equity funding  we also seek to increase our cash resources by obtaining substantial up front license fees in potential new licenses  by collecting additional amounts we believe are due to us and by selling future royalty streams from our portfolio 
we cannot predict when we might receive our anticipated approximately  potential award which is net of the  sold to lawfinance 
while receipt of that award would satisfy our cash requirements and fund our current level of operations until we believe we could generate revenues to sustain our operations  we cannot rely on it for our current cash requirements 
if we do not obtain sufficient additional cash resources in the next several months  management plans additional cash expense reductions sufficient to sustain the company until it obtains additional cash from revenues  potential litigation awards or other funding sources 
under this plan  the company will implement further cost reductions and cost containment actions to reduce operating costs 
however  royalty revenues  obtaining rights to new technologies  granting licenses  and enforcing intellectual property rights are subject to many factors outside our control or that we cannot currently anticipate 
if these reductions are insufficient or if our efforts do not generate sufficient cash  management would make further necessary reductions that could affect our ability to achieve our growth strategy 
although we cannot assure you that we will be successful in these efforts  management believes that its plan will sustain the company at least into fiscal if the company is unsuccessful at its plans to raise funding as described above  it is unlikely we will continue as a going concern 
accordingly  our auditor s opinion with respect to our financial statements as of and for the year ended july  includes an explanatory paragraph with respect to our ability to continue as a going concern 
at july   ctt s shareholders interest was  under american stock exchange amex listing standards  if ctt has less than  shareholders interest at july   the amex may consider suspending dealings in or de listing ctt s common stock 
we cannot assure you if or when we will again meet amex listing requirements 
the most substantial changes in operating accounts were the  decrease in accounts payable  the  decrease in royalties payable and the  decrease in royalties receivable 
at july   amounts related to labcorp s  under the stipulated order discussed in the results above included  royalties receivable and  royalties payable 
in addition to fluctuations in the amounts of royalties reported  the changes in royalties receivable and payable reflect the company s normal cycle of royalty collections and payments 
other matters the company carries liability insurance  directors and officers liability insurance and casualty insurance for owned or leased tangible assets 
the company is involved in three pending patent enforcement litigation matters 
in addition  the sec is investigating in the matter of trading in the securities of competitive technologies  inc and the company has been notified of complaints filed by certain former employees alleging discriminatory employment practices in violation of section of the corporate and criminal fraud accountability act of all are detailed in note to consolidated financial statements 
the lawsuit described under optical associates  limited partnership oalp in note to consolidated financial statements in our annual report on form k for the year ended july   was dismissed on may  critical accounting policies preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period  and related disclosures 
we base our estimates on the information available at the time and assumptions we believe are reasonable 
we believe that significant estimates  assumptions and judgments affect the following critical accounting policies used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
our audit committee has reviewed their selection  application and disclosure 
revenue recognition we derive revenues primarily from patent and technology license and royalty fees 
since these revenues result from our representation agreements with owners and assignees of intellectual property rights  we record revenues net of the owners and assignees shares of license and royalty fees 
we stipulate the terms of our licensing arrangements in written agreements with the owners  assignees and licensees 
single element arrangements since we usually have no significant obligations after we execute license agreements  they are generally single element arrangements 
under the terms of our license agreements  we generally receive an upfront license fee and a royalty stream based on the licensee s sales of products applying the licensed technology 
license fees under single element arrangements we recognize upfront  nonrefundable license fees when our licensee executes the license agreement and pays the license fee 
when these two events occur  we have persuasive evidence of an arrangement  no continuing obligations  completed delivery  and assurance of collection 
royalty fees under single element arrangements although we fix the royalty rate eg  percentage of sales or rate per unit sold in the license agreement  the amount of earned royalties is contingent upon the amount of licensed product the licensee sells 
royalties earned in each reporting period are contingent on the outcome of events ie  the licensee s sales of licensed products occurring within that period that are not within our control and are not directly tied to our providing services 
therefore  we recognize this royalty revenue when the contingency is resolved and we can estimate the amount of royalty fees earned  which is upon our receipt of the licensee s royalty report 
other arrangements in limited instances  we enter into multiple element arrangements with continuing service obligations 
based upon the limited verifiable objective evidence available  we generally defer all revenue from such multiple element arrangements until we deliver all elements 
we evaluate billing arrangements on a case by case basis 
generally we recognize upfront fees ratably over the entire arrangement and milestone payments as it achieves milestones 
impairment of intangible assets and long term investments we review intangible assets and investments in equity securities that do not have readily determinable fair values for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
if the sum of expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  we recognize an impairment loss measured by the amount the asset s carrying value exceeds its fair value and re evaluate the remaining useful life of the asset 
if a quoted market price is available for the asset or a similar asset  we use it in determining fair value 
if not  we determine fair value as the present value of estimated cash flows based on reasonable and supportable assumptions 
we regularly apply this policy to our equity investments in privately held companies 
we consider the investee s financial health including cash position  business outlook including product stage and viability to continue operations  recent funding activities  and business plan including historical and forecast financial information 
these investments are not readily transferable and our opportunities to liquidate them are limited and subject to many factors beyond our control  including circumstances internal to the investee and broader economic conditions 
we also apply this policy to all acquired intangible assets 
impairment of loans we review loans for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the loan may not be recoverable 
we determine the present value of expected future cash flows under the loan discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
if the fair value of the loan is less than its carrying amount  we recognize an impairment loss based on the fair value of the loan 
this policy is consistent with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan an amendment of statements no 
and recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this statement establishes financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets acquired individually or with a group of other assets but not acquired in a business combination

 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement establishes a single accounting model for the impairment of long lived assets 
the company has recognized impairment charges on investments in fiscal and however  the company s adoption of this statement on august  did not affect the amount or timing of those impairment charges

 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force issue no

the disclosure provisions of this statement were effective for the company s third quarter ended april   the company made these disclosures in note to consolidated financial statements 
related party transactions ctt incurred charges for consulting services including expenses and use taxes provided by one director in fiscal and two directors in fiscal and in the past  the company s board of directors determined that when a director s services were outside the normal duties of a director  the company should compensate the director at the rate of  per day plus expenses which is the same amount it pays a director for attending a one day board meeting 
the company has discontinued this practice
