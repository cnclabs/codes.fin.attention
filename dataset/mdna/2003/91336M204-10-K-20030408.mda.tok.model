item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues revenues for the twelve months ended december  decreased to million from million for the twelve months ended december  substantially all of our revenues consisted of circuit revenues 
the decrease in revenues for the twelve months ended december  compared to the twelve months ended december  were attributable to circuit disconnections and lengthening new business cycles 
the decreases in revenues was partly offset by two non recurring settlement transactions with a customer 
the customer terminated certain circuit and lease contracts with the company  resulting in one time termination revenues of million and million  respectively  in the third quarter of we expect that continued negative trends in the telecommunications industry will continue to adversely affect our revenues 
revenue generated from international operations was not material 
when collectibility of a receivable is not assured in the month service is provided  we recognize the revenues when payment is received  not at the time the services are provided  as described in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
cost of circuit access cost of circuit access for the twelve months ended december  decreased to million compared to million for the twelve months ended december  as a percentage of total revenues  cost of circuit access increased for the twelve months ended december  to from for the twelve months ended december  the decrease in cost of circuit access in absolute dollars in was primarily attributable to a decrease in circuit revenues described above 
the increase in circuit cost as a percentage of total revenues for the twelve months ended december  was primarily attributable to maintaining circuits for bankrupt customers for which no revenue was recognized and increased costs when circuits are disconnected before the end of their term 
these costs from maintaining circuits for bankrupt customers are eventually eliminated as the circuits related to bankrupt customers are disconnected following the termination of service by the customer 
operations and administration excluding stock compensation operations and administration expenses excluding stock plan compensation decreased million to million for the twelve months ended december  from million for the twelve months ended december  this decrease primarily resulted from the restructuring of facilities and personnel 
the number of employees decreased to at december  from at december   and we expect headcount to remain relatively flat for employee compensation and related payroll taxes decreased million to million for the twelve months ended december  from million in the twelve months ended december  similarly  rent for corporate offices and sales offices decreased million to million for the twelve months ended december  from million in the twelve months ended december  due primarily to restructuring and the related charge recorded in the third quarter of the company recorded bad debt expense of million for the twelve months ended december  compared to an expense of million for the twelve months ended december  the decrease in bad debt expense is the result of increased focus by the company on the collections of receivables and the increase in the receipt of security deposits and prepayments for high credit risk customers 
the company performed its annual goodwill impairment test as of june  based on the continuing deterioration and financial condition of the telecommunications industry and the decline in the company s stock price  we determined that the goodwill we recorded in connection with our acquisition of tri quad was impaired 
based on the applicable two step impairment test  we recorded a million impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill to zero 
based on impairment reviews performed at june  and december   the company recognized an aggregate million impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of utx assets  leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures  atm equipment  and a web based pricing  quoting and provisioning software tool project gemini as described in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
during the first quarter of  the company loaned million to sphera under the company s post petition loan agreement with sphera 
in addition  during the three months ended june   the company disbursed additional amounts totaling million to sphera and to a trust account established by the counsel for the official unsecured creditors committee 
based on the net amounts the company believes to be ultimately recoverable under the sphera settlement agreement at december   the company has expensed approximately million of the million disbursed under the loan agreement 
lance boxer  our president and ceo  previously served as ceo of sphera and is a party to the sphera settlement agreement 
as of december   the company no longer has any facilities or employees in europe and all foreign operations have been transferred to our corporate headquarters in chicago 
operations and administration stock plan compensation during fiscal year and the fiscal year of  we granted stock options to employees and non employees with per share exercise prices deemed to be below the fair market value of our common stock at the dates of grant 
these stock option issuances have resulted in stock option plan compensation charges  which are initially deferred and subsequently amortized over the vesting period of the related options 
stock plan compensation expense decreased million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the decrease in stock plan compensation between periods primarily relates to the grant of options with an exercise price below the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant during the third quarter of and the grant of restricted shares to employees in the fourth quarter of there were  and  stock options outstanding at december  and  respectively 
unearned deferred compensation decreased million for the twelve months ended december   of which million was due to the forfeiture of restricted shares of terminated employees

depreciation and amortization depreciation expense includes depreciation of furniture  fixtures  leasehold improvements and equipment at our office facilities and of equipment at our utx facilities 
depreciation expense for the twelve months ended december  increased to million compared to million for the twelve months ended december  the increase in depreciation is primarily attributable to the timing of when utx facilities were placed into service in and capital expenditures related to uix database development 
amortization expense decreased to in the twelve months ended december   compared to the twelve months ended december  stuff software was sold in the third quarter for nominal consideration  and the related unamortized intangible assets of were written off 
restructuring and other nonrecurring charges in the three months ended september   the restructuring charge was reduced for facility exit costs by million due to successful lease negotiations with landlords 
this reduction in restructuring charge was partially offset by an additional restructuring charge of million incurred in the third quarter after a subtenant terminated a rental agreement 
in the three months ended december   restructuring charges of were reversed in relation to favorable negotiation of fees related to lease negotiations for restructured sites 
for additional information regarding our restructuring program see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
other income expense other income for the twelve months ended december  decreased million to compared to million for the twelve months ended december  the decrease in other income was primarily attributable to a reduction in interest income  reflecting lower balances of cash and investments held by the company  and the sale of stuff software for a loss of in the third quarter of income taxes from our inception through september   we elected to be treated as a subchapter s corporation for income tax purposes 
on september   we converted to a c corporation 
at december   we had approximately million of federal and state net operating loss carry forwards 
these carry forwards may be available to offset future taxable income 
our federal and state net operating loss carry forwards expire at various dates beginning in due to the uncertainty that we will generate future earnings sufficient to enable us to realize the benefit of these net operating loss carry forwards  we have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our deferred tax asset 
as a result  no income tax benefit has been recorded in our statement of operations 
we assess our deferred tax asset on an ongoing basis and adjust the valuation allowance based on this assessment 
additionally  section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  imposes annual limitations on the use of net operating loss carry forwards if there is a change in ownership  as defined  within any three year period 
the utilization of certain net operating loss carry forwards may be limited due to our capital stock transactions 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  substantially all of our revenues consisted of circuit access revenues in each of these years 
the increase in revenues was attributable to an increase in the volume of circuits sold  some of which were higher capacity and  therefore  generated greater revenues per circuit 
in addition  there was an increase in the number of clients and additional sales to existing clients 
the telecommunications industry experienced significant contraction and restructuring during and into as a result  there has been a significant increase in the number of bankruptcies among telecommunications service providers  carriers  isps and application service providers  or asps  and this trend may continue 
revenue generated from international operations was not material 
cost of circuit access cost of circuit access increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of total revenues  cost of circuit access decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in cost of circuit access was primarily attributable to an increase in the volume of circuits sold to both an increased number of clients and additional sales to existing clients 
the decrease in cost of circuit access as a percentage of total revenue was primarily attributable to volume pricing efficiencies created by the scaling of our model 
operations and administration excluding stock compensation operations and administration expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was in proportion with the scaling of the business 
as a percentage of total revenues  operations and administration expenses decreased to for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  we reduced headcount to at december  as a result of our restructuring plan 
at december  we had full time employees and headcount remained in excess of through june  the cost of uix development personnel as well as non capitalized costs associated with the uix database increased million for the year ended december  as compared to december  facilities costs  including rent and utilities for corporate offices and sales offices increased million for the year ended december  as compared to december  bad debt expense increased million for the year ended december  as compared to december  as a result of several of our significant clients filing for reorganization or liquidation under the bankruptcy laws 
we also recorded an impairment charge of related to the write down of certain assets  including goodwill and fixed assets  from our pcn division 
sales and marketing costs  primarily for tradeshows  advertising and promotions  decreased million for the year ended december  during  we began operations in london and amsterdam to increase our presence in europe 
we incurred a loss from these start up operations of approximately million in as part of our restructuring program in  our office space and employee headcount in london were substantially reduced 
these operations were eliminated in operations and administration stock compensation during fiscal year and the first quarter of  we granted stock options to employees and non employees with per share exercise prices deemed to be below the fair market value of our common stock at the dates of grant 
these stock option issuances have resulted in stock compensation charges  which are initially deferred and subsequently amortized over the vesting period of the related options 
stock compensation expense increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the substantial increase in stock compensation charges between periods is attributable to an million charge for options granted by universal access in september in exchange for cancellation of restricted stock granted to executives in january at per share 
in addition  we recognized an million charge for the restricted stock issued by universal access in exchange for outstanding unexercised employee stock options having an exercise price of at least per share 
a total of million restricted shares were issued under our stock plan in december there were  and  stock options outstanding at december  and  respectively 
please refer to note in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this report for additional information 
depreciation and amortization depreciation expense includes depreciation of furniture  fixtures and equipment at our office facilities and of equipment at our utx facilities 
depreciation expense increased by million in the year ended december   compared to the prior year  as a result of the company starting to depreciate eight additional utx facilities during the quarter ended june   and one utx facility during the quarter ended december   as well as additional equipment purchases for existing utx facilities 
amortization expense  which increased during the year ended december   as compared to the prior year  relates to intangible assets acquired in connection with the purchases of stuff software and tri quad enterprises in november and july  respectively 
restructuring and other nonrecurring charges in the quarter ended december   the company recorded a charge of million for restructuring costs and asset impairments 
this charge was reduced by million in the quarter ended december  resulting in a net charge of million during the year ended december  based on the strategic direction of the company and the overall state of the telecommunications industry  management made the decision to restructure the company in an effort to remain on target to achieve the company s financial objectives and reduce administrative costs 
the primary aspects of the restructuring plan were a the company reduced the number of employees in all departments and reorganized departments to further enhance productivity  b based on the reduced number of employees and on operational projections  the company exited a variety of office facilities and one utx facility  c due to the reduced number of employees and the amount of space being vacated  the company wrote down fixed assets  such as computer equipment  furniture and fixtures  and leasehold improvements  and d the company wrote off the value of the investment it had made in a privately held company based on the fact that this company commenced liquidation proceedings during the third quarter 
the workforce reduction affected approximately employees or of june  worldwide employees 
the million restructuring charge reversal in the fourth quarter was primarily a result of the favorable outcome of lease negotiations with a landlord 
for additional information regarding our restructuring program see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
other income expense other income totaled million and million for the years ended december  and the decrease in other income was attributable to our lower cash and short term investment balances and decreases in interest rates 
we invested substantially all of the proceeds from our public stock offering during in cash equivalents with original maturities of less than three months and marketable securities with original maturities of three to twelve months 
interest income for the years ended december  was partially offset by interest expense on notes payable and capital lease obligations 
income taxes from our inception through september   we elected to be treated as a subchapter s corporation for income tax purposes 
in september  we converted to a c corporation 
at december   we had approximately million of federal and state net operating loss carryforwards 
these carryforwards may be available to offset future taxable income 
our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards expire at various dates beginning in due to the uncertainty that we will generate future earnings sufficient to enable us to realize the benefit of these net operating loss carryforwards  we have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our deferred tax asset 
as a result  no income tax benefit has been recorded in our statement of operations 
we assess the realizability of our deferred tax asset on an ongoing basis and adjust the valuation allowance based on this assessment 
additionally  section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  imposes annual limitations on the use of net operating loss carryforwards if there is a change in ownership  as defined  within any three year period 
the utilization of certain net operating loss carryforwards may be limited due to our capital stock transactions 
liquidity and capital resources our consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming we will continue as a going concern 
however  the company has determined that it is necessary to raise capital from external sources in order to both fund operations and to enhance our existing it tools to help the company achieve its sales objectives 
accordingly  the company is aggressively pursuing both debt and equity capital raising opportunities to provide sufficient funds to accomplish these goals 
please refer to note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
effective april   the company obtained million in secured debt financing from citynet telecommunications  inc citynet 
the financing is evidenced by a promissory note the note and secured by substantially all of the company s assets 
under the terms of the note  the unpaid principal balance accrues interest at a rate of per annum  compounded quarterly  and the entire unpaid principal balance and accrued but unpaid interest is payable on april  unless otherwise accelerated under the note 
additionally  effective april   the company entered into a definitive stock purchase agreement the purchase agreement with citynet whereby citynet will invest million in cash and transfer two fiber optic rings having a value of to the company in exchange for approximately of the company s outstanding common stock on a fully diluted basis excluding those options and warrants outstanding at the closing of the purchase agreement having an exercise price above and the company s assumption of certain liabilities of citynet 
after paying expenses related to the transaction  the company estimates that the net proceeds from the purchase agreement will be approximately million 
pursuant to the note  the unpaid principal balance and accrued but unpaid interest will be repaid in full by applying and offsetting the cumulative amounts due under the note against the consideration payable to the company when the purchase agreement closes 
the company expects the purchase agreement to close by july  based on our receipt of million from the secured debt financing and assuming we close the purchase agreement  our operational cash receipts remain stable  we achieve our sales objectives and we continue to control uses of cash  we estimate that we will have sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet our short term liquidity needs 
in addition  we estimate that this debt and equity capital raising will be sufficient to fund our operations until we become cash flow positive and we can accomplish our long term liquidity goal to fund our business with internally generated cash 
however  successfully closing the purchase agreement may be difficult for us  and even if we are able to raise additional capital  our operational and financial flexibility may be limited 
the purchase agreement will also be dilutive to our existing stockholders 
further  unexpected events adversely affecting our cash resources  including declines in collections due to client bankruptcies or deteriorating industry conditions  bankruptcy preference payment settlements  security deposits requirements  accelerated vendor payment terms  payments required to settle disputes or adversely determined litigation  may create a need for us to obtain more funding from external sources in addition to the current capital raising activities described above 
our net financial position cash and cash equivalents and short term investments net of term loans and capital lease obligations has declined from million as of december  to million as of december  we continue to focus on minimizing our cash burn rate and preserving cash and cash equivalents and have reduced the rate at which we use cash 
we have accomplished this over the twelve months ending december   by implementing a series of expense reduction and cash conservation initiatives that have resulted in a reduction in total headcount by employees for a monthly savings of approximately million  completing negotiations with certain of our landlords to reduce our future lease obligations by approximately per month in exchange for consideration including the release of funds under letters of credit  reducing our capital spending due to the completion of construction of our utx facilities and postponement of expansion of those facilities  and eliminating various carrier financial obligations totaling in monthly and million in non recurring charges 
additionally  in march  the company reached a settlement with a supplier whereby the company was able to eliminate a remaining aggregate minimum purchase commitment of approximately million 
as part of the settlement  universal access paid a total of million  including a million prepayment for private line services and to satisfy outstanding billing disputes 
the following summarizes our adjusted contractual obligations after the march settlement discussed above at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
non cancelable operating leases incl 
restructured facilities non cancelable purchase commitments total thereafter   the company s reductions in cash use were offset by a decrease in revenues for the twelve months ending december  compared to revenues for the twelve months ended december  our principal uses of cash are to fund operating losses  working capital requirements and some limited capital expenditures 
our capital expenditures will be limited to the enhancement of selected elements of our two primary service elements  information and facilities 
for information  we will continue to enhance our it tools to help the company achieve its sales objectives and we will continue to seek out new data resources relating to the provisioning of circuits 
for facilities  we will continue to enhance our utx and metropolitan connectivity facilities so as to create a competitive advantage in terms of service delivery  cost and pricing 
we expect to incur approximately in expenses in the first and second quarter of to complete the build out of our denver utx 
restricted cash was million at december   declining million from a balance of million at december  restricted cash consists of letters of credit issued to real estate landlords  carriers and other vendors 
the decline of million and the decline in monthly operating costs of noted in the second bullet above were due primarily to negotiations completed in with three different landlords 
in september  we completed a lease buyout agreement with the landlord of an office facility 
pursuant to the agreement  a the landlord declared defaults under the lease  which permitted the landlord to draw under previously issued letters of credit totaling million in order to cure these defaults  b our obligations under the lease terminated  and c we entered into a new lease for a reduced amount of office space 
as a result of this agreement  our lease obligations were reduced by approximately per month  effective august  and our restricted cash declined by million  the total amount drawn by the landlord under the letters of credit 
the new lease requires us to deliver a letter of credit in the amount of million to secure our obligations under the new lease by october  delivering this letter of credit would reduce our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments  and increase our restricted cash balance  by million 
in september  we agreed with the landlord of another office facility to terminate the lease early in connection with the closing of our office in the united kingdom  which was our last facility outside of the united states 
we did not pay any buyout amounts in connection with this early termination 
the landlord returned to us the letter of credit that had secured our obligations under the lease 
in october  the amount of this letter of credit   was released from restricted cash and moved to cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
in addition  pursuant to a lease buyout agreement negotiated with the landlord of another office facility  a we obtained a letter of credit in the amount of issued to the landlord  b the landlord drew upon the entire amount of this letter of credit  and c our obligations under the lease with the landlord  which were approximately per month  terminated in october in september  our restricted cash decreased by  the amount pledged to the issuing bank as collateral for the letter of credit issued to the landlord 
the landlord agreed to return the letter of and it was returned to us in january in general  our obligations under certain real estate leases  carrier contracts and other business agreements are secured by letters of credit issued to the landlord or applicable vendor 
each of these letters of credit is secured by restricted cash the company has pledged to the bank issuing the letter of credit 
in the past  we have completed negotiations with certain of our landlords to reduce our future lease obligations in exchange for consideration including the release to the landlord of funds under letters of credit 
we expect to continue these types of negotiations in the future 
if these negotiations to reduce our lease obligations are successful  then we expect our restricted cash balance will decline further 
effective march   we completed a negotiation with one of our carriers 
as part of the negotiation and in return for a million prepayment  the carrier released a letter of credit further reducing our restricted cash balance 
cash used by operating activities for the twelve months ended december  was million  compared to million for the twelve months ended december  the increase in cash used by operating activities was due primarily to a decrease in circuit margin offset by a decrease in compensation payments  payroll tax payments and the acquisition of approximately million in security deposits and prepayments in to mitigate potential credit risks 
cash provided by investing activities was million for the twelve months ended december   compared to million of cash used by investing activities for the twelve months ended december  the increase is primarily due to a reduction in the purchase of property  plant  and equipment to support the business and the sale of short term investments used to fund operations 
cash provided by financing activities was million for the twelve months ended december   compared to cash provided by financing activities of million for the twelve months ended december  the increase was primarily due to a draw down of million in restricted cash to complete the lease buyout agreement discussed above 
this increase was partially offset by cash payments of million to retire capital lease obligations 
other matters critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period as well as the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
our management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that it believes are reasonable under the circumstances and re evaluates these estimates and judgments on an on going basis 
reported results may differ from these estimates if different assumptions or conditions were to be made 
management believes that the following critical accounting policies are those that affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements and that an understanding of these policies is important to a proper evaluation of our reported financial results revenue recognition  estimating allowances and accrued liabilities  valuation and useful lives of long lived assets  and restructuring reserves 
revenue recognition we derive substantially all of our revenues from providing ongoing  dedicated circuit access  which includes network management and maintenance services 
circuit charges are billed monthly in advance  and circuit revenues are recognized in the month that service is provided so long as collectibility is reasonably assured 
we begin recognizing revenues from transfer or assignment of circuits once we begin providing all contractual services  including network management and monitoring services 
revenue earned by leasing utx facilities space to a client is recognized ratably on a monthly basis over the term of the lease 
these amounts did not contribute significantly to revenues during the years ended december   or amounts billed for installing a client circuit or installing client utx equipment are billed up front and recognized over the term of the related circuit access agreement 
these amounts did not contribute significantly to revenues during the years ended december   or once we disconnect a circuit and bill any applicable termination charges  we have no future obligations to the client 
we recognize revenue for the full amount of termination charges at the time that the charges are billed  so long as collectibility is reasonably assured 
while the imposition of these charges is provided for in our master service agreements  we have financial exposure in the event that the client defaults on the payment of these termination charges  since we will continue to be liable to the third party carriers from which we have bought network capacity to service such defaulting client 
such an event would result in lower realized margins 
estimating allowances and accrued liabilities we perform routine credit analyses on new and existing clients based on financial statement analysis  cash position and credit risk in order to assess collectibility 
we monitor outstanding receivables on a daily basis and have the right to request security deposits when customers do not pay timely 
in  we collected million in security deposits and prepayments from high credit risk customers 
we recognize bad debt expense for all receivables over days outstanding 
in instances when collectibility is not reasonably assured at the time service is provided  we do not recognize revenue at the time the services are provided  but record amounts billed as accounts receivable and increase the allowance for doubtful accounts 
as of december   we had million in receivables that were recorded directly to the allowance in compared to as of december  we record revenue for these amounts only when cash is ultimately received 
additionally  if events or circumstances occur subsequent to revenue recognition that indicate collection is no longer likely  we record bad debt expense at the time these events or circumstances become known 
during the year ended december   several of our significant clients filed for reorganization or liquidation under the bankruptcy laws 
however  due to increased focus on the collection of receivables and the receipt of customer deposits and prepayments  bad debt expense decreased in to million from million in we continue to evaluate the adequacy of our allowance in light of continuing deterioration of market conditions in the telecommunications industry 
we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  is adequate 
however  actual experience could vary significantly from our estimates  which would adversely impact our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition as would future deterioration in market conditions in our industry or the creditworthiness of our significant clients 
we are a party to legal proceedings with respect to a variety of matters in the ordinary course of business 
the company accrues legal costs that are expected to be incurred to defend universal access relating to certain litigation in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
the accrual is estimated based on management s expectation of foreseeable costs as determined in consultation with outside counsel 
changes in the estimated amount or timing of legal costs can significantly impact the results of operations 
in addition to the allowance for doubtful accounts  the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates of accrued liabilities  including accrued carrier expenses 
these accrued carrier expenses include estimated supplier charges for services provided and estimated disconnection penalties from our suppliers when we disconnect a circuit before the end of the original service term 
we estimate these accrued liabilities based on the supplier contract  the individual circuit service order  the length of time the circuit was installed and the overall supplier relationship 
we believe that amounts accrued at december  are reasonable  however  actual experience could vary significantly from our estimates  which would adversely impact our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
valuation and useful lives of long lived assets utx facilities and equipment  investment in our uix database and office facilities and equipment represent the majority of our long lived assets 
during  we assessed the cash flows directly attributable to all our long lived assets compared to the remaining net book value 
as a result of this assessment  we impaired million for these assets 
for additional information regarding the impairment of long lived assets  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
restructuring reserves in the third quarter ended september   we recorded a restructuring charge 
estimates used to calculate these charges were provided in part by an outside real estate consulting firm and were based upon their estimate of the real estate market at the time of the restructuring 
as leases are disposed of or subleased in the future  actual timing and terms will likely be different  resulting in future adjustments to the restructuring charge 
in the case that we cannot sublease the facilities as expected  we could recognize a significant increase in future restructuring related rent expense 
in the twelve months ended december  and  the initial restructuring charge was reduced by million and million  respectively 
this was due mainly to the successful negotiation of long term leases with landlords 
for additional information regarding the restructuring  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in this report 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas supersedes accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 intangible assets and primarily addresses the financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and was adopted by the company in january  sfas requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will no longer be amortized and must be tested for impairment at least annually 
sfas further requires that intangible assets with finite useful lives be amortized over their useful lives and reviewed periodically for impairment 
the statement requires that transitional goodwill goodwill recorded before the adoption of sfas be tested for impairment within six months of adoption of sfas universal access has accounted for sfas in as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
this statement deals with the costs of closing facilities and removing assets 
sfas requires an entity to record the fair value of a legal liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period it is incurred for which the cost is initially capitalized  and then amortized over the remaining life of the underlying asset 
once the obligation is ultimately settled  any difference between the final cost and the recorded liability is recognized as a gain or loss on disposition 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  at this time  the company does not believe that sfas will have an impact on its future consolidated financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and supersedes fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas also supersedes certain aspects of apb no 
 reporting of operations transactions  with regard to reporting the effects of a disposal of a segment of a business and expected future operating losses from discontinued operations in the period incurred rather than as of the measurement date as required by apb no 

the company has accounted for sfas in as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and supercedes eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
the provisions of sfas are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   with early application encouraged 
the company does not believe the adoption of sfas will have an impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in november  fasb interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others was issued 
the interpretation provides guidance on the guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
we have adopted the disclosure requirements of the interpretation as of december  the accounting guidelines are applicable to guarantees issued after december  and require that liabilities be recorded for the fair value of such guarantees in the balance sheet 
we do not believe the adoption of fin no 
will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
items affecting future results during  we paid a supplier million in exchange for favorable pricing terms and were amortizing this cost over the ten year life of the agreement 
at december   based on an analysis performed by the company  we concluded that we expect to realize the benefits associated with this asset but only over the next years 
as a result  starting in the amortization expense for this asset will be recognized over the remaining years 
the cash flows directly attributable to this asset exceeded the net book value  so no impairment was warranted 
as such  the expense to be recognized in related to this asset will be compared to  which was recognized in the twelve months ended december  during  a number of employees who were granted restricted stock have been terminated whereby their remaining unvested restricted shares were forfeited 
as a result  without further terminations of employees with restricted shares  the stock compensation expense to be recognized in will be approximately million 
this is a decrease of approximately from the stock compensation expense of million recognized in for the restricted stock vestings 
during  the company impaired a number of assets including utx facilities  leasehold improvements  and telecom equipment 
monthly depreciation expense after impairments was approximately in december item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we may invest in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities 
in general  money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
as of december   all of our investments were in cash and cash equivalents 
interest rate sensitivity we maintain our cash equivalents and short term investments primarily in a portfolio comprised of commercial paper  money market funds  and investment grade debt securities 
as of december   all of our investments had maturities of less than six months 
accordingly  we do not believe that our investments have significant exposure to interest rate risk 
exchange rate sensitivity we currently operate primarily in the united states  and substantially all of our revenues and expenses to date have been in us dollars 
accordingly  we have had no material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations
