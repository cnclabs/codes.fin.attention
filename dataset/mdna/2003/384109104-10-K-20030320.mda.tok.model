sales for the lubrication equipment segment were million  up percent from million reported in  primarily due to new equipment installations at sears  wal mart and an order for the australian army 
the gross profit margin of percent for decreased percentage point from the prior year 
this reduction resulted from lower sales of industrial automotive products  product mix that included a greater percentage of sales from home center paint sprayers  lower production levels and the negative impact of exchange rates 
the reduction was partially offset by a million favorable impact from the liquidation of lifo inventory quantities carried at lower costs from prior years 
operating expenses as a percentage of sales for and were percent and percent  respectively

liquidity and capital resources the following table highlights several key measures of asset performance 
in thousands cash and cash equivalents   working capital   current ratio days receivables outstanding inventory turnover financial condition 
at december   the company s capital structure included million of current debt  no long term debt and million of shareholders equity 
the ratio of total debt to total capital was percent at the end of and total debt outstanding increased million for the year as the result of higher short term borrowings by foreign subsidiaries 
at december   the company had various lines of credit totaling million  of which million was unused 
cash balances of million at december   internally generated funds and unused financing sources provide the company with the financial flexibility to meet its liquidity needs  including its capital expenditure plan of approximately million 
during march  the company repurchased million shares of its common stock for million from david a 
koch  a current board member  and former chairman and chief executive officer of the company  his wife  and a family trust and family foundation 
the company used available cash balances to fund the repurchase 
shareholders equity increased million in to million 
the increase was due to current year earnings of million  common stock issued of million and million of tax benefits related to stock option exercises  offset by million of dividends declared  million of shares repurchased and million of other miscellaneous adjustments 
contractual obligations 
as of december   the company is obligated to make cash payments in connection with its long term debt  capital leases  operating leases and purchase obligations in the amounts listed below 
the company has no material off balance sheet debt or other unrecorded obligations other than the items noted in the following table 
in addition to the commitments noted in the following table  the company could be obligated to perform under standby letters of credit totaling million at december  the company has also guaranteed the debt of its subsidiaries for up to million 
the company expects no pension funding requirement for payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases    purchase obligations total    the company is committed to pay suppliers under the terms of open purchase orders issued in the normal course of business 
the company also has commitments with certain suppliers to purchase minimum quantities  and under the terms of certain agreements  the company is committed for certain portions of the supplier s inventory 
the company does not purchase  or commit to purchase  quantities in excess of normal usage or amounts that cannot be used within one year 
the company estimates that the maximum commitment amount under such agreements does not exceed million 
cash flows 
during  million was generated from operating activities  compared to million in and million in the increase in was due to a number of factors  including higher net earnings offset somewhat by increased accounts receivable 
the increase in accounts receivable was primarily due to higher year end contractor equipment and industrial automotive equipment sales versus last year 
cash generated by operations was used to fund million of capital expenditures  million of cash dividends and million of share repurchases 
the remaining cash was invested in highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less which totaled million at december  significant uses of cash in included capital expenditures of million including two plant expansions totaling million  the acquisition of the asm company  inc for million  dividends  share repurchases and the retirement of debt 
pension plans 
the company has noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering substantially all us employees  certain directors and some of the employees of the company s non us subsidiaries 
pension income approximated million and million for the years ended december   and december   respectively and is calculated based on several actuarial assumptions  including an expected long term rate of return on qualified plan assets of percent and an assumed discount rate of percent 
in developing the long term rate of return assumption  management considers several factors  including the asset allocation  the long term historical performance of qualified plan assets  and the input received by actuaries  including their review of asset class return expectations based on broad equity and bond indices 
on a long term historical basis  actual returns on qualified plan assets have exceeded assumed returns 
the company believes that its current assumption of percent is appropriate in light of these factors 
lowering the expected long term rate of return by percent would have increased qualified plan pension expense for by approximately million 
the discount rate that is used to determine future pension obligations is based on a review of long term bonds that receive one of the two highest ratings given by a recognized rating agency 
due to the decline in these rates over the last months the company has lowered its discount rate from percent to percent 
lowering the discount rate and the salary increase assumptions by percent would have increased qualified plan pension expense for by approximately million 
application of critical accounting policies the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america us gaap 
this requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
actual amounts will differ from those estimates 
the company considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
sales returns 
an allowance is established for possible return of products 
the amount of the allowance is an estimate  which is based on historical ratios of returns to sales  the historical average length of time between the sale and the return and other factors 
also  the company s written agreements with distributors typically limit the amount that may be returned 
though management considers these balances adequate and proper  changes in customers behavior versus historical experience or changes in the company s return policies are among the factors that would result in materially different amounts for this item 
warranty claims 
a liability is established for estimated warranty and service claims to be paid in the future that relate to current and prior period sales 
the company estimates warranty costs based on historical warranty claim experience and other factors  including evaluating specific customer warranty issues 
the establishment of reserves requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses relating to warranty issues 
though management considers these balances adequate and proper  changes in the company s warranty policy or a significant change in product defects versus historical averages are among the factors that would result in materially different amounts for this item 
inventory valuation 
the company s inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
reserves for overstock and obsolescence are estimated 
the amount of the reserve is determined based on projected sales information  plans for discontinued products and other factors 
though management considers these balances adequate and proper  changes in sales volumes due to unexpected economic or competitive conditions are among the factors that would result in materially different amounts for this item 
product liability 
the company is self insured for most product liability claims 
third party insurance is carried for what is believed to be the major portion of potential exposures that exceed the company s self insured retentions 
the company has established a liability for potential uninsured claims 
the company employs an actuary to assist in evaluating its potential ultimate exposure for uninsured claims and then considers factors such as known outstanding claims  historical experience  sales trends and other relevant factors in setting the liability 
though management considers these balances adequate and proper  a substantial change in the number and or severity of claims would result in materially different amounts for this item 
income taxes 
in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements  management calculates income taxes 
this includes estimating current tax liability as well as assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and book accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded on the balance sheet 
these assets and liabilities are analyzed regularly and management assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
a valuation allowance is established to the extent that management believes that recovery is not likely 
reserves are also established for potential and ongoing audits of federal  state and international issues 
the company routinely monitors the potential impact of such situations and believes that it is properly reserved 
valuations related to amounts owed and tax rates could be impacted by changes to tax codes  changes in statutory tax rates  the company s future taxable income levels and the results of tax audits 
new accounting standards in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company ceased amortization of goodwill in results of goodwill impairment testing in indicated no impairment 
had sfas no 
been effective at the beginning of  the non amortization provisions would have increased net earnings by  or 
per share and would have had no effect on net earnings 
sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations was issued in and had no effect on the company s financial position or operating results 
sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets was effective for the company at the beginning of this standard provides for a single accounting model to be used for long lived assets to be disposed of  and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
the adoption of sfas no 
had no effect on the company s financial position or operating results 
sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities was issued in and requires costs associated with exit or disposal activities to be recognized when the costs are incurred  rather than at a date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
this new standard will be effective for activities initiated in or later 
the company accounts for its stock option and purchase plans using the intrinsic value method and has adopted the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 
 as amended in by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
no compensation cost has been recognized for the employee stock purchase plan and stock options granted under the various stock incentive plans 
in accordance with sfas no 
 pro forma net earnings and earnings per share are disclosed in note a to the consolidated financial statements  as if the fair value based method had been applied for all periods presented 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company sells and purchases products and services in currencies other than the us dollar 
consequently  the company is subject to profitability risk arising from exchange rate movements 
the company manages foreign currency market risk  from time to time  through the use of a variety of financial and derivative instruments 
the company does not enter into any of these instruments for trading purposes to generate revenue 
rather  the company s objective in managing these risks is to reduce fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company uses forward exchange contracts  options and other hedging activities to hedge the us dollar value resulting from anticipated currency transactions and net monetary asset and liability positions 
at december   the foreign currencies to which the company had the most significant balance sheet exchange rate exposure were the european euro  canadian dollar  japanese yen  british pound  and korean won 
it is not possible to determine the true impact of foreign currency translation changes  however  the direct effect on net sales and net earnings can be estimated 
when compared to results  the weaker us dollar versus foreign currencies helped to increase sales and net earnings 
for the year ended december  the impact of foreign currency translation resulted in an overall increase in net sales and net earnings of million and million  respectively 
when compared to results  the stronger us dollar versus foreign currencies reduced the company s sales and net earnings 
for the year ended december  the impact of foreign currency translation resulted in an overall decrease in net sales and net earnings of million and million  respectively 
when appropriate  the company utilizes interest rate swaps to manage its exposure to fluctuations in earnings due to changes in interest rates on its variable rate debt 
there was no such debt at december  outlook the company does not provide analysts or shareholders with specific targets for net sales or net earnings growth in the upcoming year 
rather  management is committed to achieving its stated financial objectives over a long term time horizon 
the company s financial objectives are net sales growth exceeding percent annually net earnings growth exceeding percent annually return on sales exceeding percent return on assets exceeding percent return on equity exceeding percent the company is expecting higher net sales and net earnings in it anticipates another year of modest growth for the major industrialized countries  where the vast majority of its business activity is conducted 
the company is  however  concerned about a weakening of this economic outlook and the unknown impact of the war on terrorism and possible military conflict in the middle east or the korean peninsula 
in addition to economic growth  the improved sales outlook is dependent upon many factors  including the successful launch of new products  expanding distribution coverage  modest price increases and stable or favorable exchange rates versus the earnings outlook assumes higher sales  continued improvements in manufacturing which minimize normal cost increases  the continued disciplined management of operating expenses and a relatively stable effective income tax rate
