item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations decision to retain vn operations as reported in the company s form k for the nine months ended december   the company in september terminated its previously adopted plan of disposition for its visiting nurse vn operations 
this decision followed a period of extensive analysis and evaluation of numerous alternatives for the business unit 
in the board s judgment  given the significant external and internal changes that have taken place with regard to the future prospects of the vn segment  retaining the vn segment was the best option available to maximize shareholder value 
in the accompanying financial statements  the company  in accordance with applicable accounting rules  terminated the use of discontinued operations accounting treatment for the vn segment 
vn segment results are now reported as an on going part of the continuing operations of the company for all periods presented 
as a result of the decision to retain its vn segment  the company recorded  in the nine months ended december   a one time after tax gain of approximately million  or per diluted share  resulting from the reversal of the remainder of accounting reserves originally recorded at the time discontinued operations accounting treatment was adopted for this segment 
change in fiscal year end also in september  the company changed its fiscal year end from march to december effective december  pursuant to the securities exchange act of  the accompanying financial statements included herein present information for the year ended december   the nine months ended december  and for the year ended march  
to facilitate an understanding of current operating results management s discussion and analysis of financial position and results of operations includes the unaudited year ended december  compared to the audited year ended december  critical accounting policies the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
when more than one accounting principle  or the method of its application  is generally accepted  the company selects the principle or method that is appropriate in the specific circumstances 
application of these accounting principles requires management to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements  giving due regard to materiality 
receivables and revenue recognition revenues are recognized when the related patient services are provided 
receivables and revenues are stated at amounts estimated by management to be their net realizable values 
certain classes of patients rely on a common source of funds to pay the cost of their care  such as the federal medicare program and various state medicaid programs 
medicare program revenues for the years prior to the implementation of the prospective payment system and certain medicaid program revenues are subject to audit and retroactive adjustment by government representatives 
the company believes that any differences between the net revenues recorded and final determination will not materially affect the company s results of operations or financial condition 
however  it is possible such differences could be material 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company evaluates the collectibility of its accounts receivable based on certain factors  such as payor types  historical collection trends and aging categories 
the company calculates its reserve for bad debts based on the length of time that the receivables are past due 
the percentage applied to the receivable balances in the various aging categories is based on historical collection experience 
insurance programs self insurance programs 
the company bears significant risk under its self insured employee health  automobile and workers compensation programs 
the company s self insured health program has an excess loss insurance policy that reimburses the company for covered expenses up to a certain amount of a specific deductible for each covered person and an annual aggregate deductible for all covered claims 
the company s current excess loss insurance policy ends april  based on information provided by its broker and third party administrator  the company expects health insurance costs to increase between to during due to the inflation of medical care costs 
under its automobile and workers compensation self insurance programs  the company bears risk up to  per incident 
the company records estimated liabilities for its health  automobile  and workers compensation self insurance programs based on information provided by the third party plan administrators  historical claims experience  the life cycle of claims  expected costs of claims incurred but not paid  and expected costs to settle unpaid claims 
general and professional liability 
the company is party to various other legal matters arising in the ordinary course of business  including patient care related claims and litigation 
the company carries insurance coverage for this exposure however its deductible per claim increased from  to  effective july  at december   recorded reserves for the general and professional coverage totaled approximately  the company monitors its estimated self insurance liabilities on a quarterly basis 
as facts change  it may become necessary to make adjustments that could be material to the company s results of operations and financial condition 
the company believes that its present insurance coverage is adequate 
however  due to insurance market conditions  the company will face significant cost increases and higher deductibles upon renewal on april  the company is currently contemplating alternatives including potentially accepting additional self insurance risk in lieu of higher premium costs 
impairment of property  equipment and intangible assets the company evaluates its property and equipment and intangible assets on a periodic basis to determine if facts and circumstances suggest that the assets may be impaired or the estimated useful life of the assets may need to be changed 
the company considers internal and external factors of the individual facility or asset  including changes in the regulatory environment  changes in national health care trends  current period cash flow loss combined with a history of cash flow losses and local market developments 
if these factors and the projected undiscounted cash flow of the facility or asset over the asset s remaining life indicate that the carrying value of the asset will not be recovered  the carrying value will be adjusted to its fair value if it is lower 
there were no impairment charges recorded during the year ended december   however  if the projections or management s assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges not previously recorded for its assets 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations sfas and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
these statements established new accounting and reporting standards for business combinations and associated goodwill and intangible assets 
sfas eliminated the pooling of interest method of accounting and amortization of goodwill for business combinations initiated after june  sfas  effective january   requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives can no longer be amortized  but instead must be tested for impairment at least annually 
the company has completed the required initial and annual tests for impairment and concluded that no impairment currently exists 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
this statement supercedes sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions for apb opinion no 
 reporting results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
sfas requires that one accounting model be used for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  whether previously held and used or newly acquired  and it broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions 
the company adopted sfas on january   and there was no effect on the financial position and results of operations of the company during the year ended december  accounting for income taxes as of december   the company has net deferred tax assets of approximately million 
the net deferred tax asset is composed of approximately million of long term deferred tax assets and million of long term deferred tax liabilities 
the company has provided a valuation allowance against certain net deferred tax assets based upon management s estimation of realizability of those assets through future taxable income 
this valuation was based in large part on the company s history of generating operating income or losses in individual tax locales and expectations for the future 
the company s ability to generate the expected amounts of taxable income from future operations is dependent upon general economic conditions  competitive pressures on revenues and margins and legislation and regulation at all levels of government 
management has considered the above factors in reaching its conclusion that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be sufficient to fully utilize the net deferred tax assets net of the valuation allowance as of december  however  there can be no assurances that the company will meet its expectations of future taxable income 
operating segments the company operates in two reportable business segments adult day health services adhs  and visiting nurses vn 
reportable segments have been identified based upon how management has organized the business by services provided to customers and the criteria in sfas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
the company s adhs segment includes the aggregation of its adc in center operations and in home personal care operations  both of which provide predominantly long term health care and custodial services that enable recipients to avoid nursing home admission 
sources of reimbursement  reimbursement rates per day and contribution margins from the company s adc and personal care operations are substantially alike 
the company s vn segment provides skilled medical services in patients homes largely to enable recipients to reduce or avoid periods of hospitalization and or nursing home care 
approximately of the vn segment revenues are generated from the medicare program 
vn medicare revenues are generated on a per episode basis rather than a fee per visit or day of care 
general and administrative expenses incurred at the corporate level have not been allocated to the segments 
the company has operations in alabama  connecticut  florida  indiana  kentucky  maryland  massachusetts  and ohio 
financial information for the company s two operating segments is presented in note to the financial statements 
seasonality the company s adhs segment normally experiences seasonality in its operating results 
specifically  the quarters ended december and march typically generate lower operating income than the quarters ended june and september as the holiday season and winter weather tend to temporarily lower adc in center attendance  particularly in maryland and connecticut 
partially offsetting this  the company s vn segment operations located in southeast and southwest florida normally experience higher admissions during the march quarter than in the other quarters due to seasonal population fluctuations

the decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities resulted primarily from a lower liability under the self insured employee health program 
this lower liability resulted from a an intentional acceleration of the claims payment process and b lower employee participation due to an increase in required employee contributions 
net cash used in investing activities resulted principally from amounts invested in the acquisition of medlink ohio  improvements in information systems and adult day health services expansion activities 
net cash used by financing activities resulted primarily from borrowings on the company s credit facility  payment of capital lease and debt obligations  repurchases of common stock  and proceeds from stock option exercises

the second trial took place in february  however  no ruling has been issued 
estimated costs of litigation are included in accrued liabilities on the accompanying balance sheet 
the company can give no assurance that it will be successful in its defense 
accordingly  the company is unable to predict what impact  if any  the ultimate resolution of this matter may have on its financial position or results of operations 
medicaid dependence 
the company has a significant dependence on state medicaid reimbursement programs 
for the year ended december   approximately      and of the company s revenues were generated from medicaid reimbursement programs in the states of kentucky  maryland  connecticut  ohio  massachusetts  florida and indiana  respectively 
the company could also be materially impacted by unfavorable changes in reimbursement programs in these states 
in march  the commonwealth of kentucky passed a new budget 
this budget is intended to constrain medicaid spending and kentucky s medicaid program is currently formulating new regulations to implement the budget

there can be no assurance that these changes will not have a material adverse effect on the company 
health care reform the health care industry has experienced  and is expected to continue to experience  extensive and dynamic change 
in addition to economic forces and regulatory influences  continuing political debate is subjecting the health care industry to significant reform 
health care reforms have been enacted as discussed elsewhere in this document 
proposals for additional changes are continuously formulated by departments of the federal government  congress  and state legislatures 
government officials can be expected to continue to review and assess alternative health care delivery systems and payment methodologies 
changes in the law or new interpretations of existing laws may have a dramatic effect on the definition of permissible or impermissible activities  the relative cost of doing business  and the methods and amounts of payments for medical care by both governmental and other payors 
legislative changes to balance the budget and slow the annual rate of growth of expenditures are expected to continue 
such future changes may further impact reimbursement 
there can be no assurance that future legislation or regulatory changes will not have a material adverse effect on the operations of the company 
federal and state legislative proposals continue to be introduced that would impose more limitations on payments to providers of health care services such as the company 
many states have enacted  or are considering enacting  measures that are designed to reduce their medicaid expenditures 
the company cannot predict what additional government regulations may be enacted in the future affecting its business or how existing or future laws and regulations might be interpreted  or whether the company will be able to comply with such laws and regulations in its existing or future markets

health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa was enacted by the federal government on august   and requires organizations to adhere to certain standards to protect data integrity  confidentiality and availability 
hipaa also mandates  among other things  that the department of health and human services adopt standards for the exchange of electronic health information in an effort to encourage overall administrative simplification and enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the health care industry 
the department of health and human services must adopt standards for the following o electronic transactions and code sets  o unique identifiers for providers  employers  health plans and individuals  o security and electronic signatures  o privacy  and o enforcement 
although hipaa was intended ultimately to reduce administrative expenses and burdens faced within the health care industry  the company believes the law will initially bring about significant and  in some cases  costly changes 
the department of health and human services has released two rules to date mandating the use of new standards with respect to certain health care transactions and health information 
the first rule establishes uniform standards for common health care transactions  including o health care claims information  o plan eligibility  referral certification and authorization  o claims status  o plan enrollment and disenrollment  o payment and remittance advice  o plan premium payments  and o coordination of benefits 
second  the department of health and human services has released standards relating to the privacy of individually identifiable health information
