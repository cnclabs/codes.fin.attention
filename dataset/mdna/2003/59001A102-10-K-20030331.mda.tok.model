item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
critical accounting policies we have established various accounting policies which govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in the preparation and presentation of our consolidated financial statements 
our significant policies are described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments  assumptions and estimates by management that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  and revenues and costs which we consider to be critical accounting policies 
the judgments  assumptions and estimates we use are based on historical experience  knowledge of the accounts and other factors which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  and we evaluate our judgments and assumptions on an on going basis 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions we have made  actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates  which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of our operations 
the accounting policies that we deem most critical to us  and involve the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  include our estimates of costs to complete our individual projects  the ultimate recoverability or impairment of these costs  goodwill impairment  the likelihood of closing lots held under option or contract and the ability to estimate expenses and accruals  including legal and warranty reserves 
should we under or over estimate costs to complete individual projects  gross margins in a particular period could be misstated and the ultimate recoverability of costs related to a project from home sales may be uncertain 
furthermore  non refundable deposits paid for land options or contracts may have no economic value to us if we do not ultimately purchase the land 
our inability to accurately estimate expenses  accruals  or an impairment of real estate or goodwill could result in charges  or income  in future periods  which relate to activities or transactions in a preceding period 
we acquired hancock communities hancock  a homebuilder in the phoenix  arizona metropolitan area  effective may   hammonds homes  a builder in houston  austin and dallas  texas  effective july   and perma bilt homes  which builds in the las vegas  nevada area  effective october  the results presented below include the operations of these three acquisitions since their dates of purchase and are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected in the future 
home sales revenue  sales contracts and net sales backlog the tables provided below show operating and financial data regarding our homebuilding activities dollars in thousands 
years ended december  home sales revenue total dollars    homes closed    average sales price texas dollars    homes closed    average sales price arizona dollars    homes closed   average sales price california dollars    homes closed average sales price nevada dollars  homes closed average sales price sales contracts total dollars    homes ordered    average sales price texas dollars    homes ordered    average sales price arizona dollars    homes ordered   average sales price california dollars    homes ordered average sales price nevada dollars  homes ordered average sales price years ended december  net sales backlog total dollars    homes in backlog    average sales price texas dollars    homes in backlog  average sales price arizona dollars    homes in backlog average sales price california dollars    homes in backlog average sales price nevada dollars  homes in backlog average sales price year ended december  compared to year ended december  home sales revenue 
the increases in total home sales revenue in compared to resulted mainly from a increase in the number of homes closed and an increase in our average sales price from  in to  in the number of closings increased as a result of continued growth in our mid priced communities in arizona and growth from the acquisitions of hammonds and perma bilt 
the number of homes closed in texas during included hammonds closings 
the increases were offset to some degree by decreases in closings in our austin division due to an overall weaker economy in that market and in monterey phoenix because of a slowing in demand for our luxury priced homes 
sales contracts 
sales contracts for any period represent the aggregate sales price of all homes ordered by customers  net of cancellations 
we do not include sales contingent upon the sale of a customer s existing home as a sales contract until the contingency is removed 
contributing to the increase in sales contracts for the year from the previous year were the addition of the hammonds and perma bilt operations along with strong markets in the number of new orders in texas during includes orders from our hammonds operations 
as a whole  we benefited from positive demographic factors  historically high home ownership rates  relatively low mortgage interest rates and generally low unemployment figures 
we saw declines in new orders in our monterey phoenix and austin divisions in  which we believe is due to a slowing in demand for luxury homes in phoenix and a weaker local economy in austin 
historically  we have experienced a cancellation rate of approximately of gross sales  which we believe is consistent with industry norms 
net sales backlog 
backlog represents net sales contracts that have not closed 
total dollar backlog at december  increased over the amount due to a increase in the number of homes in backlog and an increase in the average sales prices of those homes 
the increase in the number of homes resulted mainly from our acquisitions  which contributed homes with a sales value of approximately million to our december  backlog 
backlog in our monterey phoenix and austin divisions decreased in due to a slowing in demand for luxury homes in phoenix and a weaker local economy in austin 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  home sales revenue 
the increases in total home sales revenue and the number of homes closed in compared to resulted mainly from the strong market activity at the time the orders for these closings were taken in some of our divisions  continued growth in our mid priced communities in arizona and the may addition of hancock to our phoenix operations 
these increases were somewhat offset by decreases in closings in our monterey phoenix and austin divisions in  due to weaker demand in the luxury price segment and a weaker local economy  respectively 
hancock contributed closings with a sales value of approximately million to our results 
the decreases in average home sales prices in arizona for the year reflect a change in our product mix  as we are now selling more first time and first and second time move up homes than in  due in large part to the hancock acquisition 
sales contracts 
as a whole  we benefited from low mortgage interest rates  generally low employment figures and improved home affordability in contributing to the increase in sales contracts for the year from the previous year were new contracts from the hancock acquisition along with strong markets early in the year 
as a whole  we benefited from low mortgage interest rates  generally low unemployment figures and improved home affordability early in we saw declines in new orders in our monterey phoenix  northern california and austin divisions in  and believe this is due to a slowing in demand for luxury homes and weaker local economies in the northern california and austin markets 
net sales backlog 
total dollar backlog at december  increased over the amount due to a increase in the number of homes in backlog from increased home sales over last year and increased sales prices in some of our markets 
the increase in the number of homes resulted mainly from our hancock acquisition  which contributed homes with a sales value of approximately million to our december   backlog 
backlog in our monterey phoenix  northern california and austin divisions decreased in due to a slowing in demand for higher priced homes and weaker local economies in the northern california and austin markets 
other operating information years ended december  home sales gross profit in thousands dollars    percent of home sales revenue commissions and other sales costs dollars    percent of home sales revenue general and administrative expenses dollars    percent of total revenue income taxes dollars    percent of earnings before income taxes and extraordinary items year ended december  compared to year ended december  home sales gross profit 
home sales gross profit represents home sales revenue less cost of home sales 
cost of home sales include developed lot costs  direct home construction costs  an allocation of common community costs such as model complex costs and architectural  legal and zoning costs  interest  sales tax  warranty  construction overhead and closing costs 
the dollar increase in gross profit for the year ended december   is attributable to the increase in home sales revenue for reasons previously described in that section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the gross profit margin on home sales decreased to in  primarily due to the effect of writing up certain assets acquired in conjunction with purchase accounting for the hammonds and perma bilt acquisitions 
this effectively increased cost of sales by million in the current year  due to the lower gross profit margins generally achieved by hammonds in comparison to the company as a whole and to increased competitive pressures in some of our markets 
land sales 
the sale of land is not a significant component of our business plan  and takes place infrequently 
during  we sold three parcels of land in arizona at a price of million  resulting in a gross profit of  during  land sales of million provided gross profit of  and resulted from the sales of lots in texas and arizona 
commissions and other sales costs 
commissions and other sales costs  such as advertising and sales office expenses  were approximately million  or of home sales revenue in  as compared to approximately million  or of home sales revenue in the increase in these expenses as a percentage of home sales revenue reflects marketing costs in some of our communities that were not yet closing homes in other income 
other income consists primarily of mortgage company income  forfeiture of customer deposits  management fees and rebates made under volume based purchasing programs 
the increase in other income from the year ended december  to the year ended december  is primarily due to increased volume in all of our divisions  resulting in additional income  fees and forfeitures of approximately million 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were approximately million  or of total revenue in  as compared to approximately million  or of total revenue in the lower expense as a percentage of total revenue in in comparison to resulted partly from the june end to the california earn out payment per the terms of the purchase contract when we acquired the division 
the earn out was based on of the pre tax earnings of the northern california region after reduction for a capital charge 
company wide  we were also able to benefit from expanding revenue while holding down increases in overhead costs 
income taxes 
the increase in income taxes to million for the year ended december   from million in the prior year resulted from an increase in pre tax income 
the tax benefit associated with the exercise of employee stock options reduced taxes currently payable by approximately million for the year ended december   which resulted in a more favorable tax rate 
the tax benefit was credited to additional paid in capital 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  home sales gross profit 
the dollar increase in gross profit for the year ended december   was attributable to the increase in home sales revenue for reasons previously described in that section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
home sales gross margins expanded to due in part to the strong housing demand in late and early  which is the period when many of the purchase contracts for homes closed in were entered into with our customers 
we were also able to benefit from a reasonably favorable market for home construction materials  which resulted in lower construction cost increases than had incurred in prior years 
commissions and other sales costs 
commissions and other sales costs were approximately million  or of home sales revenue in  as compared to approximately million  or of home sales revenue in the slight decrease in these expenses as a percentage of home sales revenue reflected greater efficiencies in controlling costs 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were approximately million  or of total revenue in  as compared to approximately million  or of total revenue in the higher expense as a percentage of total revenue in in comparison to resulted from an increase in insurance costs and the increased overhead related to our hancock acquisition 
in addition  the increase in the number of closings in our northern california region in resulted in a greater earn out payment per the terms of the purchase contract 
the earn out was calculated based on of the pre tax earnings of the northern california region after reduction for a capital charge 
income taxes 
the increase in income taxes to million for the year ended december   from million in the prior year resulted from an increase in pre tax income 
the tax benefit associated with the exercise of employee stock options reduced taxes payable by approximately million for the year ended december   which resulted in a more favorable tax rate 
the tax benefit was credited to additional paid in capital 
liquidity and capital resources our principal uses of capital for the year ended december  were operating expenses  land purchases  lot development  home construction  the repurchase of common stock  and the acquisition of hammonds and perma bilt 
we used a combination of borrowings and funds generated by operations to meet our short term working capital requirements and in june we completed an equity offering  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million  in order to meet long term capital requirements 
cash flows for each of our communities depends on the status of the development cycle  and can differ substantially from reported earnings 
early stages of development or expansion require significant cash outlays for land acquisitions  plat and other approvals  and construction of model homes  roads  utilities  general landscaping and other amenities 
because these costs are capitalized  income reported for financial statement purposes during those early stages may significantly exceed cash flow 
later cash flows may significantly exceed earnings reported for financial statement purposes  as cost of sales includes charges for substantial amounts of previously expended costs 
in december we entered into a credit agreement which provides for a million senior unsecured revolving credit facility with a million letter of credit sublimit 
guaranty bank is the administrative agent for the facility  which matures on december   subject to extension provisions 
the new senior unsecured credit facility replaced our two secured credit facilities totaling million  of which approximately million was outstanding when they were repaid on december  these credit agreements were repaid with the initial loan proceeds of the unsecured facility 
at december   million of borrowings were outstanding under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility with unborrowed availability under the bank credit facility of approximately million 
this credit facility contains certain financial and other covenants  including requiring the maintenance of tangible net worth  requiring the maintenance of a minimum interest coverage ratio  establishing a maximum permitted total leverage ratio  imposing limitations on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens  imposing restrictions on investments  dividends and certain other payments  imposing restrictions on sale and leaseback transactions and the incurrence of off balance sheet liabilities  and imposing limitations on the maximum net book value of specified land holdings as a percentage of consolidated tangible net worth 
as of and for the year ended december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
in may  we issued million in principal amount of senior notes due june  approximately million of this offering was used to complete the acquisition of hancock  approximately million was used to pay down existing bank debt  approximately million was used to pay costs related to the senior notes offering and approximately million was used to repay previously existing senior notes 
this early repayment of debt resulted in prepayment fees of approximately  which  net of the related income tax benefit  resulted in an extraordinary loss of approximately  in the second quarter of in september  we purchased and retired million in principal amount of our outstanding senior notes 
the purchases were made at of par at a gain of approximately  which net of related income tax effect of  resulted in an extraordinary gain of  in february  we completed an add on offering of million in aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due june   the proceeds of which were used to pay down our senior unsecured credit facility 
the notes were issued at a price of of their face amount to yield  and together with the may offering  constitute a single series of notes 
our senior notes require us to comply with a number of covenants that restrict certain transactions  including limitations on additional indebtedness  limitations on the payment of dividends  redemption of equity interests and certain investments  maintenance of a minimum level of consolidated tangible net worth  limitations on liens securing certain obligations  and limitations on the sale of assets  mergers and consolidations and transactions with affiliates 
as of and for the year ended december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
we believe that our current borrowing capacity  cash on hand at december   and anticipated net cash flows are and will be sufficient to meet liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
there is no assurance  however  that future cash flows will be sufficient to meet future capital needs 
the amount and types of indebtedness that we incur may be limited by the terms of the indenture governing our senior notes and by the terms of the credit agreement governing our senior unsecured credit facility 
in may  we announced a stock repurchase program in which our board of directors approved the buyback of up to million of our outstanding common stock  and in july this amount was increased to million 
in august  we announced a second stock repurchase program in which the board of directors approved the buyback of up to million of our outstanding stock 
in  we repurchased  shares of our common stock at an average price of per share 
under both programs  we had repurchased  shares for an aggregate price of approximately million as of december  contractual obligations the following summarizes our contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands payments due by period less than total year years years after years senior notes   revolving construction facilities   other borrowing obligations   operating lease obligations    recourse option obligations    total     we do not engage in commodity trading or other similar activities 
we had no derivative financial instruments at december  or as a part of our model home construction activities  we enter into lease transactions with third parties 
the total cost  including land  and construction costs of model homes leased by us under these lease agreements is million  all of which is excluded from our balance sheet as of december  our rent obligations under these leases are included in the table above within operating lease obligations 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information regarding our contractual obligations 
letter of credit and bond obligations we obtain letters of credit  mainly in lieu of cash deposits to support our option agreements  and performance  maintenance  and other bonds in support of our related obligations with respect to the development of our projects 
the amount of these obligations outstanding at any time varies in accordance with pending development activities 
in the event the letters of credit or bonds are drawn upon  we would be obligated to reimburse the issuer of the letter of credit or bond 
at december   we had approximately million in outstanding letters of credit and million in performance bonds for such purposes 
we do not believe it is probable that any of these letters of credit or bonds will be drawn upon 
consolidated cash flow our cash and cash equivalents at december  increased by million from the balance at the end of the prior year 
this increase reflects a net usage of cash in operating activities of million and investing activities of million  offset by increases resulting from financing activities of million 
our main uses of cash for investing activities were for our acquisitions of hammonds and perma bilt which totaled million  while our main sources of cash from financing activities were net borrowings under our credit facilities of million and the proceeds from our common stock offering in june of million  which was offset by million of cash used for repurchases of our common stock 
we used cash in operations of million in  compared with million in net cash provided by operating activities in was million 
the decrease in cash used in operations in resulted mainly from the million increase in net earnings 
the change in cash used of million in over million provided in resulted from increases in our real estate  option deposits and homebuilding assets in conjunction with our increased homebuilding operations 
we used cash in investing activities of million in  compared with million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in cash used in over was primarily due to our acquisition of hammonds and perma bilt  which used cash of approximately million 
the increase in cash used in over was primarily due to our acquisition of hancock  which used cash of approximately million 
financing activities generated cash of million in and million in in we used million in cash from financing activities 
the increase in cash provided by financing activities in resulted mainly from the proceeds from the sale of our common stock in a public offering  offset by increased purchases of treasury shares 
the increase in cash generated in over mainly was due to the issuance of our senior notes 
in  we did not engage in any significant capital raising activities other than the borrowing and repayment of our credit facilities and we used million to acquire treasury shares 
seasonality we historically have closed more homes in the second half of the fiscal year than in the first half  due in part to the slightly seasonal nature of the market for our move up and semi custom luxury products 
we expect this seasonal trend to continue  although it may vary as our operations continue to expand 
new accounting standards in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities selected entities with related contractual  ownership  voting or other monetary interests  including certain special purpose entities  and requires certain additional disclosure with respect to these entities 
the provisions of fin are applicable immediately to variable interest entities created after january  a public entity with a variable interest in a variable interest entity created before february   shall apply the provisions of fin to that entity no later than the beginning of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june  we do not expect the requirements of fin to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
this amendment to fasb statement no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of fasb statement no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the provisions of this statement are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods after december  we do not intend to change to the fair value method of accounting 
the required disclosures are included in the stock based compensation section of note to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this document 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this interpretation expands the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees and requires the guarantor to recognize a liability for the fair value of an obligation assumed under a guarantee 
fin clarifies the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  relating to guarantees 
in general  fin applies to contracts or indemnification agreements that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes that are related to an asset  liability  or equity security of the guaranteed party 
certain guarantee contracts are excluded from both the disclosure and recognition requirements of this interpretation  including  among others  guarantees relating to employee compensation  residual value guarantees under capital lease arrangements  commercial letters of credit  loan commitments  subordinated interests in a special purpose entity  and guarantees of a company s own performance 
other guarantees are subject to the disclosure requirements of fin but not to the recognition provisions and include  among others  a guarantee accounted for as a derivative instrument under sfas  a parent s guarantee of debt owed to a third party by its subsidiary or vice versa  and a guarantee which is based on performance  not price 
the disclosure requirements of fin are effective for the company as of december  and require disclosure of the nature of the guarantee  the maximum potential amount of future payments that the guarantor could be required to make under the guarantee  and the current amount of the liability  if any  for the guarantor s obligations under the guarantee 
the recognition requirements of fin are to be applied prospectively to guarantees issued or modified after december  we do no expect the requirements of fin to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
for disclosures required by fin  see note  commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this document 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  that supersedes apb opinion no 
under sfas  goodwill and intangible assts deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized  but are to be reviewed at least annually for impairment  under impairment guidelines established in the statement 
sfas also changes the amortization methodology in intangible assets that are deemed to have finite lives and adds to required disclosures regarding goodwill and intangible assets 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted sfas on january   and our unamortized balance of goodwill as of that date was approximately million 
beginning in  we ceased our amortization of goodwill 
goodwill amoritzation for and was approximately million and million  respectively 
during  under guidelines contained in the statement  management performed an analysis concerning potential impairment of the goodwill carried and determined that no impairment existed 
a subsequent assessment is being performed in the first quarter of  and to date  no impairment has been found to exist 
see note and note to the consolidated financial statements appearing in this document for further discussion of sfas factors that may affect our future results and financial condition future operating results and financial condition depend on our ability to successfully design  develop  construct and sell homes that satisfy dynamic customer demand patterns 
inherent in this process are factors that we must successfully manage to achieve favorable future operating results and financial condition 
these operating and financial factors  along with many other factors  could affect the price of our common stock and notes 
potential risks and uncertainties that could affect future operating results and financial condition could include the factors discussed below 
homebuilding industry factors 
the homebuilding industry is cyclical and is significantly affected by changes in economic and other conditions  such as employment levels  availability of financing  interest rates  and consumer confidence 
these factors can negatively affect the demand for and pricing of our homes 
we are also subject to various risks  many of which are outside our control  including delays in construction schedules  cost overruns  changes in governmental regulations such as no or slow growth initiatives  increases in real estate taxes and other local government fees  and raw materials and labor costs 
we are also subject to the potential for significant variability and fluctuations in the cost and availability of real estate 
write downs of our land inventories could occur if market conditions deteriorate and these write downs could be material in amount 
although historically we have generally developed parcels ranging from to lots  in order to achieve and maintain an adequate inventory of lots  we are beginning to purchase larger parcels  in some cases with a joint venture partner 
write downs may also occur if we purchase land at higher prices during stronger economic periods and the value of that land subsequently declines during slower economic periods 
home warranty factors 
construction defect and home warranty claims are common in the homebuilding industry and can be costly 
while we maintain product liability insurance and generally require our subcontractors and design professionals to indemnify us for liabilities arising from their work  we cannot assure you that these insurance rights and indemnities will be adequate to cover all construction defect and warranty claims for which we may be held liable 
for example  we may be responsible for applicable self insured retentions  which have increased recently  and certain claims may not be covered by insurance or may exceed applicable coverage limits 
increased insurance costs 
recently  lawsuits have been filed against builders asserting claims of personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential dwellings 
some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements 
we believe that we have maintained adequate insurance coverage to insure against these types of claims 
we believe it is possible that in the future insurance carriers may exclude claims from future policies arising from the presence of mold or such coverage may become prohibitively expensive 
if we are unable to obtain adequate insurance coverage  a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations could result if we are exposed to claims arising from the presence of mold in the homes that we sell 
partially as a result of the september  terrorist attacks  the cost of insurance has risen  deductibles or retentions have increased and the availability of insurance has diminished 
significant increase in our cost of insurance coverage or retentions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
fluctuations in operating results 
we historically have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  variability in home sales and net earnings on a quarterly basis 
as a result of such variability  our historical performance may not be a meaningful indicator of future results 
factors that contribute to this variability include timing of home deliveries and land sales  our ability to acquire additional land or options for additional land on acceptable terms  conditions of the real estate market in areas where we operate and of the general economy  the cyclical nature of the homebuilding industry  changes in prevailing interest rates and the availability of mortgage financing  costs and availability of materials and labor  and delays in construction schedules due to strikes  adverse weather  acts of god  reduced subcontractor availability and governmental restrictions 
interest rates and mortgage financing 
in general  housing demand is adversely affected by increases in interest rates and housing costs and the unavailability of mortgage financing 
most of our buyers finance their home purchases through third party lenders providing mortgage financing 
if mortgage interest rates increase and  consequently  the ability of prospective buyers to finance home purchases is adversely affected  home sales  gross margins and cash flow may also be adversely affected and the impact may be significant 
interest rates are currently at historically low levels and  while it is impossible to predict future increases or decreases in market interest rates  we do not expect current rates to remain indefinitely at their current levels 
in addition  homebuilding activities depend upon the availability and costs of mortgage financing for buyers of homes owned by potential customers  as those customers move up buyers often need to sell their residences before they purchase our homes 
any reduction of financing availability could adversely affect home sales 
competition 
the homebuilding industry is highly competitive 
we compete for sales in each of our markets with national  regional and local developers and homebuilders  existing home resales and  to a lesser extent  condominiums and available rental housing 
if we are unable to successfully compete  our financial results and growth could suffer 
some of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources or lower costs than we do 
competition among both small and large residential homebuilders is based on a number of interrelated factors  including location  reputation  amenities  design  quality and price 
competition is expected to continue and become more intense  and there may be new entrants in the markets in which we currently operate and in markets we may enter in the future 
lack of geographic diversification 
we have operations in texas  arizona  northern california and nevada 
our lack of geographic diversification could adversely impact us if the homebuilding business in our current markets should decline  since there may not be a balancing opportunity in a stronger market in other geographic regions 
additional financing  limitations 
the homebuilding industry is capital intensive and requires significant up front expenditures to acquire land and begin development 
accordingly  we incur substantial indebtedness to finance our homebuilding activities 
at december   our debt totaled approximately million 
we may be required to seek additional capital in the form of equity or debt financing from a variety of potential sources  including bank financing and securities offerings 
the level of our indebtedness could have important consequences to our stockholders  including the following our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions or general corporate purposes may be impaired  we must use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness  which will reduce the funds available to use for other purposes such as capital expenditures  we have a higher level of indebtedness than some of our competitors  which may put us at a competitive disadvantage and reduce our flexibility in planning for  or responding to  changing conditions in our industry  including increased competition  and we are more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business 
we expect to obtain the money to pay our expenses and to pay the principal and interest on our indebtedness from cash flow from operations 
our ability to meet our expenses thus depends on our future performance  which will be affected by financial  business  economic and other factors 
we will not be able to control many of these factors  such as economic conditions in the markets where we operate and pressure from competitors 
we cannot be certain that our cash flow will be sufficient to allow us to pay principal and interest on our debt and meet our other obligations 
if we do not have sufficient funds  we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt  sell assets or borrow more money 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do so on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
in addition  the terms of existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from pursuing any of these alternatives 
operating and financial limitations 
the indenture for our senior notes and the agreement for our senior unsecured credit facility impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us 
these restrictions will limit our ability  among other things  to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends or make other distributions  repurchase our stock  make investments  sell assets  enter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends  enter into transactions with affiliates  and consolidate  merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets 
in addition  the indenture for our senior notes requires us to maintain a minimum consolidated tangible net worth and our senior unsecured credit facility requires us to maintain other specified financial ratios 
we cannot assure you that these covenants will not adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or to pursue available business opportunities 
a breach of these covenants or our inability to maintain the required financial ratios could result in a default in respect of the related indebtedness 
if a default occurs  the relevant lenders could elect to declare the indebtedness  together with accrued interest and other fees  to be immediately due and payable 
government regulations  environmental conditions 
regulatory requirements could cause us to incur significant liabilities and costs and could restrict our business activities 
we are subject to local  state and federal statutes and rules regulating certain developmental matters  as well as building and site design 
we are subject to various fees and charges of governmental authorities designed to defray the cost of providing certain governmental services and improvements 
we may be subject to additional costs and delays or may be precluded entirely from building projects because of no growth or slow growth initiatives  building permit ordinances  building moratoriums  or similar government regulations that could be imposed in the future due to health  safety  welfare  or environmental concerns 
we must also obtain licenses  permits and approvals from government agencies to engage in certain activities  the granting or receipt of which are beyond our control 
we are also subject to a variety of local  state and federal statutes  ordinances  rules and regulations concerning the protection of health and the environment 
environmental laws or permit restrictions may result in project delays  may cause substantial compliance and other costs and may prohibit or severely restrict development in certain environmentally sensitive regions or geographic areas 
environmental regulations can also have an adverse impact on the availability and price of certain raw materials such as lumber 
recent acquisitions 
during we acquired hammonds and perma bilt and we cannot assure you that the hammonds and perma bilt businesses will be successfully integrated with our existing business  the market and financial synergies we anticipate will be achieved in our expected time frame  or at all  the acquisitions will be accretive to earnings due to unexpected expenses  contingencies or liabilities  or due to the financial performance of the hammonds and perma bilt businesses  the combined companies will not lose key employees  management  suppliers or subcontractors  and we can successfully manage new housing lines that were previously managed by hammonds and perma bilt or new lines planned for the future 
future expansion 
we may continue to consider growth or expansion of our operations in our current markets or in other areas of the country 
our expansion into new or existing markets could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows or profitability 
the magnitude  timing and nature of any future expansion will depend on a number of factors  including suitable acquisition candidates  the negotiation of acceptable terms  our financial capabilities and general economic and business conditions 
new acquisitions may result in the incurrence of additional debt 
acquisitions also involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the acquired company s operations  the incurrence of unanticipated liabilities or expenses  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which we have limited or no direct experience and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 
dependence on key personnel 
our success largely depends on the continuing services of certain key employees  including steve hilton and john landon  and our continued favorable development depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel 
the loss of the services of key employees could harm our business 
dependence on subcontractors 
we conduct our construction operations only as a general contractor 
virtually all architectural and construction work is performed by unaffiliated third party subcontractors 
as a consequence  we depend on the continued availability of and satisfactory performance by these subcontractors for the design and construction of our homes 
we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient availability of and satisfactory performance by these unaffiliated third party subcontractors 
in addition  inadequate subcontractor resources could have a material adverse affect on our business 
inflation 
we  like other homebuilders  may be adversely affected during periods of high inflation  mainly because of higher land and construction costs 
also  higher mortgage interest rates may significantly affect the affordability of mortgage financing to prospective buyers 
inflation also increases our cost of financing  materials and labor and could cause our financial results or growth to decline 
we attempt to pass cost increases on to our customers through higher sales prices 
to date  inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations  although it could impact our future operating results 
natural disasters 
we have significant homebuilding operations in texas and northern california 
some of our markets in texas occasionally experience severe weather conditions such as tornadoes or hurricanes 
northern california has experienced a significant number of earthquakes  flooding  landslides and other natural disasters in recent years 
we do not insure against some of these risks 
these occurrences could damage or destroy some of our homes under construction or our building lots  which may result in losses that exceed our insurance coverage 
we could also suffer significant construction delays or substantial fluctuations in the pricing or availability of building materials 
any of these events could cause a decrease in our revenue  cash flows and earnings 
recent laws  regulations and accounting pronouncements 
in the past several months  a number of new laws  governmental and stock exchange regulations  as well as accounting policies  principles or practices  have been adopted or proposed  many of which could  depending on their ultimate outcome or interpretations  affect our corporate governance or accounting methods 
as an example  the accounting profession recently adopted new standards for whether certain transactions should be accounted for as on or off balance sheet transactions 
we have the right to acquire a substantial amount of lot inventory through rolling options with third parties and  to a lesser extent  joint ventures 
at the present time  we do not believe that these pronouncements  and other current proposals  will materially affect us  however  we cannot assure you that the ultimate interpretation or implementation of new and proposed laws and other pronouncements will not produce such an effect 
acts of war 
acts of war or any outbreak or escalation of hostilities between the united states and any foreign power  including the armed conflict with iraq  may cause disruption to the economy  our company  our employees and our customers  which could impact our revenue  costs and expenses and financial condition 
special note of caution regarding forward looking statements in passing the private securities litigation reform act of pslra  congress encouraged public companies to make forward looking statements by creating a safe harbor to protect companies from securities law liability in connection with forward looking statements 
we intend to qualify both our written and oral forward looking statements for protection under the pslra 
the words believe  expect  anticipate  forecast  plan  and project and similar expressions identify forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date the statement was made 
such forward looking statements are within the meaning of that term in section a of the securities act of  and section e of the exchange act 
forward looking statements in this form k include statements concerning the demand for and the pricing of our homes  our ability to deliver existing backlog  the expected outcome of legal proceedings against us  the sufficiency of our capital resources  the impact of new accounting standards  the future realizability of deferred tax assets  the expectation of continued positive operating results in and beyond  the expected benefits of the hammonds and perma bilt acquisitions  including future home closings and hammonds and perma bilt s future contribution to our revenue and earnings  and our ability to continue positive operating results in light of current economic and political conditions 
such statements are subject to significant risks and uncertainties 
important factors currently known to management that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in forward looking statements  and that could negatively affect our business are discussed in this report under the heading management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations factors that may affect our future results and financial condition 
forward looking statements express expectations of future events 
all forward looking statements are inherently uncertain as they are based on various expectations and assumptions concerning future events and they are subject to numerous known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from those projected 
due to these inherent uncertainties  the investment community is urged not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements 
in addition  we undertake no obligations to update or revise forward looking statements to reflect changed assumptions  the occurrence of anticipated events or changes to projections over time 
as a result of these and other factors  our stock and note prices may fluctuate dramatically 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a result of our senior unsecured notes offering  million of our outstanding borrowings is based on a fixed interest rate 
except in limited circumstances  we do not have an obligation to prepay our fixed rate debt prior to maturity and  as a result  interest rate risk and changes in fair value should not have a significant impact in the fixed rate debt until we would be required to refinance such debt 
we are exposed to market risk primarily related to potential adverse changes in interest rates on our existing revolving credit facility 
the interest rate relative to this borrowing fluctuates with the prime and eurodollar lending rates  both upwards and downwards 
as of december   we had approximately million drawn under our revolving credit facility that is subject to changes in interest rates 
an increase or decrease of in interest rates would change our annual debt service payments by approximately million per year 
we do not enter into  or intend to enter into  derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
our operations are interest rate sensitive 
overall housing demand is adversely affected by increases in interest rates 
if mortgage interest rates increase significantly  this may negatively affect the ability of homebuyers to secure adequate financing 
higher interest rates could adversely affect our revenues  gross margins and net income and will also increase our borrowing costs because our revolving credit facility will fluctuate with the prime and eurodollar lending rates  both upwards and downwards
