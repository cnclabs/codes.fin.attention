critical accounting policies the securities and exchange commission sec has issued cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain and may change materially in subsequent periods 
the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and related notes 
significant estimates made by the company include evaluation of the recoverability of assets  such as accounts receivable  inventories  long lived assets and income tax assets  and the assessment of litigation and other contingencies 
the company s ability to collect accounts receivable and recover the value of its inventories depends on a number of factors  including the financial condition of its customers  the effect of changes in economic conditions and its ability to enforce provisions of its contracts in the event of disputes  through litigation if necessary 
the recoverability of long lived assets is highly dependant on the company s business volume and application of the applicable accounting standards requires significant judgments and estimates 
the company provides reserves or accrues liabilities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for events such as site closures  to record assets at estimated net realizable values and to record probable contingent liabilities 
the amounts of such reserves and liabilities are based on information and assumptions that the company deems reasonable and probable at the time 
the matters that give rise to such provisions are inherently uncertain and may require complex and subjective judgments 
although the company believes the estimates and assumptions used in determining the recorded amounts of net assets and liabilities at december  are reasonable  actual results could differ materially from the estimated amounts recorded in the company s financial statements
