item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  contained elsewhere in this report  before deciding to invest in our company or to maintain or increase your investment 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses for each period 
the following represents a summary of our critical accounting policies  defined as those policies that we believe are a the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and b that require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
sales 
we record sales in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  as amended by sab a and b 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we record sales when we have received a valid customer purchase order for product at a stated price  the customer s credit is approved and we have shipped the product to the customer 
valuation of accounts receivable 
we maintain an allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable to estimate the risk of extending credit to customers 
the allowance is estimated based on customer compliance with credit terms  the financial condition of the customer and collection history where applicable 
additional allowances could be required if the financial condition of our customers were to be impaired beyond our estimates 
valuation of inventory 
inventory is valued at the lower of cost estimated using the first in  first out method or market 
we periodically evaluate the carrying value of inventories and maintain an allowance for obsolescence to adjust the carrying value as necessary to the lower of cost or market 
the allowance is based on physical and technical functionality as well as other factors affecting the recoverability of the asset through future sales 
unfavorable changes in estimates of obsolete inventory would result in an increase in the allowance and a decrease in gross profit 
valuation of long lived assets 
property  plant and equipment  intangible and certain other long lived assets are amortized over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenue or otherwise productively support our business goals 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
table of contents amount of an asset may not be recoverable through future business operations 
in our estimate  no provision for impairment is currently required on any of our long lived assets 
warranty cost 
products sold are generally covered by a warranty against defects in material and workmanship for a period of one year 
we accrue a warranty reserve to estimate the risk of incurring costs to provide warranty services 
the accrual is based on our historical experience and our expectation of future conditions 
an increase in warranty claims or in the costs associated with servicing those claims would result in an increase in the accrual and a decrease in gross profit 
litigation and other contingencies 
we regularly evaluate our exposure to threatened or pending litigation and other business contingencies 
because of the uncertainties related to the amount of loss from litigation and other business contingencies  the recording of losses relating to such exposures requires significant judgment about the potential range of outcomes 
we are not presently affected by any litigation or other contingencies that have had  or are currently anticipated to have  a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
as additional information about current or future litigation or other contingencies becomes available  we will assess whether such information warrants the recording of additional expense relating to its contingencies 
to be recorded as expense  a loss contingency must generally be both probable and measurable 
if a loss contingency is material but is not both probable and estimable  we will disclose it in notes to the financial statements 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain statement of operations data expressed as a percentage of net sales years ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses sales and marketing general and administrative engineering and development total operating expenses income loss from operations non operating income loss net income loss comparing the results of operations between the current year and the prior years  the most significant change affecting operating results is the increase in sales 
sales for the year ended december  increased over sales for the year ended december  sales for the year ended december  increased over sales for the year ended december 
table of contents net sales 
net sales for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  as compared with net sales of million for the year ended december  net sales for the year ended december  increased million over net sales of million for the year ended december  the increase in sales in both and resulted primarily from the increased number of units sold of our waterlase and lasersmile introduced in the third quarter of systems 
the average selling price increased slightly for these products in the periods being compared 
international sales were million for the year ended december  of total net sales  as compared to million in of total net sales and million in of total net sales 
the increase in international sales in was primarily the result of a renewed effort to strengthen our network of international distributors after concentrating our resources in in the domestic market 
the formation of biolase europe in and the acquisition of a production and service facility in germany was an important step to increase our visibility in europe as well as to improve our ability to service european customers 
we plan to continue to add resources to our international sales program to take advantage of the large market potential and we expect that our international sales will continue to grow over time as a percentage of our total net sales 
although most of our international sales are made through independent distributors  we began making direct sales to dentists in europe in with the support of our current european distributors 
based on the overall increase and detailed review of sales  we have increased our allowance on accounts receivable from  at december  to  at december  gross profit 
gross profit for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
the gross margin on sales for those same periods was  and  respectively 
the increase in both gross profit and gross margin was primarily attributable to leveraging the increase in our net sales against fixed and partially fixed manufacturing costs  reflecting better absorption of fixed manufacturing costs 
the increase in gross profit is also due to increased manufacturing efficiencies and design changes through engineering and product development  which have reduced the cost of materials 
these efficiencies and cost savings were partially offset by the start up costs for our german production and service facility in and the addition of production resources to support anticipated sales growth 
while we believe there is additional leverage to be realized from future increases in sales  step costs or increases in fixed costs will also accompany growth and may constrain increases in gross margin 
in addition  an increase in the mix of sales to international distributors will also tend to decrease gross profit since such sales are made at wholesale prices 
operating expenses 
operating expenses for the years ended december   and were  and of net sales  respectively 
most of the increases in operating expenses for each year were sales and marketing costs that were incurred primarily to generate the increase in sales  including a growing sales force and related expenses 
sales and marketing expenses primarily include salaries and commissions for our direct sales force  advertising costs and expenses related to trade shows  conventions and seminars 
sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  was million compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars from year to year was primarily attributable to higher commission expense related to the increased sales and to additional sales personnel in the united states 
in addition during  we significantly expanded the scope of our nationwide seminar marketing program and increased our sponsorship of education and training programs for existing and potential customers 
although growing in and in in absolute dollars  sales and marketing expense as a percentage of net sales decreased from in to in to in due to the increase in sales generated by these 
table of contents efforts 
in we sponsored two national and two international symposiums presented by the world clinical laser institute  an organization that provides education and training in laser dentistry 
general and administrative expenses include the salaries of administrative personnel as well as legal  professional  insurance and regulatory fees 
general and administrative expense for the year ended december  was million compared with million in and million in the increase in absolute dollars in was principally due to administrative costs associated with the operations of biolase europe  increases in the costs of legal fees relating to regulatory compliance and various legal proceedings and increases in the infrastructure needed to support the growth of our sales 
insurance premiums increased in primarily as a result of the increase in net sales and increased significantly in both as a result of the increase in sales and as a result of general insurance market conditions 
we expect additional increases in due to adverse markets for workers compensation  group health insurance and liability insurance 
engineering and development expenses include engineering personnel salaries  prototype supplies and contract services 
engineering and development expenses for the year ended december  was million  compared with million in and million in the increase in absolute dollars in was primarily related to new product development and enhancements 
the decrease in absolute dollars from to was primarily related to the completion of the development of the lasersmile product as well as process improvements 
the decrease in research and development expenses as a percent of net sales reflects the larger sales base and fluctuations in the scope of current research and development projects 
gain on sale of assets 
the gain on sale of assets for the year ended december  of  was related to the sale and leaseback of our manufacturing facility in san clemente  california in march this sale resulted in a gain of  which is being recognized over the remaining term of the lease  which expires in gain on sales of assets in included this amortization of deferred gain plus a gain on the sale of certain other assets 
unrealized gain on forward exchange contract 
in the year ended december  we recognized an unrealized gain on forward contracts of  due to the increase in the fair market value of our forward exchange contract as described more fully in part ii  item a of this report 
interest income interest expense 
interest income relates to interest earned on our cash balances  and interest expense primarily relates to interest expense on our line of credit and our prior mortgage on the san clemente facility 
interest income for the year ended december  was  compared to  in and  in even though our cash balances have increased over this period  continuing reductions in interest rates have resulted in lower interest income 
interest expense was  for the year ended december  compared to  in and  in interest expense in included the amortization of the cost of issuing stock in connection with the extension of our line of credit in december interest expense in included three months of interest on the note payable on our san clemente manufacturing facility  which was sold and leased back in march interest expense in included both the mortgage note interest as well as interest on our line of credit 
provision for income tax 
no provision for income tax was recognized for the year ended december  due to the availability of net operating loss carry forwards 
no income tax benefit was recognized in the year period ended december  as there was no assurance that the benefit of the net operating loss carry forwards would be realized 
at such time  if in our judgment the recoverability of deferred tax assets  including the net operating loss carry forward  becomes realizable  we will reduce the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  record an income tax benefit and 
table of contents subsequently record a provision for income tax for financial statement purposes based on the amount of income recorded 
as of december   we had net operating loss carry forwards for federal and state purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  which began expiring in as of december   we had research and development credit carryforwards for federal and state purposes of approximately  and  respectively 
the utilization of net operating loss and credit carryforwards may be limited under the provisions of internal revenue code section and similar state provisions 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million in net working capital as compared to million at december  our principal source of liquidity at december  consisted of our cash balance of million 
prior to  we financed the development of our products and our operations principally through the private placement of common stock and the exercise of stock options and warrants 
for the year ended december   our primary sources of cash were from operating activities of  and the exercise of stock options and warrants of million 
these sources of cash were decreased by investments in property and equipment of  the net effect on cash of operating  investing and financing transactions for the year ended december   was an increase of million 
for further details see the consolidated statements of cash flows included in this form k 
accounts receivable  net  increased to million at december  from million at december  this increase was primarily due to the higher sales volume experienced in inventories  net  increased to million at december  from million at december  this increase was primarily due to increased production to meet estimated sales demand 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements   warrants with a weighted average exercise price of are outstanding and are scheduled to expire in during the first quarter of   of those warrants were exercised and we expect the balance to be exercised before their expiration dates if our stock price remains above the exercise price 
at december   we had million outstanding under a million revolving credit facility with a bank 
this same amount was outstanding at december  the interest rate is based upon libor plus 
at december   the interest rate on the outstanding balance was 
in june  the expiration date on this credit facility was extended from january  to july   at which point we will be required to pay any remaining balance  refinance or replace the credit facility 
the credit facility is collateralized by all of our accounts receivable and inventories 
we are currently negotiating with lenders to replace this line of credit with a larger credit facility  but we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing  on acceptable terms or at all 
in connection with the acquisition of our production facility in germany  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  biolase europe incurred a maximum liability of  payable in euros at the conversion rate of euros 
we are required to make a payment of euros  by april  we are currently negotiating with the seller and a third party for that third party to pay between  and  of the purchase price in exchange for certain rights that would be granted to the third party 
if we are not able to reach an agreement in this regard  we will be required to make another installment of  on september  the balance of the amounts owed  if any  will be due by december  at december   the balance outstanding was euros  or million 
we are considering obtaining alternate financing to refinance this debt 
table of contents as it matures  but we cannot assure you that such financing will be available in a timely manner  on acceptable terms or at all 
we had no material commitments for capital expenditures as of december  the following table presents our expected cash requirements for contractual obligations outstanding as of december  total line of credit long term debt operating leases total our liquidity and cash requirements fluctuate based on the timing and extent of a number of factors 
for instance  during periods of recent sales growth  net changes in our assets and liabilities generally have represented a use of cash because we have incurred costs and expended cash in advance of receiving cash from our customers 
we believe that our current cash balances  cash expected to be generated from our operations  together with additional cash expected to be received through the exercise of warrants and stock options will be adequate to meet our debt service requirements and sustain our operations for at least the next twelve months 
should we require further capital resources in the next twelve months  we may address such requirement through the refinancing of debt and or the sale of equity securities 
if such additional debt or equity is needed  we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain such additional capital resources in a timely manner  on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to raise additional funds  we may have to defer the creation or satisfaction of various commitments  defer the introduction of various products or entry into various markets  or otherwise scale back our operations 
if additional capital were needed  and we were unable to raise such additional capital or defer certain costs as described above  such inability would have an adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows

new accounting pronouncements in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 rescission of sfas nos 
 and  amendment of sfas no 
 and technical corrections 
the significant items from sfas that are relevant to biolase are the provisions regarding extinguishment of debt and the accounting for sale leaseback transactions 
the provisions of this statement are applicable for financial statements issued on or subsequent to may  we believe that the adoption of this statement does not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements

table of contents the obligations it assumes under that guarantee and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of the interpretation apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the adoption of this statement does not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no

in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirement of statement to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
sfas is effective for fiscal years ending after december  since we are continuing to account for stock based compensation according to apb  our adoption of sfas no 
requires us to provide prominent disclosures about the effects of fas on reported income and will require us to disclose these affects in the interim financial statements as well 

table of contents risk factors our business is subject to a number of risks  some of which are discussed below 
other risks are presented elsewhere in this report and in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
before deciding to invest in our company or to maintain or increase your investment  you should carefully consider the risks described below  in addition to the other information contained in this report and in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business operations 
if any of these risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be seriously harmed 
in that event  the market price for our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 
dentists and physicians may be slow to adopt laser technologies  which could limit the market acceptance of our products 
although our sales have increased year over year  our products represent new technologies in the dental market and currently only represent a very small portion of the market 
our future success will depend on continued momentum in demand  our ability to demonstrate to a broad spectrum of dentists and physicians the potential performance advantages including clinical  cost  marketing and office practice of our laser systems over traditional methods of treatment and over competitive laser systems 
dental practitioners have historically been and may continue to be slow to adopt new technologies on a widespread basis 
factors that may inhibit mass adoption of laser technologies by dentists and physicians include the cost of the products  concerns about the safety  efficacy and reliability of lasers and the ability to obtain reimbursement of laser procedures under health plans 
current economic pressure may make dentists and physicians reluctant to purchase substantial capital equipment or invest in new technologies 
the failure of medical lasers to achieve broad market acceptance would have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to continue to successfully market our products to achieve broad market acceptance 
we depend on a limited number of suppliers and if we cannot secure alternate suppliers  the amount of sales in any period could be adversely affected 
we purchase certain materials and components included in our products from a limited group of qualified suppliers  and we do not have long term supply contracts with most of our key suppliers 
our growth and ability to meet customer demand depends in part on our ability to obtain timely deliveries of materials and components in acceptable quality from our suppliers 
certain components of our products are currently available only from a single source or limited sources  particularly specialized components used in our lasers 
although we believe that alternate sources of supply are available for most of our single sourced materials and components  a change in a single or limited source supplier  or an inability to find an alternate supplier  would create manufacturing delays  disrupt sales and cash flow  and harm our reputation  any of which would adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our quarterly sales and operating results may fluctuate in future periods and we may fail to meet expectations  which may cause the price of our common stock to decline 
our quarterly sales and operating results have fluctuated and are likely to continue to vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  many of which are not within our control 
if quarterly sales or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts  the price of our 
table of contents common stock could decline substantially 
factors that might cause quarterly fluctuations in our sales and operating results include the following variation in demand for our products  including variation due to seasonality  our ability to develop  introduce  market and gain market acceptance of new products and product enhancements in a timely manner  our ability to control costs  the size  timing  rescheduling or cancellation of significant customer orders  the introduction of new products by competitors  the availability and reliability of components used to manufacture our products  changes in our pricing policies or those of our suppliers and competitors  as well as increased price competition in general  the mix of our domestic and international sales  and the risks and uncertainties associated with our international business  costs associated with any future acquisitions of technologies and businesses  and general global economic and political conditions  including international conflicts and acts of terrorism 
a significant amount of our sales in any quarter may consist of sales through a single distributor 
as a result  the timing of orders by distributors may impact our quarter to quarter results 
the loss of or a substantial reduction in orders from distributors could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the variation in demand due to seasonality may also cause variation in operating results 
since many of our costs are fixed in the short term  if we have a shortfall in sales  we may be unable to reduce expenses quickly enough to avoid losses 
due to all of the factors listed above and other risks  some of which are discussed in this report  you should not rely on quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results as an indication of our future performance 
we may not be able to secure additional financing to meet our future capital needs 
our secured line of credit expires on july  if we are unable to renew or replace our secured line of credit at or before that time on acceptable terms  or at all  and we are required to repay the secured line of credit  absent sufficient cash flow from operations or the sale of securities  the diversion of resources for that purpose would adversely affect our operations and financial condition and our ability to achieve future growth in our net sales  and our assets securing the loan may be at risk 
in addition  during  all of our long term debt related to the acquisition of our german production facility will become due and payable 
although management expects to be able to secure a new credit facility to refinance the maturing debt  there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing on acceptable terms in a timely manner  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain such financing  we will have to repay our debt obligations with cash  which may adversely affect our operations and financial condition and our ability to achieve future growth in our net sales 

table of contents although we believe that we can generate sufficient cash flow from sustained profitability to meet our future operating and capital needs  there is no assurance that we will be able to do so 
if we are unable to do so  we will be dependent on the availability of external financing to meet our operating and capital needs  including the repayment of current debt obligations 
we may not be able to secure additional debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us  or at all  at the time when we need such funding 
if we do raise funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities  the ownership percentages of existing stockholders would be reduced  and the securities that we issue may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock or may be issued at a discount to the current market price of our common stock which would result in dilution to our existing stockholders 
if we raise additional funds by issuing debt  we may be subject to debt covenants  which could place limitations on our operations including our ability to declare and pay dividends 
our inability to raise additional funds on a timely basis would make it difficult for us to achieve our business plan and would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have significant international sales and are subject to risks associated with operating in international markets 
international sales comprise a significant portion of our net sales and we intend to continue to pursue and expand our international business activities 
political and economic conditions outside the united states could make it difficult for us to increase our international sales or to operate abroad 
international operations  including our facility in germany  are subject to many inherent risks  including adverse changes in tariffs  political  social and economic instability and increased security concerns  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  longer collection periods and difficulties in collecting receivables from foreign entities  exposure to different legal standards  reduced protection for our intellectual property in some countries  burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws  import and export license requirements and restrictions of the united states and each other country in which we operate  trade restrictions  the imposition of governmental controls  unexpected changes in regulatory or certification requirements  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  and potentially adverse tax consequences and the complexities of foreign value added tax systems 

table of contents we believe that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of our net sales  and that continued growth and profitability may require further expansion of our international operations 
a substantial percentage of our international sales are denominated in the local currency 
as a result  an increase in the relative value of the dollar could make our products more expensive and potentially less price competitive in international markets 
we do not currently engage in any transactions as a hedge against risks of loss due to foreign currency fluctuations 
any of these factors may adversely affect our future international sales and  consequently  affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
if we are not successful in generating and increasing sales from our german production facility  our business and financial condition may be materially adversely affected 
in february  we made a significant investment in purchasing a german production facility with ten employees 
the production facility has a very limited operating history upon which to assess whether it will be able to meet all of the challenges required to successfully operate and generate and increase sales 
if we are not able to generate and increase sales and profits at the german facility  we will not receive the anticipated benefits of our investment in the german facility and our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
we are exposed to risks associated with the recent worldwide economic slowdown and related uncertainties 
concerns about decreased consumer and investor confidence  reduced corporate profits and capital spending  and recent international conflicts and terrorist and military activity have resulted in a downturn in the equity markets and a slowdown in economic conditions  both domestically and internationally  and have caused concern about the strength or longevity of an economic recovery 
these unfavorable conditions could ultimately cause a slowdown in customer orders or cause customer order cancellations 
in addition  recent political and social turmoil related to international conflicts and terrorist acts may put further pressure on economic conditions in the us and worldwide 
unstable political  social and economic conditions make it difficult for our customers  our suppliers and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities 
if such conditions continue or worsen  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights  our competitive position could be harmed or we could be required to incur expenses to enforce our rights 
we anticipate that our future success will depend  in part  on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection for our products and technology  to preserve our trade secrets and to operate without infringing the intellectual property of others 
in part  we rely on patents to establish and maintain proprietary rights in our technology and products 
while we hold a number of issued patents and have other patent applications pending on our products and technology  we cannot assure you that any additional patents will be issued  that the scope of any patent protection will exclude competitors or that any of our patents will be held valid if subsequently challenged 
in addition  other companies may independently develop similar products  duplicate our products or design products that circumvent our patents 
competitors may claim that we have infringed their current or future intellectual property rights 
we may not prevail in any future intellectual property infringement litigation given the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in litigation 
any claims  with or without merit  could be time consuming and distracting to management  result in costly litigation  cause product shipment delays  or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
additionally  in the event an intellectual property 
table of contents claim against us is successful  we might not be able to obtain a license on acceptable terms or license a substitute technology or redesign our products to avoid infringement 
any of the foregoing adverse events could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
potential future acquisitions could have unintended negative consequences which could harm our business and cause our stock price to decline 
we are considering pursuing additional acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies in the future as a part of our growth strategy 
acquisitions could require significant capital infusions and could involve many risks  including but not limited to the following we may encounter difficulties in assimilating and integrating the operations  products and workforce of the acquired companies  acquisitions may materially and adversely affect our results of operations because they may require large one time charges or could result in increased debt or contingent liabilities  adverse tax consequences  substantial depreciation or deferred compensation charges  or the amortization or write down of amounts related to deferred compensation  goodwill and other intangible assets  acquisitions may be dilutive to our existing stockholders  acquisitions may disrupt our ongoing business and distract our management  and key personnel of the acquired company may decide not to work for us 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to identify or consummate any future acquisitions on acceptable terms  or at all 
in the event we do pursue any acquisitions  it is possible that we may not realize the anticipated benefits from such acquisitions or that the market will positively view such acquisitions 
product liability claims against us could be costly and could harm our reputation 
the sale of dental and medical products involves the inherent risk of product liability claims against us 
while we currently maintain product liability insurance coverage  this insurance is expensive  is subject to various coverage exclusions and limits and may not be obtainable in the future on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
we do not know whether claims against us  if any  with respect to our products would be successfully defended or whether our insurance would be sufficient to cover liabilities resulting from such claims 
rapid changes in technology could harm the demand for our products or result in significant additional costs 
the markets in which our laser products compete are subject to rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  changes in the regulatory environment  frequent new device and pharmaceutical introductions and evolving dental and surgical techniques 
these changes could render our products noncompetitive or obsolete 
the success of our existing and future products is dependent on the differentiation of our products from those of our competitors  the timely introduction of new products and the perceived benefit to the customer in terms of patient service and return on investment 
the process of developing new medical devices is inherently complex and requires regulatory approvals or 
table of contents clearances that can be expensive  time consuming and uncertain 
we have in the past experienced delays in product development 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully identify new product opportunities  be financially or otherwise capable of the research and development to bring new products to market in a timely manner or that product and technologies developed by others will not render our products obsolete 
we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors 
we compete with a number of foreign and domestic companies  including companies that market traditional dental products such as dental drills  as well as other companies that market laser technologies in the dental and medical markets that we address 
some of our competitors have greater financial  technical  marketing or other resources than us  which may allow them to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and to devote greater resources to the acquisition or development and introduction of enhanced products than we can 
in addition  the rapid technological changes occurring in the healthcare industry are expected to lead to the entry of new competitors  especially as dental and medical lasers gain increasing market acceptance 
our ability to anticipate technological changes and to introduce enhanced products on a timely basis will be a significant factor in our ability to grow and remain competitive 
new competitors or technology changes in laser products and methods could cause commoditization of such products  require price discounting or otherwise adversely affect our gross margins 
changes in government regulation or the inability to obtain necessary government approvals could harm our business 
our products are subject to extensive government regulation  both in the united states and other countries 
to clinically test  manufacture and market products for human diagnostic and therapeutic use  we must comply with regulations and safety standards set by the us food and drug administration and comparable state and foreign agencies 
generally  products must meet regulatory standards as safe and effective for their intended use prior to being marketed for human applications 
the clearance process is expensive  time consuming and uncertain 
the failure to receive requisite approvals for the use of our products or processes  or significant delays in obtaining such approvals  could prevent us from developing  manufacturing and marketing products and services necessary for us to remain competitive 
if our customers cannot obtain third party reimbursement for their use of our products  they may be less inclined to purchase our products 
our products are generally purchased by dental or medical professionals who have various billing practices and patient mixes 
such practices range from primarily private pay to those who heavily use third party payors  such as private insurance or government programs 
in the united states  third party payors review and frequently challenge the prices charged for medical services 
in many foreign countries  the prices are predetermined through government regulation 
payors may deny coverage and reimbursement if they determine that the procedure was not medically necessary for example  cosmetic or that the device used in the procedure was investigational 
we believe that most of the procedures being performed with our current products generally are reimbursable  with the exception of cosmetic applications such as tooth whitening 
for the portion of dentists who rely on third party reimbursement and take assignment of patient insurance claims  the inability to obtain reimbursement for services using our products could deter them from purchasing or using our products 
we cannot predict the effect of future healthcare reforms or changes in financing for health and dental plans 
any such changes could have an adverse effect on the ability of a dental or medical professional to generate a return on investment using our current or future products 
such changes could act as disincentives for capital investments by 
table of contents dental and medical professionals and could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the failure to attract and retain key personnel could adversely affect our business 
our future success depends in part on the continued service of certain key personnel  including our chief executive officer  our chief financial officer  our vice president of clinical research  and our executive vice president 
we do not have employment agreements with any of our key employees  other than with our chief executive officer  whose employment agreement was renewed in january for a two year term 
our success will also depend in large part on our ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified engineering and other highly skilled technical personnel 
competition for certain employees  particularly development engineers  is intense despite the effects of the economic slowdown 
we may not be able to continue to attract and retain sufficient numbers of such highly skilled employees 
our inability to attract and retain additional key employees or the loss of one or more of our current key employees could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to sustain or increase our net income in the future  which may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline 
although we expect to be able to sustain and grow net income  there is no assurance that we will be able to do so 
our ability to sustain or increase net income is dependent on many of the risk factors identified in this report 
until the third quarter of  we had a prior history of losses through our research and development phase and during the early commercialization of our products 
it is possible that we may experience losses again in the future 
if we are unable to sustain or increase our net income in the future  we may not be able to successfully operate our business and our stock price may decline 
our common stock price has been volatile  which could result in substantial losses for stockholders 
our common stock is currently traded on the nasdaq national market and the nasdaq europe market and has limited daily trading volume 
the trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile 
the market for technology companies  in particular  has  from time to time  experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may significantly affect the trading price of our common stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 
for example  the closing per share sale price of our common stock has fluctuated between and over the course of despite steady improvement in our financial performance 
on august   the closing sale price of our common stock declined from per share on volume of approximately  shares  absent any news about or announcements by us 
the trading price of our common stock could be affected by a number of factors  including  but not limited to  changes in expectations of our future performance  changes in estimates by securities analysts or failure to meet such estimates  quarterly fluctuations in our sales and financial results and a variety of risk factors  including the ones described elsewhere in this report 
periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities sometimes result in securities class action litigation 
if this were to happen to us  such litigation would be expensive and would divert management s attention 
in addition  if we needed to raise equity funds under adverse conditions it would be difficult to sell a significant amount of our stock without causing a significant decline in the trading price of our stock 
if our stock price drops below per share for an extended period of time or we are otherwise unable to satisfy the continued listing requirements of the nasdaq national market  our shares 
table of contents could be delisted from the nasdaq national market and the marketability  liquidity and price of our common stock would be adversely affected 
future sales of our common stock could affect the stock price 
if our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock  including shares issued on the exercise of options and warrants  in the public market  the market price of our common stock could fall 
these sales also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate 
we have adopted anti takeover defenses that could delay or prevent an acquisition of our company and may affect the price of our common stock 
certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and stockholder rights plan could make it difficult for a third party to acquire us  even though an acquisition might be beneficial to our stockholders 
these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to  shares on a specified pro rata basis to shareholders of record of blank check preferred stock  which will have terms as may be determined from time to time by our board of directors 
accordingly  our board of directors may  without obtaining stockholder approval  issue preferred stock with terms  which could have preference over and adversely affect the rights of the holders of common stock 
this issuance may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
we are also subject to the delaware anti takeover laws  which may prevent  delay or impede a merger or takeover of our company  and we have not opted out of the provisions of such laws through either our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws 
in december  we adopted a stockholder rights plan pursuant to which one preferred stock purchase right is distributed to our stockholders for each share of our common stock held by them 
in the event that a third party acquires or more of our outstanding common stock  the holders of these rights will be able to purchase the underlying junior participating preferred stock as a way to discourage  delay or prevent a change in control of our company 
the mere existence of a stockholder rights plan often delays or makes a merger  tender offer or proxy contest more difficult 
the existence of these features could prevent others from seeking to acquire shares of our common stock in transactions at premium prices
