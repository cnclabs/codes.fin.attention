critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these 
table of contents financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates to ensure they are consistent with historical experience and the various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and could materially impact the company s results of operations 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies are affected by significant judgements and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements income tax accruals and valuation allowances significant management judgement is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
due to uncertainties related to the company s ability to utilize some portion of the deferred tax assets as well as uncertainties associated with normal and customary audits of the company s tax returns in certain jurisdictions  a valuation allowance of million has been recorded as of december  the future recoverability of the company s net deferred tax assets of million as of december  is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income  primarily in the us the company believes that it will generate future taxable income to recover the recorded net deferred tax assets

significant management judgement is also required to estimate the probable outcomes associated with normal and customary audits of the company s tax returns in the various jurisdictions in which it operates 
accruals related to divested businesses on november   the company sold substantially all of its worldwide medical imaging systems business to eastman kodak company kodak 
excluded from this sale was the ferrania facility  at which certain x ray and wet laser medical imaging products and photographic film were manufactured 
on august   the company closed on the sale of its worldwide photo color systems business  including the ferrania facility  to ferrania lux 
the kodak asset purchase agreement obligated kodak to pay to the company up to million under certain conditions upon the sale of the ferrania facility 
kodak has challenged the company s claim for the full million as well as claims for other amounts which the company believes are due from kodak in connection with the sale of the medical imaging systems business 
the company has retained cash  which it collected on behalf of kodak in an amount approximately equal to these disputes 
while the company cannot predict with certainty the outcome of these disputes  it believes its positions are supported by the applicable contractual terms 
the company has also established certain accruals for future costs associated with the sale of its color proofing and color software business to kpg as well as the sale of its north america dss business to decisionone 
the company believes these accruals closely approximate the amount of these future costs 
significant management assumptions and estimates have been required in assessing the most likely outcome from these divestitures and there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from these estimates used in recording these transactions 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  the company may need to make an adjustment  upward or downward  in its statement of operations 
in  the company recorded a charge of million  net of income taxes of million  resulting from the adjustment of estimated costs associated with discontinued operations revenue recognition in  the company changed its revenue recognition policy for product revenues  such that revenue is recognized when the risks and rewards of ownership pass  which is primarily upon delivery of goods to customers see note to the consolidated financial statements

table of contents restructuring accruals in establishing the accrual for the restructuring costs discussed in note to consolidated financial statements  the company made certain assumptions to estimate future severance costs  pension and post employment benefits  and other exit costs 
in addition  while performing impairment tests for certain long term assets  assumptions were made as to the future cash flows associated with these assets 
while management feels the assumptions were appropriate  there can be no assurance that actual costs will not differ from estimates used to establish the restructuring accrual 
if actual results differ from the estimates  the company may need to adjust  upward or downward  its restructuring accrual in the future 
the company made adjustments to its restructuring programs in and see note to the consolidated financial statements 
litigation management s current estimated range of liability related to pending litigation is based on claims for which the company can estimate the amount and range of loss 
based upon information presently available  management believes that accruals for these claims are adequate 
due to uncertainties related to both the amount and range of loss on the remaining pending litigation  the company is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
as additional information becomes available  potential liability related to pending litigation will be assessed and estimates may be revised 
inventory obsolescence accruals the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory to the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
rebates the company maintains an accrual for customer rebates which totaled million as of december  this accrual requires estimation of various customer program outcomes based on a variety of factors including customer unit volumes and end user redemption rates 
in the event that actual volumes and redemption rates differ from the estimates used in the accrual calculation  adjustments to the accrual  upward or downward  may be necessary 
other accrued liabilities the company also maintains other accrued liabilities  including uninsured claims and pensions 
these accruals are based on a variety of factors including past experience and various actuarial assumptions and  in many cases  require estimates of events not yet reported to the company 
if future experience differs from these estimates  operating results in future periods would be impacted

certain risks and uncertainties faced by the company are outlined below 
competitive industry conditions the company operates in a highly competitive environment 
the company s competitors are both larger and smaller than the company in terms of resources and market share 
the marketplaces in which the company operates are generally characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions  a variety of distribution channels  relatively large and aggressive marketing efforts  and aggressive pricing practices which result in consistent price erosion 
driving demand in the data storage industry is an expanding need to access  manage  and store information more rapidly and at lower cost  with greater accuracy and reliability 
in particular  the data storage industry is undergoing rapid technology and market changes  and the variety of data storage media formats available for customers is increasing 
the data storage market is characterized by short product development cycles that are driven by rapidly changing technology and consumer preferences as well as declining product prices 
in these highly competitive markets  the company s success will depend to a significant extent on its ability to continue to develop and introduce differentiated and innovative products  services and customer solutions cost effectively and on a timely basis 
the success of the company s offerings is dependent on several factors including its ability to develop relationships with distributors and oems  competitive technology capabilities  differentiation from competitive offerings  the timing of new product introductions  effectiveness of marketing programs  and low manufacturing costs 
although the company believes that it can take the necessary steps to meet the competitive challenges of these marketplaces  no assurance can be given with regard to the company s ability to take these steps  the actions of competitors  some of which will have greater resources than the company  or the pace of technological changes 
new products and services the company s competitive position and operating results are dependent upon its ability to successfully develop  manufacture  and market innovative new products and services

sale of medical imaging systems business as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  on november   the company sold substantially all of its worldwide medical imaging systems business to kodak 
excluded from this sale was the ferrania facility  at which certain x ray and wet laser medical imaging products and photographic film were manufactured 
as also discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  on august   the company closed on the sale of its worldwide photo color systems business  including the ferrania facility  to ferrania lux 
the kodak asset purchase agreement obligated kodak to pay to the company up to million under certain conditions upon the sale of the ferrania facility

consequently  as of december   the company is unable to ascertain the ultimate aggregate amount of any monetary liability or financial impact that may be incurred by the company with respect to these matters

in addition  the company s business and financial results are affected by fluctuations in world financial markets  including foreign currency exchange rates 
the company s foreign currency hedging policy attempts to manage some of these risks over near term periods  however  these risk management activities cannot assure that these programs will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates or that medium and longer term effects of exchange rates will not be significant 
the company is exposed to various market risks  including volatility in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
these exposures primarily relate to the sale of products to foreign customers  purchases from foreign suppliers  acquisition of raw materials from both domestic and foreign suppliers  and changes in interest rates 
the company may  from time to time  utilize derivative financial instruments  including forward exchange contracts  options and swap agreements to manage certain of these exposures when it is considered practical to do so in accordance with established policies and procedures 
there can be no assurances that such an approach will be successful  especially in the event of a significant and sudden decline in the value of local currencies 
factors that could impact the effectiveness of the company s hedging include accuracy of revenue forecasts  volatility of the currency markets  and availability of hedging instruments 
although the company attempts to utilize transaction hedging to manage the impact of changes in currency exchange rates  when the us dollar sustains a strengthening position against currencies in which the company sells products or a weakening exchange rate against currencies in which the company incurs costs  the company s revenues or costs may be adversely impacted 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes and is not a party to leveraged derivative transactions 

table of contents as of december   the company had million notional amount of foreign currency forward and option contracts of which million hedged recorded balance sheet exposures 
this compares to million notional amount of foreign currency forward and option contracts as of december   of which million hedged recorded balance sheet exposures 
a hypothetical adverse change of percent in year end foreign currency exchange rates would reduce the fair value of foreign currency contracts outstanding as of december  by million
