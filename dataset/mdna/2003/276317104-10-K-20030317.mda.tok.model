item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations net income for totaled million  or 
per diluted share  on sales of million 
these results represent a decrease in net income from and a decrease in sales 
net income for was million  or per diluted share  on sales of million 
net income declined more sharply than sales because the company incurred additional costs related to workers compensation  higher property and liability premiums as a result of a tight insurance market  higher health insurance costs  and increased pension expenses due to the declines in the stock market 
the company ended with a backlog level above that at year end  totaling million 
net income for the fourth quarter totaled million  or 
per diluted share  on sales of million 
these figures represent a decline in net income and a increase in sales from net income for the fourth quarter totaled million  or 
per diluted share  on sales of million 
the increase in sales was mainly due to the acquisition of canadian commercial vehicles in the fourth quarter of the decline in earnings was due to a one time gain of  per diluted share recorded in the fourth quarter as the result of the company s receiving approximately  shares of prudential financial inc common stock 
the gross margin for the fourth quarter of was of net sales as compared to for the fourth quarter of product mix and higher costs related to insurance  workers compensation and pensions accounted for the reduction in the gross margin percentage 
selling and administrative expenses in the fourth quarter totaled million  a decrease from the level 
this decrease was mainly due to lower advertising expenses in results of operations the following table shows  for  each line item from the consolidated statements of income as a percentage of net sales 
net sales cost of products sold gross margin selling and administrative expense other income interest expense income before income taxes income taxes net income fiscal compared to fiscal net sales for decreased million to million from million for volume of existing products reduced sales by  while new product introductions raised sales by 
the industrial hardware segment experienced a increase in sales 
volume of existing products decreased sales by  while internally developed new products for the utility truck and vehicular accessory markets increased sales by 
sales of heavy hardware to the tractor trailer industry decreased from levels 
sales to this market have been down since the latter half of in the second quarter of  the trailer industry began to see signs of recovery when trailer orders rose to their highest level in nine quarters 
despite the overall improvement in the trailer industry  several of our customers saw their trailer sales decline from the previous year 
this market is expected to show further improvement throughout however  with the continued slow economy and record high fuel costs  the trailer industry s recovery could be weakened 
sales of industrial hardware such as rotary locks  locking recessed handles  multi point paddle handles and slam latches to original equipment manufacturers and distributors were down from this was primarily due to the continued softness in the economy 
sales of school bus door closures increased in as customers came back to our standard door control after moving to a competitor s linear door control design in  whose products resulted in numerous user complaints 
sales of automotive accessories toolbox locks  push button locks and rotary latches rose  the improved demand for our hardware was due to an increase in sales of light trucks that resulted from auto industry promotions 
sales at the company s mexican operations decreased from primarily due to economic conditions in mexico 
despite the slowdown in the economy  the company continued to invest in new products and acquire businesses that complement its existing operations or provide opportunities to enter new markets 
to that end  on october   the company acquired of the outstanding stock of canadian commercial vehicles corporation 
this company  located in kelowna  british columbia  manufactures lightweight sleeper boxes for class trailer trucks 
by using a core composite honeycomb technology in the fabrication process  the company is able to produce extremely lightweight panels in a range of strengths and stiffnesses 
panels with low strength and stiffness are suitable for such low load applications as domestic internal doors  while panels with high strength and stiffness are suitable for such high load applications as aircraft components 
canadian commercial vehicles currently does not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations 
however  the product it produces lends itself to the industrial  transportation and marine industries  markets to which we presently provide locking  latching and other hardware devices 
this acquisition will open opportunities for both eberhard manufacturing and canadian commercial vehicles to sell complete systems such as doors or hatches with the hardware pre installed 
the company intends to invest in the resources necessary to expand canadian commercial vehicles current operations and focus it on additional market areas such as the automotive  recreational vehicle and marine industries 
in addition  this acquisition gives the company an opportunity to introduce its automotive accessory hardware into the class truck market  an area where it has had little presence previously 
in the security products segment  sales were higher than in volume of existing products decreased sales by while new product introductions increased sales by and price increases raised sales by 
sales of locks to the computer industry grew in the increase was primarily caused by the introduction of new computer products requiring locks  which resulted in a gain in market share from competitors 
sales of high security locks for coin operated vending and gaming equipment were up in that increase was primarily the result of our gaining market share from our competition in an otherwise flat or down market 
sales of locks to distributors servicing lower volume accounts increased  while sales to the industrial controls and accessories market decreased slightly 
sales of locks for access doors  furniture  electronics equipment and vehicular applications were down from levels  mainly because of the overall softness in the general economy 
sales of luggage locks for the travel industry declined  sales to this market have been hard hit in the wake of the september terrorist attacks  and they continue to be impacted by the transportation security administration tsa declaration that passengers should not lock their checked baggage on commercial airline flights 
as a result  the ccl security products division has introduced prestosealtm  a device which allows the tsa access to checked luggage and lets the owner of the bag know when someone has opened it 
in march  the company acquired certain assets of the big tag division of dolan enterprises  inc among these assets was a high visibility luggage tag the big tag r which the company is marketing with its prestolock r to the travel and premium markets 
sales of security products to the commercial laundry industry increased from sales of smart card products continued to grow  offsetting any declines that occurred in sales of the company s mature products for the laundry sector 
the growth in smart card product sales was driven by greater acceptance of smart card technology among both existing and new customers 
the successful introduction of our new coin acceptor product also contributed to the higher sales to the laundry industry 
during the year  the company completed its move of the ccl security products division from new britain  connecticut  to wheeling  illinois  where it was combined with the company s illinois lock company division 
in the metal products segment  sales were down from the previous year 
volume accounted for the reduction in sales 
sales of contract castings were down from this decrease was mainly due to the loss of customers who decided to source their contract casting work from china and mexico 
because of lower labor and operating costs in these countries coupled with favorable currency exchange rates  the price of imported castings is often below that of us produced castings 
beginning in the third quarter of  the company began to phase out its low margin contract casting business and concentrate instead on its proprietary mine roof anchor systems 
however  the company will continue to offer contract castings to customers when profit margins are acceptable 
in addition  to maintain utilization rates in its factory  the company has developed capabilities for producing castings from ductile iron previously  it used only malleable iron for its castings business 
the new capabilities will enable the company to supply additional products and services to its customers 
sales of mine roof support anchors decreased from during  demand for these products declined as a result of an unusually warm winter  which caused the demand for electric power to drop for the first time in years 
faced with a lower demand for power  utility companies reduced their use of coal 
management believes coal  however  will remain the backbone of the us energy supply 
known coal reserves are spread over countries and will last years at current production levels 
in contrast  known oil and gas reserves worldwide are expected to last around and years  respectively  at current production levels  of those reserves are in the middle east 
approximately billion tons of coal are mined in the united states each year  and about of that volume is consumed by power companies 
although the demand for coal is influenced by the weather and the price of natural gas and oil  coal is still the least costly and most price stable energy source available today 
the bush administration has placed coal at the forefront of its plans to meet projected us energy demands over the next years 
with new clean coal technologies that can cut emissions of pollutants from power plants by as much as  utility companies have shown a great interest in building more new coal fired plants to meet us energy needs 
already  as many as additional facilities have been proposed throughout the country 
although changes in coal mining technology have caused the number of underground coal mines to decline  there continues to be a need for mine roof support systems 
to more effectively meet this need and to compete with resin bolt systems  we have developed a new mine roof anchor system that provides additional bolting solutions 
total gross margin for decreased  or million  from the decrease resulted from the combination of lower sales and increased costs for workers compensation  insurance and pensions 
the gross margin percentage for was approximately percentage point below the level versus 
total selling and administrative expenses were down  or  from the decrease was due to the elimination of the goodwill amortization expense in as a result of the company s adoption of financial accounting board statement no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
the elimination of this expense item was offset somewhat by increased compensation expenses in interest expense decreased  or  from due to lower interest rates and lower outstanding balances resulting from payments on debt 
earnings before income taxes in decreased  or million  from pretax earnings for the industrial hardware segment rose by  or  this increase was due to higher sales volume and increased utilization of production facilities and sales of new products with higher margins 
the security products segment experienced an increase of  or  in pretax earnings 
this increase was mainly due to an increase in sales volume and increased efficiency resulting from the consolidation of ccl security products into the company s illinois lock company 
in the metal products segment  pretax earnings were down  or million  due to an reduction in sales volume  an under utilization of productive capacity  personnel costs associated with the downsizing of our operation and a significant increase in workers compensation costs  these costs related to both the current year premium and additional costs associated with claims under prior year policies 
the company s prior policies have reached their maximum expense for all but one policy period 
the company expects additional maximum expense related to this one policy period of approximately  to be reached in corporate expenses were  or million more than due to higher personnel expenses in  and the fact that corporate expense included a one time gain before income taxes of  received from prudential financial inc in its issuance of stock during its demutualization to a public company 
the effective tax rate in was  down from in the lower rate for was due to a higher percentage of earnings derived in countries with a lower tax rate 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales for decreased million to million from million for volume of existing products reduced sales by  while new product introductions raised sales by and price increases raised sales by 
the industrial hardware segment experienced an decline in sales 
volume of existing products decreased sales by  while internally developed new products for the utility truck and vehicular accessory markets increased sales by and price increases raised sales 
sales of heavy hardware to the tractor trailer market decreased from levels 
sales to this market began to decline in the latter half of  when truck and trailer manufacturers with excessive inventories started to reduce their purchases 
sales of industrial hardware such as rotary locks  locking recessed handles  multi point paddle handles and slam latches to original equipment manufacturers and distributors were off from this was primarily due to the downturn in the manufacturing sector of the economy 
sales of school bus door closures decreased  and sales of automotive accessories toolbox locks  push button locks and rotary latches declined 
sales at the company s mexican operations decreased from despite the slowdown in the economy  the company continued to invest in new products  including a recently developed electronic bus door control device 
in the security products segment  sales were higher than in price increases raised sales by  and volume increases raised sales 
the volume increases were primarily due to the acquisition of the greenwald businesses  which were added to the security products segment in the third quarter of excluding the effect of greenwald  sales would have been down in sales of locks to the computer industry decreased in the decrease resulted partly from the downturn in the computer industry  and partly from a recent decision by one of our major customers to offer locking mechanisms as an option on new business servers and computers 
sales of high security locks for coin operated vending  gaming and amusement equipment were off in this decline was the direct result of a slowdown in the expansion of casinos and game rooms  and a slowing of commercial development requiring new coin operated vending equipment 
sales of locks to distributors servicing lower volume accounts decreased in also down were sales of locks for access door  furniture  electronics and vehicular applications 
sales of luggage locks for the travel industry declined  fourth quarter sales to this market were especially hard hit 
sales to locksmiths were off in sales of security products to the commercial laundry industry were also affected by the slowdown in the economy 
sales to original equipment manufacturers were off by for the year 
sales to distributors in the commercial laundry industry were comparable to prior year levels  while sales to the route operators in that industry were down slightly 
sales of smart card products to the industry  however  grew by from the prior year due to greater acceptance of smart card technology and an increase in our customer base 
despite the decline in business during  the company continued to invest in research and development in order to introduce new products and technology in the mechanical and smart card product lines 
during  the company introduced a high security push button lock for medical cabinetry applications  and also introduced a new drawer slide product line 
these new products met with a positive response from our local sales representatives and current customers and from trade show attendees 
in the metal products segment  sales were down from the previous year 
volume reduced sales  while price increases raised sales 
sales of contract castings were down from this decrease was mainly due to the loss in of orders we had received from another foundry in when that foundry was temporarily shut down by a fire 
without this temporary contract casting business included in  sales would have been down in the contract casting business continues to be adversely affected by the importation of castings from china and mexico 
because of lower labor costs in these countries and favorable currency exchange rates  the imports are creating pricing pressures in the casting markets 
sales of mine roof support anchors increased from the energy crisis in california and the surge in natural gas prices in and early led to a heightened demand for coal  which in turn led to the reopening of several underground coal mines that used the company s proprietary mine roof anchor support systems 
although the demand for coal is influenced by the weather and the price of natural gas and oil  coal is still the least costly and most price stable energy source available today 
at the same time  mining technology has evolved over the years  with fewer underground mines in operation  there is now less call for mine roof support systems than there was in the past 
to remain competitive as mining techniques have changed  the company has developed alternative products and new manufacturing methods 
a new mine roof anchor system has been developed to more effectively compete with resin bolt systems 
in addition  the company has invested in the equipment and developed the technical knowledge necessary to begin the production of ductile iron 
ductile iron is superior to malleable iron  and is lower in cost to produce 
total gross margin for decreased  or million  from the decrease resulted from the combination of lower sales and under absorbed overhead 
the gross margin percentage for was approximately percentage points below the level versus 
total selling and administrative expenses were up  or  from most of the increase was due to the inclusion of greenwald for the full months of other items that increased included goodwill amortization expenses associated with the acquisitions made in  payroll expenses and advertising expenses 
interest expense increased  or  from this was due to the additional borrowings principally for the greenwald acquisition in that were on the books for the months of earnings before income taxes in decreased  or million  from pretax earnings for the industrial hardware segment sank by  or million 
this decrease was due to lower sales volume and under utilized production facilities 
the security products segment experienced a decrease of  or  in pretax earnings 
this decrease was partially offset by results from the greenwald acquisition  with greenwald excluded  the negative impact would have been greater 
in the metal products segment  pretax earnings were down  or  due to a reduction in contract casting business 
corporate expenses were down  or  as the result of lower compensation expenses and the income received from the prudential demutualization 
the effective tax rate in was  up from in the higher rate for was due to higher foreign taxes associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings through a dividend distribution 
liquidity and sources of capital current ratio average days sales in accounts receivable inventory turnover ratio of working capital to sales total debt to market capitalization total debt to total shareholders equity on december   the company amended its unsecured loan agreement the loan agreement with its lender 
as a result  the term portion of the loan agreement million on december  is to be paid in quarterly principal payments of  during  and the payments are then to increase annually until maturity on january  as required  the company maintains an interest rate swap contract with the lender with an original amount of million  this amount is reduced on a quarterly basis in accordance with the principal repayment schedule of the term portion of the loan agreement million on december  
the interest rate on the swap contract is fixed at 
under the revolving credit portion of the loan agreement  the company may borrow up to million through july   and must pay a quarterly commitment fee of on the unused portion 
as of december   million was outstanding under the revolving credit portion of the loan agreement 
the interest rates on the term and the revolving credit portions of the loan agreement may vary 
for the term portion  the interest rate is based on libor plus additional interest of to 
for the revolving credit portion  the rate is based on libor plus to 
the additional interest percentages are based on operating results calculated on a rolling four quarter basis 
in  the company borrowed million to finance specific building improvements and equipment acquisitions 
the borrowing was structured in the form of a lease classified as a capital lease obligation 
the lease obligation is collateralized by a security interest in the aforementioned equipment and a  letter of credit 
as of december  scheduled annual principal maturities of long term debt  including capital lease obligations  for each of the next five years follow     and  the ratio of working capital to sales was in  in and in the higher ratio in was due to planned increases in inventory levels and an investment in common stock received as compensation from prudential financial in connection with prudential s demutualization in the fourth quarter of accounts receivable were at approximately the same levels at the end of and the average days sales in accounts receivable equaled in compared with days in and days in the company continues to focus on improvement and collection of accounts receivable 
inventories decreased in by  or million  from the decrease reflected a planned reduction at frazer jones resulting from a decline in contract casting customers  it also was due to the stocking of additional inventory in for ccl s move from new britain  ct  to wheeling  il 
inventory turnover remained substantially unchanged at times in versus times in and times in inventories at some locations are slightly higher than required  and the company continues to focus on reducing levels in order to free up working capital 
capital expenditures in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
the company continuously upgrades and replaces existing equipment to expand capacity  improve efficiency and satisfy safety and environmental requirements 
the company expects capital expenditures for will be approximately million to million 
the company s leases certain equipment and buildings under cancelable and non cancelable operating leases expiring at various dates up to ten years 
rent expense amounted to  in   in and  in cash flow generated from operations in was million  which was more than sufficient to service our term loan  pay dividends  fund capital expenditures  pay down million on our revolving credit loan and internally finance two small business acquisitions 
the present financial strength of the company s balance sheet demonstrated by a current ratio of to  positive cash flow from operating activities and availability of a million credit line will enable the company to meet its current obligations and continue to grow in impact of inflation and changing prices the impact of inflation on the company s operations has not been significant  as the company has generally been able to adjust its prices to reflect higher manufacturing costs  or has been able to improve its manufacturing processes to achieve increased productivity 
historical data as presented in the financial statements reasonably relate current costs  except for depreciation  to revenues generated in the period 
depreciation expense based on the current replacement cost of plant and equipment would be higher than depreciation expense reported in historical financial statements 
the company uses the last in  first out lifo method of accounting for its domestic inventories and the first in  first out fifo method for all other inventories 
under the lifo method  the cost of products sold reported in the financial statements approximates current cost and thus provides a closer matching of revenue and expenses in periods of increasing costs 
other matters critical accounting policies the preparation of the financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make judgments  estimates and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
areas of uncertainty that require judgments  estimates and assumptions include the accounting for derivatives  environmental matters  the testing of goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment  proceeds on assets to be sold  pensions and other postretirement benefits  and tax matters 
management uses historical experience and all available information to make its estimates and assumptions  and actual results will inevitably differ from the estimates and assumptions that are used to prepare the company s financial statements at any given time 
despite these inherent limitations  management believes that management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the financial statements and related footnotes provide a meaningful and fair picture of the company 
management believes that the application of these estimates and assumptions on a consistent basis enables the company to provide the users of the financial statements with useful and reliable information about the company s operating results and financial condition 
allowance for doubtful accounts we continuously monitor payments from our customers and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts  that is  for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
when we evaluate the adequacy of our allowances for doubtful accounts  we take into account various factors including our accounts receivable aging  customer creditworthiness  historical bad debts and geographic risk 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances might be required 
inventory reserve inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  generally determined by the last in  first out lifo method 
accordingly  a lifo valuation reserve is calculated using the link chain method and is maintained to properly value these inventories 
we review the net realizable value of inventory in detail on an ongoing basis  giving consideration to deterioration  obsolescence and other factors 
based on these assessments  we provide for an inventory reserve in the period in which an impairment is identified 
the reserve fluctuates with market conditions  design cycles and other economic factors 
goodwill and intangible assets intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized generally on a straight line basis over the periods benefited 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized 
prior to  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets were amortized over periods ranging from to years 
each year during the second quarter  the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives is tested for impairment 
during  the company used the discounted cash flow method to calculate the fair value of its reporting units with goodwill 
if it is determined that the carrying value exceeds fair value  an impairment loss is recognized at that time 
the determination of discounted cash flows is based on the businesses strategic plans and long range planning forecasts 
the revenue growth rates included in the plans are management s best estimates based on current and forecasted market conditions  and profit margin assumptions are projected by each segment based on the current cost structure and anticipated cost reductions 
if different assumptions were used in these plans  the related undiscounted cash flows used in measuring impairment could be different and additional impairment of assets might be required to be recorded 
pension and other postretirement benefits the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are assumptions about such factors as expected return on plan assets  discount rates at which liabilities could be settled  rate of increase in future compensation levels  mortality rates and trends in health insurance costs 
these assumptions are reviewed annually and updated as required 
in accordance with gaap  actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  affect the expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods 
the expected long term rate of return on assets is developed with input from the company s actuarial firms 
also considered is the company s historical experience with pension fund asset performance in comparison with expected returns 
the long term rate of return assumption used for determining net periodic pension expense for was 
the company reviews the long term rate of return each year 
raising or lowering the expected long term rate of return by would impact pension expense by approximately  future actual pension income and expense will depend on future investment performance  changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the population of participants in the company s pension plans 
the recent declines in equity markets and interest rates have had a negative impact on the company s pension plan liability and the fair value of its plan assets 
as a result  the accumulated benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of plan assets at the end of for two of the company s plans  which resulted in a million charge to shareholders equity in the fourth quarter 
the company expects to make cash contributions to its pension plans of approximately million in item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s foreign manufacturing facilities account for approximately of total sales and of total assets 
its us operations buy from and sell to these foreign affiliates  and also make limited sales less than of total sales to nonaffiliated foreign customers 
this trade activity could be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange or by weak economic conditions 
the company s currency exposure is concentrated in the canadian dollar  mexican peso  new taiwan dollar and hong kong dollar 
because of the company s limited exposure to foreign markets  any currency exchange gains or losses have not been material and are not expected to be material 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk with respect to its unsecured loan agreement  which provides for interest based on libor plus a spread of up to 
the spread is determined by a comparison of the company s operating performance with agreed upon financial targets 
since the company s performance depends to a large extent on the overall economy  the interest rate paid by the company under its loan agreement is closely linked to the trend in the us economy 
the current interest rate spread is on the term loan portion and on the revolving credit line portion of the loan agreement 
changes in libor rates will also affect the company s interest expense 
to hedge against future libor rate increases  the company has a swap contract on part of the term loan portion of the loan agreement 
the interest rate on the contract is 
the notional amount of the swap contract is reduced on a quarterly basis in accordance with the principal repayment schedule for the term portion of the loan agreement 
the notional amount of the swap contract was million as of december  the remainder of the term debt is subject to the volatility of short term interest rates  where a change in interest rates would cause an  increase or decrease in the company s annual interest cost 
while the company could enter into an additional swap agreement to fix the rate  it does not expect to do so
