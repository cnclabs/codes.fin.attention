all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated 
the company currently has two aggregated operating divisions known as the oregon steel division and the rmsm division 
see note to the consolidated financial statements on discussion of the company s aggregate reporting of its operating units 
the oregon steel division is centered at the portland mill 
in addition to the portland mill  the oregon steel division includes the napa pipe mill and the camrose pipe mill

during and  the portland mill was the beneficiary of a committed power supply contract with a local utility company 
under the contract the utility guaranteed to supply an amount of electricity to the mill at a fixed rate 
during the west coast electricity shortage in and  the company agreed not to use a daily determined portion of the guaranteed supply and was compensated by the local utility at a daily determined rate per megawatt hour 
the revenue from this was included in operating income because the company made an operational choice to not use power in return for compensation rather than to produce product 
there was no direct cost of sales associated with this transaction and  accordingly  the net revenue compensation in excess of contracted price fully impacted operating income for the period 
the company s long range strategic plan emphasizes the commitment to increase the company s offering of specialty products  particularly in the plate  rail  rod and welded pipe businesses  while seeking to reduce the impact of individual product cycles on the company s financial performance 
to achieve these goals  the company is developing additional product offerings and extending its market from the western united states to a national marketing presence 
the company s operating results were positively affected in by  among other things  increased demand for welded pipe products 
however  increased pricing pressure in plate products continued in the specialty and commodity plate markets have been impacted by both new sources of domestic supply and continued imports from foreign suppliers  which have adversely affected average selling prices for the company s plate products 
high fixed costs motivate steel producers to maintain high output levels even in the face of falling prices  thereby increasing further downward pressures on selling prices 
the domestic steel industry and the company s business are highly cyclical in nature and these factors have adversely affected the profitability of the company 
on march   president bush announced the imposition of restrictions on a wide range of steel imports for three years  including a tariff on steel plate and hot rolled coil and a tariff on imports of steel slabs in excess of million tons in year one 
the tariffs on steel plate  coil  and slabs decline to in year two and in year three 
the tariffs for steel slabs are for imports in excess of million tons in year two and million tons in year three 
imports from mexico  a large exporter of slab to the us  and canada and certain developing countries are exempted from these restrictions 
this action is expected to reduce the supply of certain steel products available on the us market  thereby increasing the prices domestic steel manufacturers can charge for those products 
these restrictions did not materially impact either the supply or the cost of steel slabs which the company purchases on the open market to process into steel plate and coil 
the company expects to ship approximately million tons of product during the oregon steel division anticipates that it will ship approximately  tons of welded pipe and approximately  tons of plate and coil products during the product mix is expected to shift in terms of tons  from of welded pipe and of plate and coil in  to approximately and  respectively in this shift in product mix is expected to have a material negative impact on the average sales price and operating income for the division 
the rmsm division anticipates that it will ship approximately  tons of rail  and approximately  tons of rod and bar products 
seamless pipe shipments will be dependent on market conditions in the drilling industry 
while the company anticipates that product category average selling prices will be similar in as in  higher raw material and energy costs are expected to have a negative impact on the operating income for the division 
accordingly  the company expects consolidated operating income to be significantly lower in versus however  the company expects liquidity to remain adequate through unless there is a substantial negative change in overall economic markets 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates 
this includes allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
this provides a basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  and these differences may be material 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
as of december   the allowance of doubtful accounts was approximately million 
in establishing a proper allowance for doubtful accounts  the company evaluates the collectibility of its accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in cases where management is aware of the circumstances that may impair a specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligations  the company records a specific allowance against amounts due from customers  and thereby reduces the net recognized receivable amount the company reasonably believes will be collected 
for all other customers  the company evaluates the allowance for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due  historical collection experience  customer credit worthiness and economic trends 
inventory 
the company s inventory consists of raw materials  semi finished  finished products and operating stores and supplies 
at december   inventory was approximately million 
if appropriate  the company s inventory balances are adjusted to approximate the lower of manufacturing cost or market value 
no such adjustment was required in manufacturing cost is determined using the average cost method 
environmental liabilities 
all material environmental remediation liabilities for non capital expenditures  which are both probable and estimable  are recorded in the financial statements based on current technologies and current environmental standards at the time of evaluation 
adjustments are made when additional information is available that suggests different remediation methods or when estimated time periods are changed  thereby affecting the total cost 
the best estimate of the probable cost within a range is recorded  however  if there is no best estimate  the low end of the range is recorded and the range is disclosed 
even though the company has established certain reserves for environmental remediation  additional remedial measures may be required by environmental authorities and additional environmental hazards  necessitating further remedial expenditures  may be asserted by these authorities or private parties 
accordingly  the costs of remedial measures may exceed the amounts reserved 
litigation liabilities 
all material litigation liabilities  which are both probable and estimable  are recorded in the financial statements based on the nature of the litigation  progress of the case  and opinions of management and legal counsel on the outcome 
adjustments are made when additional information is available that alters opinions of management and legal counsel on the outcome of the litigation 
the best estimate of the probable cost within a range is recorded  however  if there is no best estimate  the low end of the range is recorded and the range is disclosed 
employee benefits plans and other post retirement benefits 
annual pension and other post retirement benefits oprb expenses are calculated by third party actuaries using standard actuarial methodologies 
the actuaries assist the company in making estimates based on historical information  current information and estimates about future events and circumstances 
significant assumptions used in the valuation of pension and oprb include expected return on plan assets  discount rate  rate of increase in compensation levels and the health care cost trend rate 
the company accounts for the defined benefit pension plans using statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employer s accounting for pensions sfas no 

as a result of continuing declines in interest rates and the market value of the company s defined benefit pension plans assets  the company was required to increase the minimum pension liability at december  by million 
this adjustment did not impact current earnings 
for further details regarding the company s benefits and post retirement plans  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
deferred taxes 
deferred income taxes reflect the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities at year end based on enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates 
tax credits are recognized as a reduction of income tax expense in the year the credit arises 
a valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount more likely than not to be realized

for  the division shipped  tons of plate  coil and welded pipe products  compared to  tons in this increase was due to significantly higher shipments of welded pipe resulting from the supply of more than  tons of large diameter pipe to kern river gas transmission company  for its kern river expansion project 
average selling price per ton increased in to from in the prior year 
the increase was mainly due to a shift in product mix towards higher priced welded pipe products attributable to the kern river expansion project pipe order 
rmsm division 
for  the division shipped  tons  compared to  tons in the increase was due to higher shipments of rail products  partially offset by decreased rod and bar shipments  as well as decreased seamless pipe and semi finished products 
average product selling price per ton increased to in from in the shift of product mix to rail in was the principal reason for the improved pricing 
in addition  the demand for seamless pipe remained sluggish throughout  and as a result  the seamless mill was temporarily shut down for the periods from november to april and from mid august to mid september of gross profits 
gross profit was million  or of sales  for compared to million  or of sales  for the increase of million in gross profit was positively impacted by increased sales of high priced welded pipe from the napa pipe mill  and increased sales of rail products and higher rod and bar prices at the rmsm division 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a of million for decreased by  from million for sg a expenses decreased as a percentage of total sales to in from in the decrease was due to higher general adminstrative costs in  including such non recurring items as million of seamless pipe commission fees and million of environmental and other legal expenses reserves

freight revenue increased in response to product sales growth  as well as the product mix and customer preference on shipping 
oregon steel division 
for  the division shipped  tons of plate  coil and welded pipe products  compared to  tons in this decrease was due to a weakness in market demand and also due  in large part  to the day temporary curtailment at the portland mill during august of this curtailment was in response to the plate market decline 
despite the decline in total shipments  average selling price per ton  net of revenues from the electricity sales and shipping revenues  increased in to from in the prior year 
the increase was in large part due to greater mix of higher priced welded pipe products attributable to the increased pipe orders at the napa pipe mill 
also included in sales is million in electricity sales 
the company sold approximately of excess power load in its melting facility at the portland mill back to the local utility under an electricity exchange contract  which expired in october rmsm division 
for  the division shipped  tons  compared to  tons in the increase was due to higher shipments of seamless pipe and rod and bar products  partially offset by decreased rail shipments caused by capital program reductions by the major railroads 
average product selling price per ton increased to in from in the shift of product mix to seamless pipe in was the principal reason for the improved pricing  as seamless pipe has the highest selling price per ton of all the division s products 
due to the adverse market conditions in the prior year  no seamless products were shipped during the first nine months of because the operation was temporarily shut down 
while performance of seamless products for the first half of was strong  market conditions again deteriorated as demand from oil and gas distributors decreased toward the second half of the year  due to significant decline of oil and natural gas prices

also included in sales is million in electricity sales 
gross profits 
gross profit was million  or  for compared to million  or  for the increase of million in gross profit was primarily related to the increased sales of high priced welded pipe and seamless pipe products 
additionally  the sale of electricity positively impacted gross profit margin 
this increase in gross profit was partially offset by continued manufacturing overhead costs at the portland mill that did not decline with the lower melt shop production that occurred as a result of the sale of electricity back to the local utility

selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a of million for increased by  from million for sg a expenses increased as a percentage of total sales to in from in the increase was due in part to million in additional seamless pipe commission fees for  as compared to commission fees paid in when the seamless mill was shut down for the majority of that year 
in addition  shipping costs increased  from million in to million in this was a direct result of higher volume of shipments on welded and seamless pipe in the remaining increase from the prior year was due to higher general and administrative costs 
this included an increase in bad debt expense of million and an increase in reserves for environmental and other legal expenses of million 
interest expense 
total interest expense increased  or  to million in  compared to million in the increase in interest expense in was primarily due to the acceleration of amortized loan fees  additional loan fees  and higher interest costs associated with the amendment of the company s credit facility in the third and fourth quarters of income tax expense

an offset to the increase in current assets was decreases in accounts receivable and deferred tax asset million and million  respectively 
the accounts receivable for the year ended december   as measured in average daily sales outstanding  decreased to days  as compared to days for the year ended december  the decrease was attributable to a faster turnover of welded pipe and rail product receivables from customers paying earlier in order to utilize cash discounts  and an increased effort on collec tions of receivables 
the decrease in current liabilities was primarily due to a million decrease in short term borrowings from the company s credit facility which was paid off with the proceeds of the notes 
in addition  the company made a series of payments totaling million to complete the payoff of the year cf i acquisition term loan of million  incurred by cf i as part of the purchase price of certain assets of cf i steel corporation on march as of december   principal payments on debt are due as follows in thousands on july  the company issued million of notes in a private offering at a discount of and an interest rate of

despite the unfavorable net results for  caused by a million non cash goodwill impairment charge required under the new accounting provision of fas  the company has been able to satisfy its needs for working capital and capital expenditures through operating income and  in part  through its ability to secure adequate financing arrangements 
the company believes that its anticipated needs for working capital and capital expenditures for the next twelve months will be met from funds generated from operations  and if necessary  from the available credit facility 
the company s level of indebtedness presents other risks to investors  including the possibility that the company and its subsidiaries may be unable to generate cash sufficient to pay the principal of and interest on their indebtedness when due 
in that event  the holders of the indebtedness may be able to declare all indebtedness owing to them to be due and payable immediately  and to proceed against their collateral  if applicable 
these actions would likely have a material adverse effect on the company 
in addition  the company faces potential costs and liabilities associated with environmental compliance and remediation issues and the labor dispute at the pueblo mill  as well as the potential shutdown of the melt shop at the portland mill 
see business environmental matters  business labor matters and business raw material and semi finished slabs for a description of those matters 
any costs or liabilities in excess of those expected by the company could have a material adverse effect on the company
