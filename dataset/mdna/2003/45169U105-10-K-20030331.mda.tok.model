item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview igate corporation  formerly named igate capital corporation  through its operating subsidiaries  is a worldwide provider of it and offshore outsourcing services to large and medium sized organizations 
from inception and through february  we conducted the majority of our business under the name of mastech corporation through our wholly owned subsidiary mastech systems corporation  a pennsylvania corporation that was formed in july in march  we transferred substantially all of the assets of mastech systems corporation to subsidiary operating companies 
this reorganization was done to enable us to identify and penetrate emerging it markets quickly and effectively 
in addition  this strategy enabled us to expand our existing portfolio of services as well as to create new service offerings 
we also acquired majority interests or made strategic investments in a number of companies in the internet related services market sector 
our operating subsidiaries provide clients with a source for a broad range of it applications solutions and offshore outsourcing service including client server design and development  conversion migration services  erp package implementation and integration services  software development and applications maintenance outsourcing 
the companies in the it staffing segment earn a substantial portion of their revenues on a time and materials basis as services are performed 
companies in the offshore outsourcing and enterprise applications segments recognize revenues on both a time and materials and proportional performance basis 
critical accounting policies the following explains our most significant accounting policies 
see note to the consolidated financial statements set forth on pages of the form k for a complete description of our significant accounting policies 
use of estimates in the preparation of financial statements the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
all of the estimates that we make in preparing our financial statements are in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
actual results could differ from our estimates  which could impact our earnings 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue on time and materials contracts as the services are performed 
time and materials contracts typically bill at an agreed upon hourly rate 
we also have fixed price arrangements with certain customers 
a price for an entire project is agreed upon before the project starts for a predetermined fee 
we recognize revenues on fixed price contracts using the proportional performance method 
we prepare a budget for each fixed price project  and based upon the budget that we prepare  we estimate what our costs should be 
we determine performance by comparing the actual cost of work performed to date to the estimated total cost for each contract 
if our estimates indicate a loss on a particular fixed price contract  we record a provision for the estimated loss without regard to the stage of completion 
changes in job performance  conditions and estimated profitability may result in revisions to costs and revenues and are recognized in the period in which the changes are identified 
accounts receivable we extend credit to clients based upon management s assessment of their creditworthiness 
substantially all of our revenues and the resulting accounts receivable are from fortune companies  major systems integrators and governmental agencies 
unbilled receivables represent amounts recognized as revenues for the periods presented based on services performed in accordance with the terms of client contracts that will be invoiced in subsequent periods 
allowance for uncollectible accounts we review accounts receivable periodically to determine the probability of loss 
the allowance for uncollectible accounts is determined using the combination of the specific identification method for balances deemed uncollectible  as well as judgments made by us based upon historical and expected charge off experience 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates or if economic conditions worsen  additional allowances may be necessary  which may impact earnings 
investments investments in money market funds are stated at cost  which approximates fair value 
investments in marketable equity securities are accounted for in accordance with statements of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas 
we have determined that certain of our investments in marketable equity securities are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value  utilizing the investments closing price at each reporting period 
these investments are recorded on the balance sheet at market value  with the unrealized gains or losses  net of tax  reported as a component of comprehensive loss in the consolidated statement of shareholders equity and comprehensive loss 
the unrealized gain or loss is the difference between our original cost for an investment and the investment s fair value at each reporting period 
realized gains or losses on securities sold are calculated using the specific identification method 
if management determines that an investment in available for sale securities has sustained an other than temporary decline in its value  the investment is written down to its fair value  by a charge to earnings 
such evaluation is dependent on the specific facts and circumstances 
factors that are considered by us in determining whether an other than temporary decline in value has occurred include the market value of the security in relation to its cost basis  the financial condition of the investee  and the intent and ability to retain the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery in the market value of the investment 
in evaluating these factors  management presumes a decline in value to be other than temporary if the market price of the security is or more below the investment s cost basis for a period of six months or more the criteria 
however  the presumption of an other than temporary decline in these instances may be overcome if there is persuasive evidence indicating that the decline is temporary in nature eg  strong operating performance of investee  historical volatility of investee  etc additionally  there may be instances where impairment losses are recognized even if the criteria is not satisfied eg  plan to sell the security in the near term and the fair value is below our cost basis 
during  we incurred impairment losses deemed to be other than temporary 
these impairments are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we account for investments in businesses in which we own between and of equity or otherwise acquire management influence using the equity method as prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
investments in which we acquire less than a interest  or in which we do not acquire management influence are accounted for using the cost method of accounting or  if publicly traded  as available for sale securities 
for investments accounted for using the cost or equity method of accounting  management evaluates information eg  budgets  business plans  financial statements  etc 
in addition to quoted market price  if any  in determining whether an other than temporary decline in value exists 
factors indicative of an other than temporary decline include recurring operating losses  credit defaults and subsequent rounds of financings at an amount below the cost basis of an investment 
this list is not all inclusive and management weighs all quantitative factors in determining if an other than temporary decline in value of an investment has occurred 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill is the excess of purchase price over the value of the net assets acquired 
in january  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
under sfas  goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
estimated fair values of reporting units underlying the segments were estimated using either a discounted cash flow methodology  recent comparable transactions or a combination thereof 
for further discussions  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation at december   we had seven stock based employee compensation plans  which are described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas gives companies the option to adopt the fair value method for expense recognition of employee stock options or to continue to account for employee stock options using the intrinsic value method  as outlined under accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
we have elected to continue to apply the intrinsic value method to account for employee stock options and discloses the pro forma effect as if the fair value method had been applied in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following table illustrates the effect on net loss per share if we had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas to stock based employee compensation year ended december  in thousands  except per share amounts net loss  as reported less total stock based employee compensation expense determined under fair value method for all awards pro forma net loss earnings per share basic and diluted as reported pro forma compared to the following tables present selected financial information for the company s reporting segments for the years ended december  and the following comparisons include billable expenses as part of external revenues in accordance with eitf issue no

economic trends the economic downturn that we have experienced over the last year has resulted in a revenue decline of million  a decrease from the prior year 
we attribute this revenue decline to several factors 
first  lower demand for outside services 
our clients  concerned by their own cost structure  are accomplishing their it needs with their own internal resources 
second  our clients tight it budgets and focus on projects with high roi return on investment resulted in fewer and smaller projects 
third  increased competition from both it services and software companies drove pricing down 
pricing pressure was felt across all geographies and industry sectors 
our solutions offerings are purchased as value added projects by customers and in times of economic slowdown  are the types of projects that are the first to be delayed or cancelled 
our odc facilities are located in india  and as part of the sales process  we encourage potential customers to visit our odc facilities and we believe the political unrest in the asia pacific region has slowed traveling abroad considerably

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk on june   we entered into a foreign exchange contract with pnc to hedge our foreign exchange exposure on certain intercompany debt

we liquidated the contract at or us million 
short term investments are invested in highly liquid securities such as money market funds and certain corporate bonds with maturities of one year or less  and marketable equity securities 
these securities are generally classified as available for sale and consequently  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax 
part of this portfolio includes minority equity investments in several publicly traded companies  the values of which are subject to market price volatility 
as a result of market price volatility of our publicly traded equity investments  we experienced a million decrease in net unrealized gains during fiscal on these investments 
we have also invested in one privately held company airweb  which can still be considered in the startup or development stage 
this type of investment is inherently risky as the market for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize 
we could lose our entire initial investment in this company 
during the year ended december  we recognized an impairment loss of million related to our investment in airweb 
the following analysis presents the hypothetical changes in fair values of public equity investments that are sensitive to changes in the stock market in millions valuation of securities given x decrease in each stock price fair value as of december  valuation of securities given x increase in each stock price corporate equities these equity securities are held for purposes other than trading 
the model technique used measures the hypothetical change in fair values arising from selected hypothetical changes in each stock s price 
stock price fluctuations of plus or minus   and were selected based on the probability of their occurrence 
the company s cash flow and earnings are subject to fluctuations due to exchange rate variation 
foreign currency risk exists by nature of the company s global operations 
the company sells its services in a number of locations around the world  and hence foreign currency risk is diversified 
when appropriate  the company may attempt to limit its exposure to changing foreign exchange rates through both operational and financial market actions 
these actions may include entering into forward contracts to hedge existing exposures 
the instrument is used to reduce risk by essentially creating offsetting currency exposure 
substantially all of the company s foreign affiliates financial instruments are denominated in their respective functional currencies 
accordingly  exposure to exchange risk on foreign currency financial instruments is not material
