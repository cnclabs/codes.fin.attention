overview we design  develop  manufacture and sell medical and dental devices 
our core business is in our bipolar electrosurgical generators and related instrumentation  based on our dualwave tm technology 
our bipolar systems allow a surgeon or dentist to cut tissue in a manner that minimizes collateral damage to surrounding healthy tissue and to coagulate blood vessels quickly  safely and efficiently 
by substantially reducing damage to surrounding healthy tissue  the surgeon or dentist can work safely in close proximity with nerves  blood vessels  bone and metal implants 
our bipolar systems are designed to replace other surgical tools  such as monopolar electrosurgery systems  lasers and conventional instruments  used in soft tissue surgery 
our dualwave tm technology is applicable to many surgical markets 
our bipolar systems are currently used to perform many types of neurosurgery  spine surgery and dental surgery 
we have had worldwide exclusive distribution agreements with codman shurtleff  inc  a subsidiary of johnson johnson  inc  to market our neurosurgery bipolar systems since the term for our current distribution agreement with codman shurtleff  inc was recently extended from december  to march  to allow the parties time to continue to discuss the terms of a new distribution agreement 
historically  we have derived a significant portion of our sales from our neurosurgery bipolar system 
sales revenue from our bident r bipolar tissue management system for dental applications commenced in the fiscal year 
our current strategy is to increase sales of our bident r bipolar tissue management system by selling it directly to an expanded base of national dental product dealers  expand the offerings of products in the field of neurosurgery and broaden the market for our products in other clinical and surgical markets that have a need for bipolar electrosurgery 
our strategy also includes using our dualwave tm technology and sales of our bipolar generators to drive sales of complementary disposable hand held instruments and products 
critical accounting policies and estimates the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as disclosures included elsewhere in this form k  are based upon our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingencies 
on an on going basis  we evaluate the estimates used  including those related to product returns  bad debts  inventory valuation  impairments of tangible and intangible assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  other accruals  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources as well as identifying and assessing our accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we provide for the estimated cost of product returns based upon historical experience and any known conditions or circumstances 
our warranty obligation is affected primarily by product that does not meet specifications and performance requirements within the applicable warranty period and any related costs of addressing such matters 
should actual incidences of product not meeting specifications and performance requirements differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required 
we value inventory at the lower of cost or market and write down the value of inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory 
an inventory reserve is maintained based upon historical data of actual inventory written off and for known conditions and circumstances 
should actual product marketability be affected by conditions that are different from those projected by management  revisions to the estimated inventory reserve may be required 
our deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax based assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance at the time that a determination can be made that it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the related tax assets will not be realized

results of operations summary sales of  for fiscal were less than sales of  for fiscal and less than sales of  for fiscal operating income was  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal net income for fiscal was  as compared to  for fiscal and  for fiscal revenues sales of  in fiscal reflect a decrease in sales volume to codman shurtleff  inc  the distributor of our products in the neurosurgery market  and a decrease in sales of our bident r dental products 
in fiscal  codman shurtleff  inc accounted for of our sales  as compared to of sales for fiscal and of our sales for fiscal sales of the bident r bipolar tissue management system for dental applications were of total sales for fiscal as compared to of sales for fiscal and of our sales for fiscal sales of our neurosurgical products to codman shurtleff  inc decreased by  in fiscal this was primarily due to reduced sales of generators in anticipation of the release of a new neurosurgical generator and instrumentation in sales volume of our disposable cord tubing sets in fiscal increased compared to sales volume in fiscal we recently extended the term of our distribution agreement with codman shurtleff  inc from december  to march  under the same terms as are currently in place in order to provide more time to continue discussions on the terms of a new distribution agreement for both our existing products and other products and disposable instruments  which are or will be ready for introduction into the market 
in addition to the new irrigation unit and related disposable tubing sets  which began production after the end of the fiscal year  we anticipate completing a new neurosurgical generator and disposable instrumentation in the first six months of calendar in the second quarter of fiscal  we implemented a new marketing plan for our bident r bipolar tissue management system for dental applications focusing on direct marketing and sales to national dental product dealers 
these dental product dealers then sell our products to dentists  oral surgeons and periodontists 
during the fiscal year  our marketing efforts included demonstrating our dental products at numerous dental trade shows  sponsoring training seminars and advertising our dental products in leading trade journals 
in addition  with a new dental product manager  which we hired in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we are expanding our marketing efforts with the key dental product distributors 
in the first quarter of and beyond  we anticipate seeing a greater contribution from the sales of our dental products as the leads we are receiving turn to sales 
in fiscal  of our sales related to sales of bipolar electrosurgical generators  irrigators and accessories as compared to approximately and of our sales in fiscal and  respectively 
sales of disposable products accounted for approximately  or of our sales  in fiscal as compared to approximately  or of our sales  in fiscal and approximately  or of our sales  in fiscal the increased sales levels of disposable products reflect increased sales of neurosurgery disposable tubing sets 
cost of product sales cost of sales for fiscal was  or of sales  compared with  or of sales  for fiscal during fiscal  cost of sales was  or of sales 
gross margin was for fiscal as compared to for fiscal and for fiscal the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of sales is primarily attributable to decreased sales volume and an increase in our inventory obsolescence provisions 
we cannot be sure that gross margins will remain at current levels or show improvement in the future due to the distribution channels used  product mix  and fluctuation in manufacturing production levels and overhead costs as new products are introduced 
in addition  inefficiencies in manufacturing new products and the distribution channels utilized to sell those products may adversely impact gross margin 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased slightly to  or of sales  in fiscal  from  or of sales  in fiscal  and from  or of sales  in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses reflect increased selling and marketing expenses incurred in connection with implementing the sales and marketing plan  which we commenced in fiscal  for the bident r bipolar tissue management system 
research and development expenses were  or of sales  in fiscal   or of sales  in fiscal  and  or of sales  in fiscal we will continue to invest in research and development to expand our technological base for use in both existing and additional clinical areas 
the increase was primarily related to our reaching the final stages of development of our new surgical irrigator system and increased resources directed towards the development of a new generator and instrumentation for neurosurgery 
during the year  we also expended additional funds to reach the final stages of development for a product outside of the neurosurgery and dental markets pursuant to a development agreement we entered into with stryker corporation in september after the end of our fiscal year  we extended the term of that development agreement until february  other income and expense  net other income and expense  net  decreased for fiscal to  from  for fiscal and from  for fiscal due primarily to lower interest rates on the short term investments for our cash balances and the write down of certain molding equipment to its estimated fair value 
at the end of fiscal  we had  in cash and cash equivalents as compared to  at the end of fiscal and  at the end of fiscal income tax provision the provision for income taxes was  for fiscal as compared to  for fiscal and  for fiscal our effective tax rate in fiscal was approximately as compared to approximately in fiscal and approximately in fiscal net income net income decreased to  for fiscal  as compared to net income of  for fiscal  and net income of  for fiscal basic and diluted income per share was for fiscal as compared to basic and diluted income per share of 
for fiscal and 
for fiscal although we have been profitable on a quarterly basis since the third quarter of fiscal  we cannot be sure that we can sustain profitability or achieve revenue growth 
liquidity and capital resources at the end of fiscal  we had  in working capital compared to  at the end of fiscal and  at the end of fiscal the primary measures of our liquidity are cash  cash equivalents  accounts receivable and inventory balances  as well as our borrowing ability 
the cash equivalents are highly liquid with original maturities of ninety days or less 
cash used by operating activities was  for fiscal as compared to  generated in fiscal the cash used by operating activities was mainly attributable to increases in prepaid items of  and accounts receivable of  and a decrease in accounts payable and other expenses of  offset by operating profits net of adjustments for non cash items and a decrease in inventory of  in fiscal  accounts receivable net of allowances increased by  to a total of  at the end of fiscal the increase in accounts receivable was principally due to the timing of shipments 
in fiscal  inventories decreased by  to a total of  at the end of fiscal compared to  at the end of fiscal the decrease was primarily due to improved inventory management and reduced sales levels for fiscal inventories were kept at these levels primarily to support anticipated future sales activity 
in fiscal  we received net proceeds of  from the repayment of employee loans 
we also used  for the purchase of equipment and intangible assets used in connection with the sale and marketing of the bident r dental products and in connection with our manufacturing operations 
net property and equipment increased to  at the end of fiscal as compared to  for fiscal in august  our board of directors terminated our then existing stock repurchase plan and authorized a new repurchase plan to purchase up to  shares of our common stock 
cash used for financing activities was  in fiscal as a result of the repurchase of  shares of our common stock in fiscal pursuant to the stock repurchase plan 
all  shares of common stock repurchased were retired or were in the process of being retired as of september  to date  we have repurchased  shares of our common stock under the plan  leaving a balance of  that are available for repurchase under the plan 
at september   we had cash and cash equivalents of  we plan to finance our operating and capital needs principally with cash flows from operations and existing balances of cash and cash equivalents  which we believe will be sufficient to fund our operations in the near future 
however  should it be necessary  we believe we could borrow adequate funds at competitive rates and terms 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the funds we expend in marketing  selling and distributing our products  the success in commercializing our existing products  development and commercialization of products in other clinical markets  the ability of our suppliers to continue to meet our demands at current prices  the status of regulatory approvals and competition 
we have a line of credit of  with wachovia bank  na which calls for interest to be charged at the bank s national commercial rate 
the credit accommodation is unsecured and requires us to have a tangible net worth of no less than  our current tangible net worth exceeds  at september  there was no outstanding balance on this line 
non audit services performed by external auditors pursuant to section a i of the securities exchange act of  as added by section of the sarbanes oxley act of  we are responsible for disclosing to investors the non audit services approved by our audit committee to be performed by samuel klein and company  our external auditor 
non audit services are defined in the law as services other than those provided in connection with an audit or a review of the financial statements of the company 
during the period covered by this filing  our audit committee approved non audit tax compliance services in connection with the preparation of our tax returns  which subsequently were or are being performed by samuel klein and company 
additional cautionary statements we face intense competition the markets for our current and potential products are intensely competitive 
some surgical procedures which utilize or could utilize our products could potentially be replaced or reduced in importance by products sold by other companies or alternative medical procedures or new drugs which could render our products obsolete or uncompetitive in the markets which we sell  or in the future may sell  our products 
we are dependent upon sales of our neurosurgery system almost all of our business in fiscal comes from one customer codman shurtleff  inc  which sells our products in the neurosurgery market  accounted for of our sales in fiscal  and and of our sales in fiscal and  respectively 
any cancellation  deferral or significant reduction in sales in the neurosurgery market could seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the term or our current distribution agreement with codman shurtleff  inc was recently extended from december  to march  to allow the parties time to continue to discuss the terms of a new distribution agreement 
increased sales in the neurosurgery market are dependent on the acceptance of our new neurosurgical generators and disposable hand held instruments in the marketplace 
commercial success of our non neurosurgical products is uncertain our growth depends on the acceptance of our products in the marketplace  the market penetration achieved by the companies that we utilize  sell to  and rely on  to sell and distribute our products  and our ability to introduce new and innovative products that meet the needs of medical professionals 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to introduce new and innovative products or that the products we introduce  or have introduced  will be widely accepted  or continue to be accepted  in the marketplace  or that we or companies  which we may contract with to distribute or sell our products  achieve market penetration 
while we have developed several applications for our dualwave technology outside of neurosurgery and we believe that the products based on our technology offer advantages over other products  we cannot assure you that these advantages will be realized  or if realized  that these products will result in any meaningful benefits to physicians or patients 
we have limited marketing and sales experience we currently have limited experience in marketing and selling our products 
to the extent that we have established or will enter into distribution arrangements for the sale of our products  we are and will be dependent upon the efforts of third parties 
we have entered into a distribution agreement with codman shurtleff  inc to sell our products in the neurosurgery market and we sell our bident r bipolar tissue management system through independent dental product dealers 
we cannot assure you that these distributors and dealers will commit the necessary resources to effectively market and sell our neurosurgery and dental product lines  or that they will be successful in selling our products 
to the extent our marketing and sales efforts are unsuccessful  our business  financial condition  results of operations and future growth prospects may be materially adversely affected 
our products are extensively regulated which could delay product introduction or halt sales the process of obtaining and maintaining required regulatory approvals is lengthy  expensive and uncertain 
although we have not experienced any substantial regulatory delays to date  there is no assurance that delays will not occur in the future  which could have a significant adverse effect on our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis 
regulatory agencies periodically inspect our manufacturing facilities to ascertain compliance with good manufacturing practices and can subject approved products to additional testing and surveillance programs 
failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can  among other things  result in fines  suspensions of regulatory approvals  product recalls  operating restrictions and criminal penalties 
while we believe that we are currently in compliance  if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements  it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we are dependent on key suppliers for some of the components we use in our products we rely upon single source suppliers or a single contract manufacturer 
for example  we currently subcontract the manufacturer of our disposable cord and tubing sets with a single manufacturer 
while we believe there are alternative sources available  we would be required to qualify and validate a new supplier s or contractor s  which could lead to a disruption in our operations and ability to supply product for a period of time 
we face uncertainty over reimbursement failure by physicians  hospitals and other users of our products to obtain sufficient reimbursement from health care payors for procedures in which our products are used or adverse changes in governmental and private third party payors policies toward reimbursement for such procedures would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and future growth prospects 
we may be unable to effectively protect our intellectual property our ability to compete effectively depends in part on developing and maintaining the proprietary aspects of our bipolar technology 
we cannot assure you that the patents we have obtained  or any patents we may obtain  will provide any competitive advantages for our products  or that we will be able to maintain a competitive advantage after our patents expire 
we also cannot assure you that those patents will not be successfully challenged  invalidated or circumvented in the future 
in addition  we cannot assure you that competitors  many of which have substantial resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies  have not already applied for or obtained  or will not seek to apply for and obtain  patents that will prevent  limit or interfere with our ability to make  use and sell our products either in the united states or in international markets 
patent applications are maintained in secrecy for a period after filing 
we may not be aware of all of the patents and patent applications potentially adverse to our interests 
we may become subject to a patent litigation the medical device industry has been characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights  and companies in the medical device industry have employed intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage 
we cannot assure you that we will not become subject to patent infringement claims or litigation or interference proceedings declared by the united states patent and trademark office to determine the priority of invention 
we may have product liability claims our products involve a risk of product liability claims 
although we maintain product liability insurance at coverage levels  which we believe are adequate  there is no assurance that  if we were to incur substantial liability for product liability claims  insurance would provide adequate coverage against such liability 
our operating results may fluctuate we have experienced operating losses at various times since our inception 
our results of operations may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter based on numerous factors including the following o the introduction of new product lines  o the level of market acceptance of our products  o achievement of research and development milestones  o timing of the receipt of orders from  and product shipments to  distributors and customers  o timing of expenditures  o changes in the distribution of our products  o manufacturing or supply delays  o the time needed to educate and train a distributor s sales force  o costs associated with product introduction  o product returns  and o receipt of necessary regulation approvals 
the market price of our stock may be highly volatile during the fiscal year ended september   our common stock has traded in a range of and per share 
the market price of our common stock could continue to fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors  including o our ability to successfully commercialize our operations  o the execution of new agreements and material changes in our relationships with companies with whom we contract  o quarterly fluctuations in results of operations  o announcements regarding technological innovations or new commercial products by us or our competitiors or the results of regulatory approval filings  o market reaction to trends in sales  marketing and research and development and reaction to acquisitions  o sales of common stock by existing stockholders  and o economic and political conditions
