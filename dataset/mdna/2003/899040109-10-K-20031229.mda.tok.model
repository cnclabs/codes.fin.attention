the most significant decline in contract manufacturing segment was related to reduced product demand from a major customer for which the company manufactures and packages a variety of consumer products as well as unit price adjustments to the customer 
contract manufacturing also declined due to strong competition from numerous suppliers of converting services to produce branded sheeting  copier papers and engineering rolls for oem customers and who compete primarily on low pricing for a declining market of available sales 
in the second quarter of fiscal  this segment received its last significant order from a large manufacturer of wide format printers and copiers before the customer s decision to reassess its inventory stocking program and change suppliers 
printing and laminating services offered by the contract manufacturing segment were down slightly from the prior year as well 
the company s business imaging segment continued to experience strong competition from numerous suppliers resulting in a negative impact on sales volume in the engineering and data processing products from the segment 
the decline in sales for those products in the business imaging segment were somewhat offset by an increase in receipt roll sales to the segment s network of product distributors

table of contents fiscal year ended september  compared to september  continued gross profit declined million and margins declined to in fiscal from in fiscal the largest factor contributing to the decline in margin percentages was the pass through of raw material costs in certain contract manufacturing agreements which basically contribute additional sales dollars with little or no margin dollar contributions 
for this segment  reductions in volume as well as unit price adjustments to a major customer also contributed to the million decline in gross profit 
the decline in sales due to strong competition from numerous suppliers of converting services to produce branded sheeting  copier papers and engineering rolls mentioned earlier accounted for part of the decline in gross profit 
business imaging gross profit increased million or due to a change in sales mix related to growth in receipt roll sales to the segment s network of products distributors discussed previously 
also the segment improved margins by shedding overhead from underutilized production assets and reducing its dallas  texas manufacturing facility size when it exited from the contract sheeting market mentioned earlier selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were up million or  compared to million for  primary due to increased expenses for outside professional services  rising health care costs  increases to the sales force late in fiscal and employee recruiting costs

cumulative effect of accounting change is the result of the company adopting certain provisions of sfas no 
 effective october  under sfas no 
 goodwill and certain other intangible assets are no longer systematically amortized but instead are reviewed for impairment and any excess in carrying value over the estimated fair value is charged to results of operations 
in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
 the company completed the transitional goodwill impairment test during the second quarter of fiscal as a result  an impairment charge of million million after tax  or per diluted share was recorded related to goodwill at certain business imaging and paint sundry reporting units

the contract manufacturing segment s sales are made pursuant to project specific purchase orders as well as contract service agreements with terms of months to three years 
sales under such contract service agreements are typically derived from customer directed purchase orders based on unit volume projections supplied by the customers and demand generated by the customers consumer bases 
during fiscal  the company was informed by a customer which accounted for more than of consolidated sales during fiscal that at the end of the contract term december   the customer had decided to stop ordering certain products from the company and would manufacture those products at its own facility 
those products accounted for approximately of fiscal revenues 
while the loss of these products could result in a significant reduction in revenues  on december  the company announced it had signed significant contracts with new and existing customers for both printing and contract manufacturing 
the company believes that the revenue generated from these new contracts  on an annualized basis  should more than offset any revenue decline resulting from the products being removed 
however  because the company s contract revenue agreements described above do not have minimum purchase requirements  there can be no assurances that the revenues attributable to such contracts will be sufficient to offset the loss associated with the products being removed 
to satisfy the manufacturing requirements of the new contracts discussed above  the company is undertaking a capital equipment expansion program aggregating approximately million for fiscal included in this expansion program is doubling the capacity for wet wipes production  a new flat pack folder  and a rebuild of an existing quarter folder 
the company anticipates such amounts will be funded by cash generated from the sale of the paint sundries segment  cash from operations and bank borrowings 
on march  the company sold the paint sundries segment for approximately million in cash to trimaco  llc and its affiliate 
the sale included all paint sundries segment assets  including the stock of foremost  inc and the company s manning  south carolina facility

on march   the company entered into an amended and restated credit facility with jp morgan chase bank the credit facility 
the credit facility supersedes the prior credit facility in its 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources continued entirety and  among other things  reflects the release of the lenders security interest in the assets of the paint sundries segment and reduces the available amount of the revolving loan under the prior credit agreement from million to million 
the credit facility expires june management has received a proposal from jp morgan chase to extend the credit facility for two and one half years and to increase the available revolving amount from million to million on substantially similar terms as currently exist 
the company can make no assurances that the credit facility will be extended or replaced 
at december   the company had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility  with million available under the revolving credit agreement 
management believes its operating cash flow  together with amounts available under its credit facility  are adequate to service the company s long term obligations as of september   and any budgeted capital expenditures 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of the company s assets and contains certain restrictive covenants  including  minimum required cash flow  maximum allowable indebtedness and maximum allowable capital expenditures 
at september  the company was in compliance with all of its debt covenants under the credit facility 
on july   the company entered into an interest rate swap arrangement with wachovia bank  na formerly first union which had the effect of creating a fixed interest rate on the company s term debt 
this swap was terminated effective with the repayment of the term debt under the prior credit agreement

sharp increases or decreases in the costs of key commodities  such as paper or polyethylene  could periodically impact the company s inventory values and net income 
in fiscal years and  the impact of inflation was minimal on the company s inventory and net income 
management believes that the company is generally successful in eventually passing these fluctuations in raw material prices to its customers through increases or decreases in the selling price of the company s products  although the timing of selling price increases may lag behind cost increases 
prior to these periods  the impact of inflation has been minimal on the company s inventory and net income 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a of regulation s k

the reported financial results and disclosures were determined using significant accounting policies  practices and estimates as described below 
we believe the reported financial disclosures are reliable and present fairly  in all material respects  the financial position and results of the company 
financial statement preparation requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingencies at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the period 
actual amounts could differ from the amounts estimated 
differences from those estimates are recognized in the period they become known 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer and there is evidence and there is an agreement and collectibility of consideration to be received is reasonably assured  all of which generally occur at the time of shipment 
sales are recorded net of sales returns and allowances 
shipping and handling fees billed to customers are recorded as revenue and costs incurred for shipping and handling are recorded in cost of sales 
amounts related to raw materials provided by customers are excluded from revenue and cost of sales 
trade accounts and notes receivable management estimates allowances for collectibility related to its trade accounts and note receivables 
these allowances are based on the customer relationships  the aging and turns of accounts receivable  credit worthiness of customers  credit concentrations and payment history 
although management monitors collections and credit worthiness  the inability of a particular customer to pay its debts could impact collectibility of receivables and could have an impact on future revenues if the customer is unable to arrange other financing 
management does not believe these conditions are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the collectibility of its receivables or future revenues 

table of contents critical accounting policies continued management estimates sales returns and allowances by analyzing historical returns and credits  and applies these trend rates to the most recent months sales data to calculate estimated reserves for future credits 
management estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts by analyzing accounts receivable balances by age  applying historical trend rates to the most recent months sales  less actual write offs to date 
management s estimates include providing for percent of specific customer balances when it is deemed probable that the balance is uncollectible 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions 
inventories inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined under the first in  first out fifo method of inventory evaluation 
the company estimates reserves for inventory obsolescence and shrinkage based on its judgment of future realization 
a large portion of the company s inventory is saleable to multiple customers and a portion of the inventory is manufactured to specifications provided by original equipment manufacturers and is not subject to rapid technological change 
management does not believe changes are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the valuation of its inventories 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations 
in order to calculate goodwill  management applies judgment in determining the reporting units  which represent distinct parts of the business 
the annual goodwill impairment analysis involves estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and comparing it with its carrying amount 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  additional steps are required to calculate a potential impairment loss 
calculating the fair value of the reporting unit requires significant estimates and long term assumptions 
any changes in key assumptions about he business and its prospects  or any changes in market conditions  interest rates or other externalities  could result in an impairment charge 
the annual test for impairment of goodwill was done during the third quarter of fiscal at the reporting unit level 
the fair value of the reporting units was calculated using a combination of an income and market approach with the conclusion that no impairment existed as of october  note to the consolidated financial statements contains additional information on the company s accounting policies
